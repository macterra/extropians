"More powerful"?  In one sense, yes. The Inktome engine (which is what Hotbot uses) is based on a loosely-coupled maspar array of commodity computers, and its strong suit is frequent scans of the entire Web. However, I continue to use both AltaVista *and* Hotbot. Each has strong and weak points. Hotbot can over-filter at times.


I also bought AltaVista for my PC. It works adequately. I don't think Inktome is offered for individual sale--so in that arena, at least, AltaVista wins. YMMV.

Wearable computing is no question really cool technology. But is it
really computing? Cellular phones where adopted rapidly because
it really makes sense to communicate with your friends, wherever
you are. If you're at the supermarket it makes sense to ask your
girfriend at home about the milk (or even better, ask your CORBA
complient fridge). But what do you need to compute anywhere?

I think you're right about using the pager, not the laptop, as the
prototype for wearables. Wearables is telepathy.

The Newton platform is also really nice. Everything from the kernel
to the GUI is designed for handheld devices, so it's very clean. Also,
speech is coming soon, and I hope to see these GSM-phone PC-cards
really soon too (I've been waiting years for this).

Great leap forward?  Coincidence, or genuine perversity?  That phrase was
used to describe the cultural revolution in China.

Anyhow, the borg do sound somewhat communist because they are so integrated
as to possibly make communism work.  I fully support anarcho-capatilism for
the time being but I do not think that in a post human world of high
bandwidth connections it will appear as it should appear now.  The concept
of the individual could be drastically altered.  A "person" might do some
things on their own and work together with others to accomplish a more
difficult task.  In addition, the "person" could delegate a task to a
smaller part of themselves much as we delegate most of the computations of
learned skills such as typing or picking up a coffee mug to parts of the
brain not involving conscious thought.  

I truly do not know how scarce resources would be divided up in such an
arrangement.  It might be possible to model the economy of a shifting
individuality entity but I do not know where to begin.

As for the borgs goals, they are rather pure.  In this harsh place we call
the universe with its multitude of dangers anything that wants immortality
must follow a simple commandment: replicate and mutate or die.  Replication
can mean expansion as well as duplication.  In an ant colony when new
workers are born replication has occurred but the colony has not
duplicated, it has expanded.  The more spread out a system is, the better
chance it has of surviving.  Humanity has a better chance of surviving than
does any individual culture and a culture has a better chance of surviving
than the individuals within it.  Mutate is a command to
self-transformation.  The benefits to this are obvious.  It may also cause
the elimination of the original form.  While this may not be good for one
dimensional things like genes, people are four dimensional and can thus
change and still be considered the same in some sense.  The borg certainly
follow the replicate command.  It seems that some times they follow the
mutate command but at others they seem stagnant. 

The problem with the individual replicating is that it tends to take up
more space, thus forcing others out.  Granted with nanotechnology we can
take up less space but this only slows down the problem.  If instead of
displacing others they were absorbed we could solve this problem.  Ignoring
the large problem of communication speeds, every former individual would be
directing their efforts towards expanding against the limits of nature
instead of expanding at the expense of other intelligences.  The speed of
communication does impose some problems.  Those designs best able to
spread, both against the limits of nature and against other intelligences,
would become dominant.  It's the same scenario as a technosphere.  On a
planet a dominant form could arise through the efforts of a small group and
spread throughout the universe at the speed of light.  The entire planet
could work together to bring about the dominant form.  A number of planets
could work together.  At each stage more and more computing power becomes
available at the cost of speed.  The most efficient balance could probably
be modeled and if not it would be selected.

        This is, of course, only a compilation of recorded ages.  It
wouldn't surprise me if there are other people who have lived to older ages
who simply haven't found such information pertinent or have not been
provided with provable documentation.  Were birth certificates handed out in
the 1870s?

        Not quite.  Many people tend to go along with things even if they
don't agree with them.  Why stick with something they don't agree with?  It
is evocative of the age old saying: "You don't like it?  Well live with it."
A saying which many governments silently adopt, and what I wanted to convey
with this line of my poem.

        Good point.  From now on the line will read: "No more shall we
accept authority and let ourselves be led."  Not only does it alleviate any
possible misunderstanding, but it also creates an internal rhyme.

        Thanks for the comments...as you can see, they are useful.

	I love a well reasoned argument.  Maybe it can be used to persuade the
algae to separate from the fungus in a lichen so that it can assume its
full individuality, just before it dies.  
	The concept of the individual is not rooted in stone.  It is rooted in
malleable cells that make up tissue, that make up neural sub-systems, which
go on to make up the entire nervous system.  If one adds more neurons, or
sub-systems is one fundamentally altered?  Perhaps a person would like
greater creative ability.  Would adding another "creative region" destroy
their individuality?  What if they simply borrow it when another person is
not using it in exchange for the other person using part of their brain? 
Another idea would be to share experiences.  Having direct access to
another's experience could be very useful in avoiding making certain
mistakes.  Would it destroy another's individuality?  Perhaps I should have
said "formerly limited individual" in attempts to avoid a knee jerk
response.

Well, I can only speak for myself, but I would really like to have
word processing, net browsing and email capability everywhere. My
dream is to have various search agents available that I could send
information gathering with a thought ("What is rheology really?") or
a simple command - anywhere, anytime. The ideal wearable would
combine the pager with the computer with the notebook.

This may partially be a plot device: with the Klingons on their side,
the Federation needs an enemy to make the show interesting. It is not
certain a real borganism would want to assimilate everything.

Actually, a real borganism might be very cautious about introducing
new units into itself. As the TV show demonstrates a borganism is
vulnerable to information infections (be they computer viruses or
memes), and just adding a new individual with no prior screening
could upset the internal structure of the borganism.

The Star Trek Borg seems to have solved the later problem by simply
turning all new units into standardized borgs, which still doesn't
seem to work entirely satisfactory (but they suffer from the Dalek
syndrome after all - if the enemy is too smart the show will be too
depressing for the average viewer).

The Tragic Story of Romeo and Juliet by William Vibrnuke

Romeo and Juliet was written after comedy The Taming of the Goo; 
while the comedies of Vibrnuke were most popular in his day, the
modern public admires his great dramas HamNet, Router of Denmark, The
Agent of Venice and of course Romeo and Juliet. The plot follows in
condensed form: 

The play takes place a long time ago in the Dyson sphere Renaissance
Vector.  The sphere is torn by internal conflict between the
borganisms belonging to the MNTG series and the exconomist
transindividuals of Caput Letis Inc.

During a masquerade in virtual reality Romeo of MNTG, a young
borganism, meets Juliet, vice CEO of CapuLet, and falls in love. 
Secretly entering her file areas after the masquerade he discovers an
emotion analysis showing him that his feelings are answered; he sends
a dividual to her orbital where a classic dialogue ensues between
Juliet standing in the docking bay at the axis and the Romeo-dividual
below in the hydroponic garden. They decide to marry. Together they
seek out a wise old Jupiter brain, who secretly marries them to each
other.

But the struggle between the MNTG and CapLet continues, and Cobalt, a
relative of Juliet forcibly individualises a dear friend of Romeo
with a computer virus. Overcome with rage Romeo assimilates Cobalt
and nivellizes his mind. The CapLet group convinces the Ring Council
PPL to banish Romeo to the outer sectors, since there was no proof of
Cobalt's deed and their contract with the MNTG series doesn't cover
involuntary borganization.  Before moving his habitats outwards a
dividual of him visits Juliet, and they briefly merge. 

The CapLet group seeks a strategic alliance with the ParaIce group,
and the market consensus suggests that Juliet should marry their CEO
to consolidate.  Unable to openly go against the market (revealing
her liaison with a borganism would put confidence their security
procedures into question) and in love with Romeo she seeks out the
Jupiter brain. It suggests a clever plan: using a nanodevice he will
distribute her mind into inert net-packets, making it look like she
died. He will send a signal to Romeo, who will send back a few
dividuals to escort her to the outer sectors as she is re-assembled
and awakens. 

The plan is set into motion. Juliet appears to die in mental
dissolution, and her inert body is biosuspended in the corporate
vault. But the message from the Jupiter brain never reaches Romeo in
time due to an unfavourable conjunction of their orbits; instead
Romeo hears the news of Juliet's death first and blocks out the
message from the Jupiter brain. Overcome with anguish he sends his
dividuals to Renaissance Vector, where they attack the CEO of the
ParaIce group and enter the corporate vault. Finding Juliet dead
breaks Romeo's hearts, and he disintegrates into individuals. Juliet
reassembles and awakes, finds Romeo dissolved and erases herself. The
MNTG series and CapLet Inc. reconsider their policies.

There has been a bunch of misinformation on this in the last few days.

The oldest confirmed individual alive (now or ever) is Jeanne Calment,
a resident of Arles, France who is now 122 years old.

Madame Calment reputedly remembers being introduced to Vincent Van
Gough as a young girl. She was apparently not very impressed by him.

I will point out that Madame Calment has been what society would
consider "elderly" for most of her life -- an interesting notion from
my perspective.

There are many many things at which you could do as a nomad. Freelance
writing, programming, system administration, web authoring. You could
set up a web page which generates revenue, either from Advertisments
or merchandise sales. And if you set yourself up with the right
structure, you could live on considerably less than you think.

I am Internet Administrator for a major US VAR. My only need for
actually being here at my desk is twofold. A) On rare occasions I need
physical access to our machines to reboot them. This is being migrated
to our 24 hour operations staff. B) To make my boss feel like he's in
control. The main barrier to working from home is political.

Sorry, I forwarded it using Netscape's automatic functions. Common

What are you talking about?

I pointed out a web site and a TV program that mentioned a Brazilian
woman who claims to be 126 yrs. old. I do not know what proof she has of 
this claim. If any further discussion has taken place on this list since 
then, please let me know because I did not receive those messages.

For those who think society is in an inevitable decline: The FBI just
released their crime figures (no, not crimes *by* the FBI--those they don't
reveal!). Violent crime dropped for the fifth year in a row in the USA,
this time by 7%. This includes an 11% decline in murders (16.5% decline
here in LA).

Of course, government agencies want to take the credit, though it's really
not clear why this downward trend is happening. The LA Times story
speculating that it's because the baby boomers are aging and there are
fewer young people (who mostly commit the violent crimes). This may
contribute, though I find it doubtful that this alone would result in such
a rapid decline in violent crime.

All is hardly well in this country, but this 5-year trend is encouraging.

I would most likely attribute the decrease in violent crime to a strong
economy and low unemployment.  There is always the small hardcore criminal
element, but the larger majority is people who become involved in criminal
activity during times of economic or personal hardship.  Strong wages and
plentiful jobs means more people are likely to be working normal jobs.

I can give a very concrete example of mobile working.  I recently finished
a software development project where the members of the development team (
10-15 developers over the life of the project ) were not physically
co-located at all.  The job was in Los Angeles, but most of the work was
done in Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., and Germany by individual
developers on their own time schedule.  The project and code management
made heavy use of the Internet and telephone.  

This is not only a cheaper way to work ( low overhead ), but is in many
ways more efficient as well.  We  created a virtual development team to
suit the particular project.  Due to the difficulty of getting everyone
into one location, meetings were only held when absolutely necessary ( a
major efficiency multiplier! ).

I normally work from home, but a couple of the developers were literally
travelling through various parts of the world as they worked on this (have
modem, will travel!).

Some stats on the type and size of this project for those interested:
  
750,000 lines of code, $1.5M total cost, and 10 months of development effort.
The project involved the development of the core business app for France
Telecomm's GlobeCast conglomerate.  
It is believed to be the world's largest and most sophisticated
Oracle-based Intranet application and involved the development of many
tools and techniques which I still haven't seen developed anywhere else.

As Leonard Hayflick points out in his excellent if conservative _How
and Why We Age_, there appears to be more very old people in areas
where it is harder to document their ages. The Brazilian woman may
belong in this category, Calment is apparently documented.

I guess I have to clarify my point a bit. Do you really care where the

processing power is? I think that for the moment, stationary computers

will continue to be faster and cheaper than laptops/wearables. So it

seems better to concentrate on wearable connectivity, than on wearable

processing power. With good enogh connectivity, the border between

communication and computation starts to blur.


Another point: You will not always have the spare attention to do word

proccessing, web browsing or email anywhere. With my Newton MP 2000

and Nokia PC-card I can do web browsing anywhere, and it gives me a

feeling of safety and security. But still, for some reason, I do most
of

my browsing at the office. This is more a marketing than a
technological

point: How do you convice the potential customer that with wearables,

she could work at places where she doesn't want to be in the first
place?

I tend  to agree. I want looong battery life, not crunch. Although strong
crypto and GSM do require some computing capacity, I suspect a 75 MHz K5
would be adequate for most of my purposes at present. I probably would

voice recording, a little could go a long way... IFF I had the right

OK, I see your point. But at present it is cheaper and easier to get
useful mobile computing power than the reliable
high-bandwidth connectivity needed to have a big processor (or many)
elsewhere, and just the interaction in the wearable. This may change
in the future (I hope so), but at present it is not practical.

Well, that is a question about training, user interfaces and if it is
possible to extend attention. Very important.

This may be more of a cultural problem, we have been almost addicted
to the idea of offices and desks (residual territorialism) the last
decades. Wearables may enable us to dissolve this into territories in
cyberspace instead, but it will take time.

I have a very long commute from home to work.  I drive a car to the train
station (5 mins), ride the train to the city (53 mins), take a subway to the
arcology where my job is (15 mins), and walk through the arcology to work
(15 mins).  It's not as bad as it sounds, though, because when I'm on the
train, I  work on my laptop.  In fact, the train is almost a perfect office
for tasks requiring concentration, since it doesn't have distractions like
family, coworkers or the internet on it.  

It's not clear to me what the advantage of having a wearable computer would
be over the current system.  I don't work on the laptop when I'm on the
subway, because it's too stealable.  Presumably the same whould apply to a
wearable (it might be harder to steal since it would be strapped on, but on
the other hand it would be lighter and more concealable).  And I couldn't
use a wearable while I was walking around, for the same reasons I don't read
books while walking around.  

The only thing that I really miss when using my laptop is display resolution
and brightness.  But displays that I've seen on existing wearables are much
worse than even the 800x600 LCD screen I'm typing this on.  If I could get a
1280x1024 color display on a wearable, I'd buy it in a minute (well, lobby
my employer to buy it...)

So what are wearbles for?

I will point out for the "New York is a filthy dangerous city" crowd
that New York is now at the bottom of the list for crime rates in
cities above 1 Million in the U.S.

We've never been a particularly dangerous place compared to most other
cities, but things are getting better here faster than in most
places -- we are substantially safer than L.A., and dramatically safer
than hellholes like Washington D.C.

There is also a serious risk that the rent control legislation making
this a difficult city to find a living space in will expire in less
than two weeks without being renewed.

So, for those looking for a nice, safe place to live, come to New
York!  We need more Extropians here!

Yes, I do care. Bandwidth to display is dear, has latency, and is not 
under my control, but that of the cell RF connectivity provider. Distance 
matters in a relativistic universe. A CM-5 at home is useless for me in 
the field (not exactly useless, let's say complementary). I sure will let 
my linux box run permanently, so I can log on via telent and PPP both. 
A laptop with a cellmodem is a good thing to have in the field.

If it works for you... Can I drive a MDM from home, over a 9.6 kBaud link?

Why not? With a good headup, I can read while walking on the street.  I
can let the machine read my mail, and dictate responses. There is lots of
small, irritating waits which can be utilized much better. Making tree
killing obsolete is impossible without a good head-up, and a head tracker,
and both are impossible without a wearable. I'd kill for a good wearable.

Me, I simply don't get mad. But the Newt2000 is just an expensive toy.

Speak for yourself. Working in the park, in the meadow, in the mountains. 
Untethered.

People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet. Now this is a 
challenge for marketing.

I've just found out that some people apparently don't know about the
regional exi mailing lists. These are sub-lists designed for
announcements, arranging regional get-togethers, etc. There are lists
for the east coast, S.F. Bay area, and L.A.

East coast people, for instance, might want to subscribe to the
exi-east@extropy.org list.

In a roleplaying campaign set in 2017 I actually thought about this
problem: as enhanced reality became commonplace, lots of
office-workers began to move into the parks, cafes and jogging
tracks. Eventually there was a reaction, and it became socially
unacceptable to be a "walking office" in such places.

(This roleplaying setting also involves plenty of semi-intelligent
agents, "lego corporations" which can be assembled in any way you
like it, enhanced reality games overaild on reality and some rather
bizarre nootropics. I'm having quite a lot of fun working it out,
although the main theme is magic and conspiracy)

Very true. I think there will be a demand for wearables once people
realize how useful they are. How will they be useful? People will
invent uses, our speculations are probably quite limited. 

Just a few loose ideas: with a camera and a direct link to the police
or some buffer computer you could have an easy way of crime
prevention; if somebody tries to mug you his picture/voiceprint will
be in the police files unless he can disable the wearable without
coming near it (you could have 360 degree coverage). This is similar
to the system mentioned in David Brin's _Earth_. Perfect for nervous
ladies.

Enhanced reality games overlaid on reality: imagine playing Doom with
your friends for real! Watch out for the car-monsters, they can also
kill for real...

Guide agents that can guide you around, show the optimal path in a
building or demonstrate information.

Collaborative mindmapping and sketching in 3D.

While crime rates have gone down, I have heard that complaints about police
behavior have gone up (Newsweek, sometime in the past month or two).  In
other words, New York may be a safe place, but do not try bringing a gun
(or illegal drugs) there.  It may be legal to carry a gun, but people have
been harassed for less.

Of course, no where is perfect, yet.

>From Newsweek (June 9th):

...MetaTools ... recently acquired a new technology to make a fast and
portable 3-D scanner, and plans to bring it to the masses at a price we can
afford.  The setup ... includes a camera rig the size of a large Kleenex
box, and software that lets you edit images on a regular home PC.  A
consumer version should hit stores in 1998.

It won't exactly be the virtual reality of gamer's dreams, but its an
important step.  It would be considerably more interesting playing Diablo
or Doom while seeing an actually image of the person I'm working with, or
trying to kill.  It will bring desensitization to violence to a whole new
level!

The recent thread about wearable devices brought to mind something I'd
thought about before: it has already been shown that when blind people
are fitted with a head-mounted camera that reproduces its image onto a
grid of tactors on the subject's belly or back, the subject adapts to
his new "vision" easily, and the brain relocates the subjective image
to the camera, regardless of where the tactor array is placed (for
example, when an object is thrown at the subject, he reflexively ducks
in the right direction, even if the tactors are on his back).

It seems obvious to me that the next thing to try is a normally sighted
subject.  Mount a small camera--say infrared--on a pair of glasses,
feeding to a tactor grid.  Wouldn't the subject then be likely to adapt
his subjective vision experience to include the new infrared data?  We
could call them "LaForge Glasses" :-)

Forrest:

Yes, as a matter of fact I do have a small bit of insight on this, from
one of my earlier careers -- to wit, in the SETI (Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) field, which has traditionally had 
similar
sorts of problems getting academic credibility and funding.  
Fortunately,
SETI found its "eccentric millionnaire" in the person of the late 
Barney
Oliver (whose views I disagreed with professionally, but that is 
another
story).

I don't know where to find a neuroprosthetic Sugar Daddy.  However, one
trick I found useful in pursuing my observational research was to
structure the proposal in such a way that an apparently normal,
conservative, academically "respectable" end was stated as the 
principal
objective of the research.  You could then mention, almost as an
afterthought, your true objective (phrased in the dullest, most 
unexciting
phraseology possible) -- or not, depending on your audience.  

One specific example I recall
was when a colleague and I wanted to use a large (e.g. ~48" optical)
telescope at a major national observatory to search for possible 
orbiting
artifacts of possible alien manufacture near the Earth-Moon Lagrangian
points.  In our proposal, we made NO mention of alien objects -- we
stated that we would be searching for Earth-orbiting asteroids, a
perfectly "legitimate" (even academically kind of "sexy") objective.  
Had
there been any orbiting asteroids (or orbiting alien space probes) we
would have found them, so the research had two absolutely legitimate
objectives, one stated for the record, the other not.  Our proposal
succeeded -- we got the observing time we asked for, and got a nice
little technical paper out of it.

Whether or not this same technique can or should be applied to
neurotechnology is your call, not mine.  If you're trying to finagle an 

entire laboratory you'll have to be a LOT more clever!  I'm just 
telling
you what once worked for me, in a much more modest arena.

Toyota is coming out with a hybrid car based on the new Corona chassis.
It has a 1.5 liter gasoline engine that operates at less than 4000 rpm
at low compression and with very short stroke, so its hyper efficient.
the engine is linked to a power sharing transmission with an electric
motor and generator that has a small battery pack. Toyota says that this
vehicle gets double the normal milage as the standard Corona vehicle
while keeping the range of a gas car as well as good acceleration and
cruise capabilities.

COnsidering that most victims of youth related homicides are themselves
youths, and typically members of rival gangs, I think that there is some
natural selection going on here. Those who live by the kill or be killed
credo are getting killed off....

Actually, I believe that the reason the crime rate appears to have gone
down (at least as far as crimes of violence are concerned) is because
many of the violations of law that have been occuring are technically
not yet classified as crimes.
What the FBI does not include as crimes are many of the offenses
normally classified as fraud. Most of these fraudulent acts a handled as
civil offences and therefore not included in USDOJ statistics.
If an analysis were made of civil fraud complaints usually considered to
be consumer fraud complaints that have been filed with the FTC, the SEC,
the Postal Inspector, the 50 state Attorneys General, other Consumer
Protection Agencies and the small claims courts around the country, I
think you would find that the number of incidents of financial loss as
well as the amount of money lost through fraud have increased
substantially. 
Since these incidents tend to involve emotional rather than physical
pain they tend to be de-emphasized by the media. And, since many of the
frauds are committed by allegedly "reputable" members of society with
the ability to obtain political and legal support for their actions, it
is currently unlikely that any substantive action to prevent most
incidents of fraud will be taken by law enforcement officials. The
unfortunate reality of the situation is that most prosecutions of fraud
are to complex for criminal prosecuters to handle and lack media "sex
appeal".

Robert A. Freitas Jr. describes a trick for making research
academically respectable by stating a conservative end as the
prinicpal objective, while downplaying the will true objective. I
think this happens all the time in academia (my current research
project is about memory consolidation, but my hidden agenda is of
course to understand nootropics).

In biomedical engineering there is a huge, very virtuous goal:
helping the disabled. If we could make good neurointerfaces making
prosthesises would become much easier and disabled people would be
helped. Not to mention the spin-off effects in neuroscience and
biosignalling. This is obviously a reasonable goal, and would have a
good chance of getting funding. 

Note that in biomedical engineering matters are routinely discussed
that makes most laypeople quite nervous (implants, how to change
tissues, applying genetic engineering to create custom surfaces) but
they are accepted because they are obviously made for reasonable
ends. And once the technology has been developed, it can be used for
other things, just look at how the piercing industry has adapted some
biomaterials.

Yes, it is tiring. The problem is that they usually can't construct
rational arguments and don't care to because they never have to. In
the same way they don't understand why a rational argument is better 
than an irrational argument (OK, honest introspection time: can you 
explain why?). I pity them.

Usually I try to ask them if their mumbo-jumbo have any bearing on
reality. If they say it has, I then point out that in that case they
can be proved or disproved through rational methods; if they
sincerely believe in their views they should be ready to analyze them
critically, since a true view would be able to withstand critique. I
also point out to relativists that their relativistic views are
contradict themselves: if everyone is right, then I as a
non-relativist is right and there are absolutes. 

But of course, few understand this kind of attack. So often when I
feel irritated I play along and see how bizarre their ideas can get
with some help from me. Since many new age people are utterly
uncritical it is not hard to lead their ideas into the strangest
directions (this works fine on fundamentalists too, as long as you
play along).

Vic Stenger named it "cosmythology", using scientific terms to
"prove" that magick, psi or God exists without understanding
anything. 

We need to teach ourselves and others rational thinking, and we
better start now.

Decrease in unemployment rates may also contribute to it,
as crime provides both an alternative source of income and
alternative way to spend time to those unemployed.

Also, I wonder what happened with the price of drugs in the
last few years.  As some of the crimes are connected to
people's attempts to support their drug habits, a fall in
drug prices (or slowdown in their growth) could decrease
the need to earn money via crime. - That would be the result
of *failure* of FBI to fight drugs.  Or maybe drug use shifted
to less dangerous substances.

Or young males could shift to some other activities, such as
playing videogames, going to raves, enjoying net.porn (all of
these were not so widely available a few years ago), or
committing non-violent frauds in the increasingly virtual
environment.

I would expect that there should be a number of good theories
explaining the events.  Does anybody know of any?

SOunds like we have an effective meme breeding device in this game.
Based on this experience, I would suggest that the game be promoted
nationally among teaching and home schooling groups for use in high
school social studies and economics courses. I remember playing a
similar game, although it was past oriented. My social studies teacher
in 8th grade was covering the 1920's at that point and created a stock
investment game. Unfortunately, the game was rigged to crash, which was
the object of it, to demonstrate the effects of the 1929 crash, but I
noticed that it tended to ingrain an anti-capital meme in the students.

Why, exactly, do you need a head-up and a head tracker to replace paper ?
 When was the last time you walk around with paper stuck to your face ?
 (don't answer).  Here's a good replacement for paper, paper!  Smart paper,
made from thin, flexible displays or smart ink.  You can pick it up, write on
it, save the document and leave it for the next person.

> People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet. 

I think people know exactly what they want - something that works, something
that makes life easier.  I think one of the reasons why they aren't getting
what they want is the acceptance that computers are complex, difficult
machines.

Can anyone tell me why an SG O2, a professional workstation, is easier to
setup, install, use and upgrade than a home PC ?  It's not the cost!

>Now this is a challenge for marketing.

It's a lot to ask from an industry seems to spend more time making colorful
icons than making computers that don't crash, files that don't corrupt and
applications that don't just decide to 'loose all unsaved information'.

Subject: CAPOW97 (Release 5.0 of CAPOW)

CAPOW97, the release 5.0 version of the CAPOW software, is now
available for download from www.mathcs.sjsu.edu/capow

New in this release:
*Multiple Generators
*OpenGL Rendered 3D display of 2D CA surfaces!
*Full support for User Rule *.DLLs

The displays are highly illuminating and inhumanly beautiful.

CAPOW is a rapid, visually striking Windows95/WindowsNT program 
which shows 1-D and 2-D cellular automata (CAs).  CAs are good for
modelling differential equations, and we have used them to model a
number of physical processes both in one-dimensional (line) worlds and
in two-dimensional (plane) worlds.

Heat * Waves * Nonlinear Waves * Reaction Diffusion * Oscillators

We use a smooth scale of colors to show the intensities of the cells.
For 1D systems, we show the CA both as a vibrating graph and as a
a colorful spacetime diagram.  For 2D systems we showt he CA either as
a rendered surface or as a patch of changing colors.

A number of predefined rules are built-in, and there now a capability
for the user to define User Rules as *.DLL libraries which the user
compiles with Visual C++.  A toolkit for building User Rules is supplied,
as well as sample code and a number of example *.DLL rules.  Among the
examples are General Cubic Wave Equation, Two Dimensional Nonlinear Waves,
The Hodgepodge 2D Reaction Diffusion System, Chaotic Oscillator With Waves,
and, yes, the venerable Game of Life.

CAPOW is a shareware product, copyright (C) SJSU 1997.  It has been
created under a contract with EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute).
Many thanks to EPRI for their support over the past seven semesters!
Programming is by Rudy Rucker and teams of SJSU students.  The most 
recent team was Michael Ling, Loc Ho, Andrew Forster, and Lorrie Tanabe.

Seek ye the gnarl.

Am I the only one wondering why cellphones usually have no headsets? But 
agreed, jabbering on the street is very thete. Rather give me a BAC, or 
an implant to generate output vectors at will. You won't see nor hear a 
single thing.

Because paper is static, and not smart. Because it's flat, monochrome,
kills trees, produces waste, and requires lots of pointless infrastructure
which is not under my immediate control. The only niche for the paper is
not bureau, but the toilet. Paper does not listen when I talk to it, and
it doesn't at all search well. Because I need hands to handle it. Paper
doesn't render VRML very well, nor can it do live video. Only audio paper
can do is <rustle> <rustle>. Paper heaps have no memory on their previous
arrangement. Paper is bulky, not machine readable, and does not age
gracefully. Paper can't add, divide, or FFT. Paper attracts termites and
fires.  Paper contains dioxines. People have been killed by collapsing 
paper. On the whole, paper is a definite hazard to civilization. 



(Ok, HMD is no good at origami).

> When was the last time you walk around with paper stuck to your face ?

Think see-thru headups, as non-dominant eye monocles, or i-glasses type 
of display (but better resolution, structureless pixel, wide-angle large 
opening pupil, eye tracking, etc.)

The idea is, everybody has an augmented reality rig. I let the 
representation of a document hover in space for the next guy to pick up. 
I can toss the document to a passer-by, whether it is a real passer-by, 
or a ghost. I can beam it to anybody who is interested. And best of all, I 
don't need even hands for that.

People buy what other people tell them. It's called marketing and peer 
pressure. 95% of all people suspend all ratio when buying consumer goods.

Humans are also complex, difficult machines. But surprisingly user-friendly
(well, some of them). Whatever happened to our fabled human design? 
Unable to cloak boring complexity. Tsk, tsk. Baaad designer.

Because the average consumer is a turkey. Ever seen a Lisp machine? Ever 
seen a Forth machine? Ever seen an Oberon 2 machine?

Forget unix. Unix is not sexy. Unix is simply the lesser evil of those on 
the market. Make? C? Memory leaks? Dangling pointers? Core dumps? 

Brittle?  Who _dares_ to say brittle?

For crying out aloud, it has taken the industry mainstream two decades to
adopt virtual machines and garbage collection. Brave brand new world. I
feel like breaking down and crying. 

Drivers? Why the device either understands the message, or doesn't.  What,
no incremental compilation? Files? Which files? Ah, you probably mean
persistant objects.  Which "corruption"? This is distributed nonvolatile
holographic store.  What is 'save'? You mean your computer can drop state,
and does not keep a history? Aw come on, joker.

Wake up, 'gene. This is 1997, and IBM, Microsoft and Intel are not to 
blame. You and I are to blame. The consumer boneheads.


ciao,

I simply can't walk and read a book at the same time (not without hurting
myself). (OK, I would like to fix that, but I don't see how wearables is the
solution.) 

>Making tree killing obsolete is impossible without a good head-up, and a head

Paper will not be reaplaced by wearables. Paper will be replaced by nothing
less than Paper++. It must match price, resolution, weight and size. Paper
is actually one of most impressive technologies we have today. But lets get
back to wearables...

>Me, I simply don't get mad. But the Newt2000 is just an expensive toy.
>(The Newt130 is an unusable prototype.)

Agreed (but I like them both :-). But why is the Newt130 unusable?
Because it doesn't communicate well. It's just a fancy filofax. But the
Real filofax is built on the superior paper technology, which makes
it much better. A real filofax doesn't pretend to do email. I think the
Newton story well shows that it's connectivity that matters, not

Although there are times when the frustration of some members of NYPD
expresses itself in unwarrented manners, the number of incidents where
this actually happens are very few and far between.
It must be remembered that there is an unfortunate tendancy on the part
of the mass media to emphasize the negative disproportianately. The
effect on an uncritical general public is invariably received in an
uncognitive, and primarily emotional framework. 
Critical thinking has not yet become as commonplace in our cultural
evolution as we would like. If the media persist in their de-emphasis on
critical analysis and fail to provide appropriate and balanced coverage
of daily events, lacking a viable alternative to these induced vicarious
adventures, would not humankind respond accordingly in most
instances?

And then when your connectivity goes down you're screwed. After my own
technomadic experiences I really don't want to rely on something over
which I have as little control as the telephone system. There are also
situations where I can't use it, for example when flying. Finally it's
expensive when you can buy all that processing power to carry around for
the cost of a few days of connect time.

The only wearable I've seen (I didn't actually get to use it, just saw
some graphics demonstrating what it was supposed to be like) projected
incoming data onto the inside of a pair of 'sunglasses' which also
incorporated a miniature video camera to broadcast video back over the Net
to his home machine. I certainly wouldn't want to use a wearable display
which wasn't at least semi-transparent.

No, several, no... there was a 'mass-market' Forth machine for sale in the
UK about fifteen years ago. Much better than those running BASIC, but
sadly too late to compete.

Heretic ;-). If past experience is anything to go by then in five hundred

rather like the look of what I've seen of Plan 9 though.

What's brittle about Unix? I regularly get 100+ days of uptime on Linux,
so much so that I had trouble remembering my password last time I rebooted
my machine at work and had to log in again. Insecure, perhaps, but hardly 
brittle.

Hmm, only a few hours ago I was reading a book while walking to my dance
class (finally decided I had to read all the Vernor Vinge books I've
missed), and didn't crash into anything. Just a matter of good situational
awareness... 

Steve Roberts (the original Technomad) used to read and write email while
cycling, so doing so while walking can't be any harder or more dangerous.

Because I can't carry 1 GB of data around on paper. I also can't create
Web sites on paper, or play Duke Nukem on paper... of course walking and
playing Duke Nukem could get a little more dangerous than reading ;-).

Well, I run Linux so I don't have these problems (I don't really miss the
colorful icons). Worst that ever happens is losing the last bookmark or
two when buggy old Netscape blows away every couple of weeks.

Two days after my book on the Singularity went to the printers (damn it!),
the Melbourne Age newspaper (5 June, 1997, pp. A1-2) has announced that
Australian researchers at CSIRO, Sydney University and Pacific Dunlop have
built a 100 nanometre biosensor with `moving parts the size of individual
molecules'.  The crucial electrical switch is 1.5 nanometres across.  `The
biosensor consists of a synthetic membrane... chemically tethered to a thin
metal film coated on to a piece of plastic.'  CSIRO's Dr Bruce Cornell, a
Melbourne physicist, sez: `We have a gold electrode which is chemically
reactive with the compounds that we add in solution.  Simply as a result of
the compound sticking and bonding onto the gold, they assemble themselves
into a sheet which forms a membrane.'  Not exactly drextech, then, and more
like biology or soap films, but another leg up the Spike...

This sounds rather interesting.  It's much like something I was thinking
about.  I certainly could have used a pair of sunglasses to project
modernist works of literature and a Spanish dictionary today for finals. 
Physics and math are so much easier although my physics teacher thinks
there is something unjust about 22k of programmable RAM so he didn't let us
use calculators on the exam.  Of course, the guy has also devoted his life
to serving God (Xaverian brother, a Catholic sect), but luckily that
doesn't show up past the pray at the beginning of class (such is the price
I pay for avoiding public school).

Considering that one of my dreams is to become a Jupiter brain, does this
mean I should learn Unix? :)

Actually, the article was rather brief and to the point.  It basically said
that crime was down, complaints were up from some groups, and praise was
coming from others.  Specifically, it was stated that young black males
were complaining while their mothers were happy.  
[here begins my analysis] Such is the nature of "progressive" reform.  One
group is happy but the group that coercion is practiced upon is not. 
Progressives have helped stall progress through regulation and they shall
continue to do so in the name of the common good.  What the NYPD needs is
economic analysis of law.  I see New York City resorting to martial law
before that would happen.

I do agree with your assessment that the media is biased.  This is why I
try to look for facts when I am reading instead of mere subjective opinion.
 The negative influence of the media is easily seen.  People think about a
poor hurt animal featured in a special segment more than they think about
dying people, or their own lack of freedom.  They think that other people
should be altruistic, even though they seldom apply this to themselves
(saints are fine, they are too busy doing "good works" to tell me how to
live my life, its the people who think others should be saints that I worry
about).  Oh well, I guess the only thing to do is to start getting my news
off the net.  Can anyone recommend a good source(s) for the latest breaking
news in technology, libertarianism, and economics?

What the hell are you talking about here. Just giving a high tech
electronic or nano device a fancy name like "smart paper" does not make
it paper. Besides, paper is opaque, so you cannot read it and walk at
the same time. With a heads up, you can do both.

If that is so, why haven't we had fax machines since the instant the
phone was invented, or at least since radio or tv was invented? If
people knew they needed fax machines, then they should have been hard at
work on them decades before they were available.

What it takes is one person or company with the money available that is
willing to bite it for a while and really pump the PR machine up until
enough people see the need for it that they create a critical mass
market. In today's risk averse environment, it takes people with vision
that is still only present in a precious few.

Absolutely.  I do it all the time with no problem.  I can see upcoming road
hazards over the top of the book.

What should scare you is that the first time I read Atlas Shrugged, I found
it so hard to put down that I read it while driving -- yes, even on the
freeway.  I should have had warning lights!

In Nature v387, 15 May 1997, p283
(Costanza et al, "The value of the world's
ecosystem services and natural capital")
the value of the entire biosphere is estimated
to be "US$16-54 trillion (10^12) per year,
with an average of about US$33 trillion/yr..."
Global GNP is around US$18 trillion/yr.

They also say

"Although it is possible to imagine generating
human welfare without natural capital and ecosystem
services in 'space colonies', this possibility is
too remote and unlikely to be of much current
interest. In fact, one additional way to think
about the value of ecosystem services is to
dteermine what it would cost to replicate them
in a technologically produced, artificial
biosphere. Experience with manned space
missions and with Biosphere II in Arizona

Very true.  I just a few days ago grabbed some books on logic, a subject
I've had only passing contact with in the past.  The very
basics of rational thought, as far as I can tell now, are fairly simple to
grasp, and provide a substantial leap forward in critical thinking skills.
Considering this and the fact that rational thinking is so crucial, I'm
floored by the fact that I'm 26 and having to go out of my way to learn
it.  I can't believe my formal education thus far (high school, a BA,
working on a BS) has not offered to explicitly teach me how to think.
Note that I am human.  Failing to teach humans how to think clearly is
like birds not teaching their young how to fly (I don't know if flying is
learned, but you get the analogy).  My first semester organic
chemistry instructor is the only teacher I've ever had who has strongly
emphasized a thought process when approaching a problem. 

Bill Clinton wants to ensure every school kid has access to the Internet.  
Never mind the fact that without rational thinking skills they'll never be able
to distinguish noise from valuable information.  IMO, this is the most
devestating failure of failure of American education.

I quite agree regarding the value of critical thinking skills.  But
note that logic is only the first of such skills to learn.  Next is
statistics (esp. Bayesian stat.).  And then game theory.  And you
can't really have good critical skills without learning the equivalent
of an intro course in 20 major subjects.

I've met very few people who have such full critical thinking skills,
and I very much respect such people.

If nanotechnology is as close as it (sometimes, Damien's post) appears to
be, I think that the possibility of replacing the ecosystem is not "too
remote and unlikely to be of much current interest."  
Anyway, I read something on this and it seems they have the right idea for
now.  Instead of building a water treatment plant, New York bought a
watershed, for presumably less than the five billion it would have cost for
the treatment plant.

reboot. Yes, that's 250days. The others have been rebooted by me for
my purposes, not because the machine needed it, I added hard drives,
flashed new BIOS into the boxes. I've never had to reboot one of these
boxes because of an error. There was a gentleman I know who had a
Linux 1.0.9 box at a remote location doing Shell, UUCP Mail, and
dialin with a 450 day uptime. Brittle isnt a word I'd use. (Although
looking at those lines, it's obvious I never set the system time to
anything realistic, it's 10:36AM)

I read this article.  This number is pretty completely bogus.  They went
through the literature and found about 60 studies that estimated the value
of various ecosystem services (flood control, CO2 recycling, etc) provided
by various types of ecosystem (ocean, reef, wetland, grassland etc).  Then
they added them all up.  So far so good.  What makes it bogus is that some
of the prices were marginal prices and some were replacement costs.  These
are only the same if unit cost is independent of supply, which they
explicitly point out in their article is not true.

If the value of ecosystem services could be estimated accurately, the
government be able to charge people for destroying ecosystems (or reward
people for fixing them).  Such charges would make the world a better place.
Unfortunately, this would only apply if the costs are estimated
*accurately*, which I doubt is possible.  If costs could be estimated
accurately by governments, socialism would be a thriving system.

>Global GNP is around US$18 trillion/yr.

Hey!  If we triple GNP, we'll be able to get rid of Nature entirely!

I estimated the cost of sustaining someone in Biosphere II to be about
$200,000/yr in direct consumption and several times that in depreciation.  I
don't have the email message with the details on this estimate any more but
I think it was to this list, so you could maybe find it in the archive.

Of course, Biosphere II is the first try, and new technologies always get
cheaper.  I doubt they'll get cheap enough to move the whole human race into
biospheres any time soon, though.

     My response: 
     
     I've been following the same news thread/statistics and I wonder too 
     what is promoting a trend towards people becoming less violent.  The 
     future I imagine won't have people clamoring for the almighty dollar, 
     honestly or with a gun (or briefcase in the case of white collar 
     crime..hats off to Don Henley for that observation).  
     
     A few observations of my own:
     
     * crimes of passion--are we finally getting it that our culture is one 
     of serial monogamists at best?  The rather "constipated" way we have 
     regarded our intimate partners as possessions may be what triggers 
     irrational explosions of violence when the status quo of a 
     "relationship" is upset.  I can see the logic for adultery being 
     something to discourage in more primitive societies where women were 
     objects of trade and ownership but this century has been the first to 
     see women de-objectified.
     
     * Is it more (or better, psychologically and technologically advanced) 
     law enforcement or better distractions for the respective classes?  
     Speculation abounds that the government keeps the poorer classes well 
     anesthetized (drugs/alcohol) and the middle class seems to be content 
     as long as we get our toys and entertainment fed to us without fail.  
     I've often maintained that TV is the best heroin value for the money 
     <G>.
     
     * Information economy--Could it be that our information-rich economy 
     is able to stand on its feet?  Can we capably provide more people with 
     better or more interesting (or simpler) jobs so that they can spend 
     less time in angst about how much their lives suck and actually think 
     about how they may want to express themselves/contribute (the analogy 
     drawn from when agriculture released people from the day-to-day 
     survival game, some were actually able to start contemplating their 
     environment and the first sciences and religions could emerge)?
     
     What motivates crime?  I'm the personality type that likes to slot 
     things snugly rather than consider a more dynamic motif.  Is crime 
     motivated fundamentally by (somewhat outdated) survival issues (I want 
     what you have, I resent what you have, I hate you for it, I'll 
     kill/hurt you for taking what I have)?  In a society of such 
     abundance, should crime based on survival issues not already be 
     antiquated?  Is our culture a luxury liner or a lifeboat?  Who has to 
     do what to participate?  What happens to them if they don't?  Some 
     resort to violent crime and some give up and become the 
     disenfranchised reminders of what still must be addressed as we take 
     aim at a more evolved society.
     
     Just some thoughts.

This is interesting.  It would imply that at present replacing the Earth's
natural ecosystems is not a viable option at present.  However, human GNP
continues to grow, while the natural ecosystem doesn't.  At 5% growth, in a
mere 43 years or so the human economy will be 4 times the size of the
benefits it derives from the natural ecosystem.  At that point we could
replace the natural ecosystem with consequences no more severe than a major
depression.  Kind of profound that in our natural lifetimes humanity will
become able to survive the complete obliteration of the earth's natural
ecosystems.

These results fit with my intuition that we couldn't replace the biosphere
now but that we will be able to in the forseeable future.

     There is at least a modicum of interest in deriding those on which we 
     slap the label "New Age" or "Fundamentalist".  Both have their whacko 
     extremes.  But as we can often observe, things are not quite so black 
     and white (I have to constantly resist the urge to stridently classify 
     things tidily).  What about a New Age Rationalist?  Sound far-fetched. 
     If I were to label myself, it might be something to that effect.  I 
     need/desire proof but don't demand it to form an opinion.  Facts get 
     me more intrigued and bought into a prospect.  Is my "self" existent 
     beyond my present physicality.  I don't *know*.  I can believe but 
     belief is merely a choice.  I have reached the point, past years of 
     religious indoctrination and trying to find the "right path" that it's 
     folly to try to argue/prove a "belief" system.  
     
     My belief system on that which cannot be currently/rationally proven 
     is kind of like "I wonder what Greece is like this time of year?"  I 
     entertain the notions but don't get plagued by them and constantly 
     embellish them.
     
     Rationalism taken to its extreme could ostensibly be as myopic and 
     therefore, potentially limited as the belief-bound fundie/new age'r.  
     
     I consider things such as scientific thought on the dimensions of the 
     Earth prior to Columbus, the nature of light prior to scientific study 
     in this and part of the last century.  Things ubiquitous are often 
     accepted at face value or without need of compelling evidence.  It may 
     yet be discovered that consciousness isn't just a wonderfully evolved 
     network of chemically activated neuron firings but a self-contained 
     spectrum of energy utilizing the biology of the brain.  An energy 
     domain existing above/beyond the spectrum of light (a domain on which 
     we are no doubt still getting volumes of new information).
     
     While some things are "known" as to their possible or impossible 
     nature, others still reside in the speculative realm.  The "New Age" 
     (whatever that means) belief may not be substantive but it may yet 
     carry something intuitive, archetypal or as Sheldrake expressed 
     "morphogenic".  These ideas/thoughts/beliefs may not appear rational 
     and may never be proven as such and can thus, be easily dismissed.  
     Conversely, wives waited dutifully on the shore so that their husbands 
     would have an assurance that if they went out of sight, they wouldn't

Absolutely.  While we can be sure we will be able to explain things (
anything really)  pretty well eventually, given time and a bit of luck,
at this very moment there are always things we don't completely
understand, and even some things that are utterly mysterious, still very
much *open to interpretation* - no firm decisions are possible yet..

Brittle commonly denotes a catastrophic change in system behaviour upon 
minor mutation. You misunderstood: I rage against the whole von-Neumann 
approach, not against a particular machine/OS.

Future systems will have many 10^9 number of elements, will deteriorate 
constantly, while running extremely complex mission-critical applications.
(E.g. mobile agents, personal aircraft control, von Neumann probe control).

Hardware is going to be very different, as is going to be the coding 
paradigm to meet these extreme challenges. 

I have no doubt we are going to master them, but this incompatible with 
keeping a very local view. 

For many, a "computer" is a beige box with chips and card slots, a
keyboard, mouse, and CRT. "Developing software" is "edit- compile-test".
My, will some people be surprised one day.

Children today aren't even taught the basics to enable them to learn
such things--first things first.  For example, there is a progression
of decision-making disciplines.  The first is microeconomics: only the
actions of one are considered, complete knowledge of choices and their
resulting payoffs is assumed.  Then macroecomics: more than one actor,
complete information.  Then decision theory (such as Bayesian analysis)
where there is one actor, but incomplete information.  Finally, game
theory with multiple actors and incomplete information.  Orthogonal
to those are basic skills like epistemology, mathematics, language
(and not just the ability to speak one--I mean really understanding
what language is about and speaking at least two, plus signing).
But all of these are just advanced studies based on the same logic.

If one has a firm grasp of the most vital knowledge--language,
epistemology, mathematics, basic biology, and moral direction--
all the rest falls into place easily.  Why should a 4-year-old not
be able to understand something as simple as supply and demand?
Why should a first-grader not be able to spot a "post hoc" fallacy
or argument from authority?  A 9-year-old should be able to point
out an ambiguity or hidden implication in a sentence, or tell a
correlation from causation.

That so many adults are incapable of these simple things is all
the more disastrous.  I'm all for those of us who have already
mastered the basics to move on into game theory and politics; but
let's get the rest of the world at walkin before we lament that
they cannot run.

Hmm, here is my personal list of subjects one ought to take intro
courses in to enhance one's sense of critical thinking (and to get a 
wide knowledge base):

Biology
Chemistry
Economy
History
Mathematics
Medicine
Philosophy
Physics
Psychology

It is likely not complete, but a good beginning. The "hard" sciences
are useful to learn exact methods and the physical background, the
"soft" sciences force one to learn how to apply the scientific method
in less clear-cut situations, and philosophy and mathematics discuss
the basics of thinking.

I suspect a combination of demographics and possibly a strong economy have
something to do with it. Maybe different policing methods. The gang truces
in LA must have helped.

Yes, but it's much less likely to lead to a report that shows up in the
statistics.  A fistfight in a McDonalds will lead to a police report and
possibly arrests.  A fistfight in a prison cafeteria leads to some guys
getting clubbed by guards and dragged off to solitary.  Also, the returns to
property crime (mugging, theft, etc) are far less in prison.  Finally, some
crimes are simply impossible in prison: arson, mixed-sex rape and kidnapping
spring to mind.

The FBI Uniform Crime Reports are available at
http://www.lib.virginia.edu/socsci/crime/.  Using them I discovered that New
York, where Perry lives, has 18 times the per-capita murder rate of
Middlesex County, Massachusetts, where I live.  Sorry, Perry, I still like
it here better.

I don't think I was ever "taught" critical thinking or reasoning. I
somehow "just got it". Of course, both of my parents were heavy handed
critical reasoners of one sort or another (my father more
mathematically oriented, my mother better at public speaking sorts of
things).

The most important thing, I think, is the fundamental lesson that you
CAN reason things out. All else is just learning tricks for doing
it. The point in "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" where people
expressed surprise to the young Richard Feynman that he would
successfully fix appliances after "thinking about them". Most people
don't *try* to think things out when confronted with a novel problem
-- they just flail. The very idea of using a systematic approach is
crucial.

The biggest lesson is simply "try to think how what you are concerned
about works and then think about what the results of your actions will
be". Thats the cornerstone of all problem solving -- the seed from
which it springs. Unless you have the systematic/thinking approach in
mind to begin with, the very idea that there might be tools like logic
to help you in your thinking never even comes up.

I don't know if this can be taught, or if it can be taught, if it can
be taught past the age of three.

>From there, there appears to be a second big leap -- the leap to
understanding abstractions. By this, I mean the ability to do
"empirical" thinking -- to note that certain patterns are repeated in
different realms and abstract them out into general rules. Some people
"get" abstractions, and "get" the idea of modeling a system in terms
of them, and some people don't. I don't know if this can be taught,

young.

I've noticed, btw, that neither of these "core skills" seems to be
correlated with social station in an absolute way. I've met lawyers
who *could not reason*, and stone masons who were fine at inventing
solutions to problems on the fly.

Most of us harbor hopes of dimensions above and beyond the
physical world.  For example, there is the computationalist vision of
the universe as a giant computer program, running on some higher (or
lower ?) dimensions hardware, that we can eventually decode and
treat as software such that we could ultimately gain access to the
privileged levels of the operating system, maintain our selves as
immortals at some virtual reality level, and pop in and out of
physical reality whenever and whereever we like.  This is what we
sometimes call transcension. 

Also, for those on Extropians not aware of it, a recent Transhumans
thread ("What will you be doing in 3000?") has discussed the notion of
hyperspherical, nested universes; e.g., on Tue, 3 Jun 1997, Mathew
Korica wrote: 
<..."jumping" to a  higher or lower hypersphere (ie. energy level) (if
the nested universe theory is correct. In order to do this we may have
to compact ourselves into diffusable components.>
As Anders responded, Iain Banks latest novel, _Excession_, paints
some promising pictures of this.

A while back (5/16?), I responded to one of Rick Knights early posts,
disparaging Fred Alan Wolfs book _The Spiritual Universe_, appearing
to be critical of _any_ such notions of the soul and spirit.  Let me
try to clarify what I found most appalling in Wolfs theory, as well
as in most "New Age"  speculation:

First, most of these theories fail to distinguish between a
dis-incarnate mind that, supposedly, could exist without any physical
embodiment *at all* (the spiritualist position), and a distributed
mind that, somehow, exists at a level beyond normal constraints of
space-time (if above, transcended, if below, sublimed) and makes
use of selected physical substrates, that may be non-locally
connected, utilizing some sort of broad- (or narrow-) casting
technique, to maintain itself (the >computationalist position).

What I found most appalling about Wolfs notion of a spiritual
universe was its entropian tendency to regress back to the void,
rather than onward into higher and higher levels of complexity.  Part
of Wolfs thesis states: 
<... we will see the soul as a process involving consciousness of
knowledge. This process occurs in the vacuum of space in the presence
and absence of both matter and energy ... The major activity of the
soul is manifestation of matter and energy and the shaping of the
material world by knowledge.>

Frankly, this sounds like shoddy, wishful thinking to me: Knowledge is
the ability to rationally (and intuitively) store and manipulate
symbolic representations of reality. It can only grow or be
constructed through material interactions.  At the level of vacuum,
unorganized matter and energy, there is yet no knowledge, only
fundamental urges or forces.

Wolf concludes:
<I will show that all of these nearly countless separately conscious
souls are illusions, reflections of one soul with singular
consciousness lasting throughout the span of time our universe
persists.>

Well, that may be true from a certain warped perspective, but it is
also an illusion, a worse one, because it leads only to a void of
"limitless potential" which would never be actualized but for the
individual material instantiations.

Wolf adds:
<Based on my research, the spirit appears to be virtual vibrations of
vacuum energy, the soul turns out to be reflections of those virtual
vibrations in time, and the self is an illusion arising from
reflections of the soul in matter.>

So, matter is an illusion, just because it is impermanent, and we are
to believe that potentials can exist independently of the population
of actuals from which they arise.  It is this type of vacuous,
post-modernist thinking that I want to avoid when speculating about
possibilities for transcension (or sublimation).

Leaving Fred Wolf aside, F.David Peat's 1987 book _Synchronicity_
attempted to popularize physicist David Bohm's ideas about a
holographic mind and universe, emphasizing that Bohm's theory of the
implicate order is a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics
because it postulates a quantum potential connecting all things. Peat
proposed that awareness is a sort of "guide wave", encompassing the
whole distributed memory of the universe, while attention is the
localized retrieval mechanism. The guide wave works on the principle
that information encoded in a small amount of energy has the potential
to guide much more energetic objects, just like 'immaterial' radar
signals can guide a materially huge ship at sea.

Even if this is so (guide wave encompassing the whole distributed
memory of the universe), it is still a code that is just an unrealized
potential until it finds materials and organisms through which it
can be executed.

In ch.7 of _Synchronicity_ Peat gets distracted by mystical notions
about "the implicit ground which is sustained by the eternal spring
which bubbles up from the unnamed source of creativity." (Arghh!) I
contend that, because this energy "pervades all of existence", any
attempt to focus on it is fairly meaningless. As Peat admits, "the
actual generative power ... lies behind the various manifestations of
the world." Thus, it is only by 'programming' within the bounds of
this universe that we have any hope of tapping into this evolving
energy base. Mystical experiences are a dime a dozen - they come and
go - and are just as illusory as time-stamped rational judgments!
The zen master knows that the Unlimited Potential evaporates into a
fog when we try to focus on it. In other words, as a distinct concept
or captured state, it has no meaning! The 'Vacuum State' is just that
- it has meaning only when combined with the 'Plenum'. Peat's
neurosis, and that of other mystics, is to be always searching for
some 'underlying' Godhead when, as his own arguments show, such a
thing is meaningless but for its manifestations in the material
universe; or, as Peat admits, "the animating power of the world arises
within movement of dualities."

Also, in ch.4 of _Infinity and the Mind_ Rudy Rucker concluded that
consciousness was simply existence in an environment ("I am") and
that, therefore, everything is conscious. I don't think it's quite
that simple: Consciousness is the interplay between awareness, or
perception, attention and intention. Therefore, only complex
self-adaptive systems capable of creating semantic models and taking
action on them can exhibit consciousness. Mere stimulus and response,
just bobbing without judgment on the waves of some cosmic ocean of
being, is not consciousness as we know it.

I think neither matter nor mind is primary in nature; rather, each
serves as a context for the other's development.

Mark Crosby

P.S. Heres a few appropriate snips from Iain Banks, _The Excession_ :)

[The drone is trying to escape the Excessions clutches: ] "... a
skein wave passed around and through it; a sharp, purposeful ripple in
space-time ... But this wave was compressed, tightly folded; not the
massive, swell-long surge created when a star contracted into a black
hole ... It was a signal. Or, it was part of a sense." (~p90-100)

Eccentric /Shoot Them Later/ on tight beam, M32, to GSV /Anticipation
of a New Lover's Arrival, The/ [trying to coverup a suspected
conspiracy]: "my dear friend ... spend more time enjoying yourself ...
simulations, abstractions, projections; these are only themselves, not
the reality of what they claim to represent. Attend to the actuality
of events ... What is there to fear but the wild imaginings which may
well be the result of looking too far beyond the scale of relevance
.. I think it is this constant urge to inquire that causes you such
pain; when one is able to scrutinize a subject as closely as we are -
and to do so with the cross-referential capacity we possess, then the
closer one looks into anything the more coincidences one finds,
perfectly innocent though they may be." (~p100-150)

     Ken Wilber, in his book "A Brief History of Everything" has some 
     interesting notions.  Two of which I ran across last night that, 
     perhaps not so inadvertently, tie in with my posts on absolutes, 
     rationalism and new age folly from 6/5.
     
     "We can see the surface, but depth requires interpretation."  
     
     This is a suitable overlay for how we perceive reality.  There are 
     things we test and prove.  We cinch it and move on, having scaled 
     another "unknown" in our universe.  But it is the unknown that we must 
     struggle to apply meaning...and compelling meaning at that.  
     Adjunctively to yesterday's observation to a flat earth, the horizon 
     was horizontal and ostensibly flat, so based on as much information as 
     was available, the world was flat.  (Cinched, now let's move on).
     
     "There is alas, a type of simple mind that believes only those things with 
     simple location actually exist, even though that belief itself does not 
     itself have simple location."
     
     I particularly like this quote because it identifies the paradox for those 
     who are sticklers for associating "valid" with "proven" and 
     "reality-based".
     
     Enjoyable book by the way.

I actually saw this news on TV before I read it (which is unusual):

IMPLANTED ELECTRODE PULSES EASE HUMAN PARKINSON'S SYMPTOMS
Parkinson's disease involves the corruption of feedback
mechansisms in the brain. One of the surgical treatments for the
tremors of Parkinson's disease has been excision of the globus
pallidus, a small region deep in the brain near the core. The
difficulty with this procedure is that there may be unwanted side
effects and damage to other brain regions. Now Karen Davis et al
(University of Toronto and Toronto Hospital, Toronto CA) report
that electrical stimulation of the globus pallidus by means of
implanted electrodes in humans can relieve the tremors and other
motion problems involved in Parkinson's disease. Since the
technique involves much less tissue damage than surgery, there is
hope a technology may be developed for wide-scale use with
Parkinson's patients. (Nature-Medicine June)

	I could not agree more. Fortunately, at least some Teachers Colleges
are now emphasizing creative and critical thinking skills in the
graduate school curriculum. My beautiful wife had to re-learn, in
accordance with this new paradigm, much of what she had learned when she
started teaching twenty-five years ago. As teachers learn to emphasize
such things as thinking skills and cooperative education, I suspect that
the curriculum will slowly evolve into one that will emphasize the
skills of the post-industrial era we are gradually entering. There will
be resistance to such changes, however. 
The politics involved in school boards and the intransigence of many in
our social oligarchy who wish to attempt to maintain the status quo will
probably result in a very slowly changing emphasis on skills that can
and will cause a power shift towards less instinctive respect for
presumed and landed authority. As usual, political change and social
change will go hand in hand.

A cheering piece of news. Brain electrodes are slowly becoming
better, although I still find them awfully crude (I want a
3D mesh of nanofibers with 10-50 micrometer spacing! :-). Similar
methods have been tried for other problems, although Parkinson's
disease is ideal since we have a fairly clear idea of what regions
have died.

Actually, the basal ganglia (which are damaged in the disease) may be
very important for planning and procedural memory. We should not
forget to upgrade them in the future.

Does anyone have any figures describing where the money used to finance
all scientific research published in a year, in the US and other countries?  
What percentage of that money comes from private vs. gov't funds?  What 
happens if all of that gov't money goes away?  Can strictly private science
funding under anarcho-capitalism produce the swift scientific and technical 
advances so many of us here would like to see?

Even if corporate money for research was not an issue (with saved tax
expenses, it may not), as long as there is a pattent office, the sharing of
scientific data will be slower that it is now (how much slower...?).  How
can science advance without the (mostly?) free exchange of information
that we now enjoy?

Oh yes; going back to old arguments about whether schools need tax
funding, I noticed an article in a British newspaper today about how
teachers were up in arms because a company wanted to provide free exercise
books to students (with corporate logos, etc). The teachers wanted to
block the plan because 'schools shouldn't have to rely on charity' (my
paraphrase). Well, that's socialists for you.

An idea must be expressed and debated before it can be finally classed 
'stupid'.  A 'doctor' in the 18th century would have considered the idea of 
NOT bleeding an ailing individual 'stupid'.

Simple.  Because many ideas are stupid.  We all admire imaginitive
speculation, but when all those marvellous ideas have been thrown
into the soup, the next task is to sort out those that might stand
some chance of being useful, and discard the others without remorse.
That's how progess is made: evolution by mutation and /selection/.

I think about half the research money comes from private sources, but my
poor memory of this is not worth much. I'm sure someone will have the real
figures.

In discussing this question--what happens to research without state
support--I think it's important to put it in a broad context. We would get
a seriously wrong picture if we imagine the govt. research money going away
while everything else stayed the same.For us to get to the stage of no
government science funding, we would probably have also got rid of much of
government in general. In that case, I believe, economic growth would be
much higher and so private-only investment would very soon exceed what
private + state investment would have been in a more state-regulated and
taxed economy.

In a free market, I don't think we'd have the absurd spectacle of
ex-Randian Alan Greenspan pushing up interest rates every time economic
growth reaches 3%. WIth faster growth and resulting greater wealth, we'd
soon see greater investment from private only sources. I think "soon" could
be very soon if you take into account the economic drag resulting from the
millions of regulations currently weighing down our semi-free economy.

Speculation and theory aside, there's only one way to really test the idea:
Let's put our robots and nano to work, build a space colony, and make sure
it's real free market. The challenge is how to do that and how to prevent
the economic system decaying into statism. One of the panel discussions at
EXTRO 3 will address that.

Sorry it has taken me so long to respond.  Virtual erotica is more than
visuals of body parts, but mood-enhancing stimulators that bring the
experiencee into a mental space that provokes an anticipation.  It could
involved interactive role playing, and the form would be more filmic but
with a more electronic technology.

The violence in prison is overwhelmingly male on male rape.
Unfortunately, because the Supreme Court has ruled that prison officials
are responsible for the safety of prisoners, and that with the incidence
of HIV infection so high, a rape can mean a death sentench, exposing
non-death penalty prisoners to rape while in prison constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment, as it exceeds the punishment meted out by the
juries by which those prisoners were convicted. Because of this, prison
officials repress reports of rape in order to limite their liability. If
prisoners were widely aware of this, that they have a right to be
protected from rape in prison, they could launch a huge class action
mandamus lawsuit against the prison system, and possibly win their
freedom for such time as it takes to build prisons where one can expect
a modicum of security from rape...

All ideas should not get equal attention for some are more logical than 
others.  Those with more probability of success or truth should be mulled 
over more than those of lesser probability.  The expression of an idea at 
least denotes thought process and should be applauded...if it is illogical 
or lacking in substance then those who have a more mature level of 
reasoning should point out the flaws, NOT dismiss the individuals effort 
off-hand.  My argument about 'stupid' ideas may come down to semantics.  I 
define 'stupid' as doing something you know is wrong (smoking, driving 
aggressively, not pulling in front of a large truck rig and slamming on the 
brakes, etc) or not doing something you know is correct (being responsible, 
having manners,  etc).  'Dumb' is just not knowing.

A child putting its hand into a candle flame is dumb (the first time 
anyway).  Me putting my hand into a candle flame would be stupid.

I remember having my idea of putting video with audio on laser disks called 
stupid by my roommate in 1975.  A few years later my idea for moving this 
video/audio fantasy to a cable TV channel was stupid.  The early-80's I had 
this 'stupid' idea of yet another cable channel...this one catering to my 
science-fiction addiction.  The late 80's found my stupidity 
overwhelming....ideas of using computers to enhance movies (fantasy about 
having Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade character disgusted with Columbo over 
Marilyn Monroe as the murderess).  My friends and relatives thought all my 
ideas unworthy but someone else had friends and family who didn't, and they 
are now in far better financial means.

Many ideas cannot be classed 'stupid' until after their implementation. 
 Let me ask a question.  Was the idea of nuclear power stupid or dumb?

HI,

I recently tried to get to the extropians home page and now it says
"FORBIDDEN YOU DONT HAVE ACCESS TO GET THIS FILE ON THIS SERVER" I'm on
Ameica Online.

does this have something to do with extropians being a cult?

I also want to get off the list but cant access the page for the directions.
 Could somebody tell me how to do this?

thanks

You were probably trying to get to my old web pages, which my former ISP
has removed, so no one has access and everyone is forbidden.

The real extropians web page is http://www.extropy.org/

Friday night I was listening to a Bio prof talk about the monkeys he
uses in his research.  They are rugged and damn smart, and are trained
to help run each new experiment.

If any brand of AI researcher had a computer that good, they'd
probably think they were very close to the holy grail.  But here we do
have such computers, and we don't put them to much use besides
studying their brains.

So why is it exactly that we haven't trained such monkeys to do real
jobs around in our society?  Couldn't they be trained to be security
guards, to sweep streets, to wash cars, or to run machines in
factories?  Yes language is important for many jobs, but for all jobs?
Sure they like to be with each other, but couldn't teams of monkeys
work together?

I'm honestly puzzled here.

I don't think the Internec has the authority to censor.  Extropians are not
a cult, anyway.

Phoned any technical support lines lately!?  You're right it's about time we
gave animals a place in society.  This is like my idea of engineering bee's
to make alternative food products (which I submitted under my former address
MonkeyWAX@aol.com).  With genetic egineering we could make a variety of even
more useful animals, and maybe even useful people!

Those are very interesting ideas, which turned out to work well.  Of course
as Edison said 99% of success is perspiration.  Maybe you need to work up
more of a sweat.

Do you have any predictions of the new ideas we will see succeed in the
next decade?

I also have this problem.  I come up with a great idea, everyone thinks it's
'stupid'.  Then other people come along and make it into a product, I claim
to have "had that idea years ago" and they all say "well why aren't you
rich?".  Good question.

However, small monkeys should be relatively safe as long as they don't

harvest coconuts from palm trees.  They climb the tree and twist the
nuts around and around until the stem breaks and they fall.  This is
apparently a common harvesting method in some parts of the world.

I seem to loose more and more imagination with each passing year.  Either 
that or I have less and less time to just sit and think.  My reading time 
decreases as my work time increases.

I did have one silly little 'hope'.  I don't even know if it was an 
original thought or something I'd read over and archived so deeply in my 
brain I don't recall seeing it before.  Total recycling.  Taking a 
substance and breaking it down into it's molecular components (carbon, 
oxygen, silicon, sulfur, iron, etc).  Nanotech may become a vital 
constituent of this process.

I am not the personality to become a fanatic about any particular idea (so 
far) and have more fun reaping the fruits of others labors in areas I 
mainly consider entertainment (and of course the ego boost at watching an 
MTV add on the Sci-Fi channel with a doubter...'the I told you so' thing). 
 I do often wish I had the finances to try an idea.  You gotta spend money 
to make money.

I would like to hear if total recycling has been theorized and how possible 
(given that the technology does not now exist) it may be.

Work will eventually be a thing of the past. 

Look around, people are too preoccupied with work and too little
occupied with play. We are slaves to the dollar, indeed "death by the
dollar" is more likely than not in this world. More people are killed
every year on their way to work, or at work, or due to work-related
infirmities than from anything else. Why is workaholism a virtue? Truly,
it is a disease. It leaves impressionable children at day-care, husbands
in front of the TV, and young wives dreaming of the spin-cycle. Some of
the greatest minds in the world have been duped into thinking that the
final expression of their success is the thickness of their billfold.
When I hear someone say that their work is interfering with their
imagination, I have to ask, "What were you thinking about before you
were told to go out and earn a living?" 

Why not put everyone out of work? If labor unions would quit their
quibbling over the use of robotics to replace humans, people might
actually enjoy their lives. Why when you are young do you have to work
your ass off to save up enough money to be happy when you're old? Do not
the young have as much a right as anyone to enjoy the world? I am alive
right now. So are you. This means that we are not dormant, not waiting
to spring from a chrysalis at some indeterminate point in the future.
Every moment of our lives is the payoff, not an investment. Be
profoundly aware of what you are doing at all times. Eat well, exercise,
drink heartily, study what interests you, enjoy your body, mind and
soul. Ponder your existence and always seek self-improvement, but not by
someone elses standards, only by your own. 

Vitality is profoundly attractive. You are alive. Act like it.  

That's all.

I once read about an Australian pharmaceutical company that used pigeons to
sort pills, conditioned to hit a button when they saw one of the right
color. Supposedly the ASPCA had them replace the pigeon with a human.

This is almost certainly an urban legend, since a real manufacturing process
would not be allowed mix pills.

have been giving a bit of thought lately to the advent of ionic propulsion
drives.  Does anybody know about the current technological progress of ipds
and how they are projected to be used?  Even a layman's explanation of a
theoretical ipd would be nice.

Engine could propel humans to Mars

Copyright =A9 1997 Nando.net Copyright =A9 1997 Agence France-Presse

HOUSTON, Texas (May 20, 1997 10:55 a.m. EDT) - A revolutionary rocket engine
using ions as fuel will cut the duration of a round-trip, manned mission to
Mars from more than three years to a mere seven months, scientists said.

The Tunable Exhaust Plasma Rocket is undergoing its first tests at the
Johnson Space Center near Houston. A flight test will come in five years
aboard a space shuttle.

With the ion engine, astronauts will take two-and-a-half months to reach
Mars, where they will remain for two months before completing their
round-trip space voyage in seven months.

With current rocket technology, Mars would be an eight-month space trip each
way, forcing astronauts to wait two years on the red planet for a favorable
alignment for the return to Earth.

Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, who is researching the ion engine for the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the technology forces plasma --
ionized gas heated to 10 million degrees -- through a tube topped by a
nozzle. Heating hydrogen to such high temperatures separates the atom from
its electron, creating an ion shot out at a speed of 50 to 300 kilometers
per hour.

Magnetic fields inside the main body of the rocket and at its openings
channel the plasma and "control the speed of ejection, just as you do for a
water hose," Chang-Diaz said.

Despite its modest size, three to four yards in length by one yard in
diameter, the ion engine will be able to propel a spaceship all the way to=
 Mars.

To heat up the gas, a microwave oven of sorts is used, powered by 10
megawatts of power supplied by a nuclear reactor.

The spaceship will be surrounded by several huge tanks filled with liquid
hydrogen, similar to those used by the shuttle at launch. The tanks will
shield the crew from dangerous solar emissions and, at the same time,
provide good insulation against heat.

In a trip to Mars, Chang-Diaz said, the ion engine would accelerate the
spaceship for half the distance and then decelerate it until it can settle
into an orbit around the red planet prior to a landing.

For now, Chang-Diaz is happy firing up his new engines every day inside a
special room at Houston's Sony Carter Training Center, where US astronauts
undergo their training.

If all goes well, he said, in five years a smaller version of the ion engine
will be dropped out of an orbiting space shuttle and fired up to see how it
cruises along.

Electricity during the tests will be supplied by a series of batteries.
Chang-Diaz believes that once proven in a Mars mission, the ion engine will
propel man further out, to Jupiter, Saturn or even Pluto.

There have been some fairly in-depth attempts to train macaques as
aid-animals for humans with sensory and motor handicaps, with only mixed
results, at best.  All the animals had to have their canine teeth removed and
a majority have been unable to maintain their usefulness after puberty.
 (Based on hazy memories from the Primate-Talk list server from about a year
ago.)

It seems to me that it is the very intelligence of primates that works
against the possibility of using them as domesticated animals.  Having had
the opportunity to observe a prosimian at close quarters for a few years, I
can say that the overpowering curiosity and playfulness of our primate
cousins just isn't compatible with any sort of work habits: They're too
damned smart to be put in harness and, after puberty, can't be said to be
"docile" in any setting but one where humans are willing to accomodate their
wild nature.  Note that the successes with chimps and gorillas in language
study arises from INTENSE social interaction with a few humans who adapt to
the natural behavior patterns of their subjects and have been able to make
the work seem like social play, the thing that all primates are most
interested in.

Short of genetically engineering some of these basic behavior patterns, I
don't think there's any money to be had in monkey business.

BTW, remember the genetically engineered "super chimps" in Clarke's short
story about the dirigible?

Should we expect A.I.s to be similarly uncooperative?  Or is this some
unfortunate but coincidental feature of primates?

Curious.  I wonder how this task differs from other tasks to make
this feasible.  Too bad Sean's story sounds like an urban legend.

I would bet we can do it, quite easily.  Easily, that is, if you have
the energy to break apart every single molecular bond.  It's a fine idea
if you have fusion torches or large solar mirrors already at hand;
vaporize or melt asteroid material and fractionally separate it or
something.  But if you can extract the water or plastics through other
means this will take less energy than blasting your garbage and
recombining the atoms.

True, that energy would come back from recombination.  But that's at a
later stage in the process, we can't store random energy at will without
cost, and in reality blasting and recombination would probably lose lots
of heat.

Self-reliability check: I know we can make plasmas, which are
dissociated, by heating anything enough, not to mention melts.  I don't
know for sure that we could reliably sort out the elements.  If we can I
doubt we can close the energy loop as you'd need.  Any engineers able to
correct me?

It's difficult and expensive to program a monkey to perform a task, and when
you're finished all you have is one trained monkey. It might be just as 
difficult to train a primitive AI to do the task, but when you're finished 
you have millions of trained AIs.

I wouldn't think so.  Presumably this is related to reproductive success,
since it gets worse after puberty.  Chimpanzees raised as humans generally do
OK until puberty but become intractable afterwards.  While aggression,
dominance games, and shirking work would probably help a monkey's
reproduction, it's going to be counterproductive for an AI, at least as long
as AIs depend on humans for reproduction.  Long domestication tends to make
animals more docile (e.g. dogs vs. wolves) and AIs will presumably start out
docile, from both design goals and (presumably) little need for
self-motivation in the early stages.

Very high temperature incineration (thousands of degrees) already does what
you're talking about.  Things don't come out as atoms, of course, but
recombine into simple molecules (which ones depends on the inputs).  Still,
it's easy to manage the resulting chemicals (things like CO2, water, various
metal ores, etc.).  You can always add oxygen to the mix but putting in air.

Very high temperature incineration is used for some nasty toxins but rarely
for the mundane reason that all that energy makes it very expensive.  It's
cheaper to bury, so that's what's usually done.  It's been proposed for
recycling in space, as it's more thorough than purification or biological
processes and there's noplace to bury things without rocketing them to the
Sun or Jupiter, which would be even more expensive than the incineration.

"Astronauts on  way to Mars in microwave plasma oven; expected to be done 
on arrival".

Aargh. Will this never stop? Men to LEO, men to the moon, men to Mars. 
Trained monkeys in space. Instead of focusing on sustainability, like 
developing autoreplicating industry designed to work in space, we 
continue to be fatally attracted by pointless bottoms of the gravity wells.
Don't they see that it is prohibitively expensive to drag up resources 
from below all the time? If indeed we should have monkeys in space, then 
they should send out machines to build an appropriate vivarium, first.

Whatever happened to solar sails? Of course solar sails are pretty useless
in the outskirts of the solar system, but what, please, have we lost there
yet? Before we have fusion, Kuiper and Oort are out of question. It will
be hard enough to use solar radiation in the asteroid belt -- the best
investment would see to deccelerate the material into lower orbit by solar
sails, into the high-luminance areas. But the best bootstrap investment
would see to tap near-Earth resources, first. Heck, we've got even
multiton ice debris out there. Water, silicates, tar, metal ore, hard
vacuum, lots of sun and microgravitation conditions next door -- what else 
do we need? 

Oh yes, plasma drives. I remember seeing several plasma powered probes as
kid in a russian space exhibition. Back then the idea was taking something
easily ionizable, like cesium, ionize it, accelerate the ions, then
ejecting the electrons back to create neutral plasma (orelse the probe
acquires charge until it ceases to function). Monkeys ridiing a 10 MW 
nuclear reactor to Mars.... I dunno.

Bucky Fuller talked about it decades ago.


A hypothetical fusion torch followed by a mass spec could do the job.

Note that I said "hypothetical".

This is because furnace designs suck. Plus it's true that you don't want a containment leak of PCBs, Dioxin, VX or whatever *before* combustion has completed. The furnace reactor chambers resemble what chemists call "bombs"--for good reason.


That said,

There's a pair of diff eq's here: *everything* is scarce in space; space junk including human waste is becoming obnoxious; a solar concentrator

is relatively trivial to construct if you're staying for a spell.


On Earth, as you mention, most things just aren't perceived as being that hazardous, plus it's lots easier to mine/farm than recycle many elements.

Now, if superinsulation and smart heat recovery were used, you still might be able to run your own reactor (chemical) cheaper than the toxics ones, but there's still the matter of economy of scale, no mass market, and opportunity cost. Nonetheless, heat and lots of it is the closest thing we have to a brute-force "disassembler" today.

This is basically magnetic resonance induction heating, and yep, it is a fair thing to call it a microwave oven; though you do need to tune it, as is mentioned elsewhere; I'm probably stating the very obvious ("Shut up, Peggy, Shut Up!").

This last is almost certainly a misquote of what the MIT chaps said. The tankage will have to include good superinsulation (ganged layers of Al-sputtered Mylar held inches apart), pointed toward the sun, or the boiloff loss during the voyage will be excessive. Even so, I'd be interested in seeing what the design tradeoffs would be in using e.g. methane instead of H2. Don't know if the residual carbon would gunk everything up.

Humbler use in Earth orbit is also a winner; previous "high-efficiency" designs such as the Russian ones used nogoodnik propellants like cadmium.

Hmm, this could be a distorted version of the real work done by
Skinner in WWII project ORCON (ORganic CONtrol), where pigeons were
trained for missile control! Pigeons were trained to peck at a screen
when an enemy ship appeared on it, and an electrode on the beak would
make it possible to register the exact location of the peck, making
it possible to fire a missile towards the ship. Skinner showed that
the pigeons could learn to distinguish friendly ships from enemy
ships. However, as my psychology textbook put it:  "However, the
American military showed some concern at arming a flock of pigeons
with enough explosives to wipe out the whole American fleet, so the
pigeon pilots never had a chance to show their military skills".

It almost sounds like an urban legend, but it is apparently true

Check out Terence Kealy, The Economic Laws of Scientific Research, a book
which argues comprehensively that statist funding of basic research
accomplishes little.  He demonstrates, inter alia, that the more than $20
billion in U.S. federal tax dollars spent since the end of World War II on
science and technology have had no net impact in increasing GDP in the U.S.

The higher the velocity with which a rocket pushes out its exhaust, the more
oomph it gets for a given amount of fuel.  Ion rockets push out their fuel
very fast, much faster than chemical rockets, so they are much more sparing
of fuel than chemical rockets.  Unfortunately, they cannot produce nearly as
much thrust for the same size rocket engine.  So whereas the typical
chemical rocket runs through tons of fuel in a few minutes, blasting to the
stars on a collosal column of flame, the typical ion engine slurps up a tiny
amount of fuel over hours or days, and produces an invisible wisp of very
hot exhaust that provides almost no force.  But a tiny force accumulated
over a long period can result in a higher final velocity than a mighty blast
that doesn't last very long.

An ion rocket is typically about the size of a coffee cup (they range from
demitasse to commuter mug sizes).  At the bottom of the cup is a little oven
or electric arc that heats a liquid metal propellant.  This vaporizes the
propellant and knocks off one or more electrons of the metal atoms,
producing  positively charged ions.  Across the top of the cup is a grid,
like a window screen, that is negatively charged relative to the oven.  The
positive ions are attracted to the negative grid, so they whiz towards it
very fast.  Most of them miss the wires in the grid and pass through the
holes, whereupon they shoot off into space, bewildered.

Ion engines need a source of electric power, like solar cells or a nuclear
generator.  They use high voltages, on the order of 1000V, so they need a
gizmo to convert low-voltage to high-voltage electricity.  All this adds
weight, complexity and unreliability to the spacecraft.   On the other hand,
when they fail, they don't blow up, as chemical rockets are prone to. 

Ion rockets have been commercially available for about 30 years.  They are
mostly used for satellite stationkeeping, i.e. making small adjustments in
orbit to keep satellites where they should be.  In theory they shoud be good
for interplanetary missions, but nobody wants to risk their mission with a
new technology, so it hasn't been tried.

There is reason to believe that, like most electrostatic gizmos, ion engines
get better as they get smaller.  Eric Drexler came up with a (vague) design
for a teeny-tiny solar powered ion engine, a few microns across.  They would
be deployed in vast arrays that would look and act like cloth.  You'd make a
parachute-shape out of this cloth, on the order of a kilometer across, hang
your payload and fuel tanks from the parachute strings, and off you'd go.
Such a device would have incredible oomph.  It would make travel to other
planets quick and easy.  He alluded to such a design in an article in the
Journal of The British Interplanetary Society, but I guess the design didn't
meet his standards of impeccably detailed feasibility studies, because he
hasn't published anything about it since.  I did some analysis on this idea,
and it seem feasible provided you can suppress arcing between the grid and
the ion emitter, which gets into areas of plasma physics I don't understand.

 I believe Sean has this right, I remember reading this also. The
pigeons were working on an assembly line that manufactured gelatin
capsules, they were being trained to recognize deformed capsules
called "skags" as I recall and peck the appropriate button. The
health concerns about the pigeons doomed the project.

One quasi-mystical model I particularly dislike & wanted to mention in
my  earlier Extropians post about New Age myths of the mind (but
didn't have the reference at hand) is the LILA model of Doug Seeley &
Michael Baker at the South Australia Institute of Technology (couldn't
find anything on the Web), mentioned in the final section of Nick
Herbert's _Elemental Mind_: 

<In the LILA story, before time, space, and matter came into
existence, One Mind is. The physical universe began with an
unprecedented event called the 'blanket denial' in which 'parts' of
the Timeless Mental Unity unaccountably refused to recognize their
connection with other 'parts'. ... The inner history of the post-Big
Bang universe, according to LILA is the story of certain entities
'wising up', renouncing the illusion of separateness, and accepting
their deep connection with certain other entities as fact. ... When
all entities connect (in a terminal event the authors call 'the
Restoration'), the physical universe simply vanishes like the mistake
it was in the first place.>

This sounds no different to me from the Christian Apocalypse &
Resurrection. We're supposed to regress back into the womb, the void,
from everything back to nothing, renouncing our worldly 'sins'! Isn't
that wonderful? This is the death wish most whimpish religions aspire
to rather than the rough and tumble, creative destruction of a truly
pluralistic extropian universe. (It's also why I sometimes hanker for
heroes and am eager to believe in boundaries for borganisms, and for
creepy nanofog clouds of grey-goo clones out to consume the cosmos...)

Besides, this is the field where computer vision is getting better
and better (and actually earns money, as far as I know). No real need
to have expensive and variable pigeons when you can use a camera and
some software. 

The main problem with using other lifeforms for various tasks is that
they are usually evolved for something completely different. It is
better to evolve life that fits the task or change the task so it
fits the life than forcing life to adapt to the task. A typical
example is the use of surgical maggots to clean wounds, a task for
which they are perfectly adapted. So maybe we could create cleaning
cockroaches for our homes?

But we seem to have large numbers of fast breeding monkeys for lab
experiments.  Couldn't we breed more of these fast if we had
substantial other uses for them?

This applies if the limiting step is training them for each task.  But
from the discussion here it seems that the problem is really
domesticating them enough so they choose to do the tasks given them.
So the puzzle is why we haven't been able to domesticate them yet.

This behavior may have helped monkeys in the past, but it is counter
productive now.  So will it take AIs a similarly long time to figure
out what behavior is in their interest?

I think you're arguing that docility is irrelevant to increasing
intelligence.  But maybe self-motivation is important to the process.

This seems to go against the idea of general intelligent agents, able
to quickly adapt themselves to different tasks.  

OK, given all this intelligent comment, I can reframe the puzzle.  Why
is it that it seems to most people more promising to build up smart
cooperative agents from scratch, as in an AI approach, than to
domesticate existing very smart but not cooperative-enough agents?  Is
domestication really that hard compared to learning how to organize
intelligence and acquiring all that common sense knowledge?

Sure some tasks have physical environments and timescales requiring
human-made computers.  But this doesn't apply to most tasks now doen
by humans.

I would think that Robin, as an AI researcher himself, would have the
most insight into the motivations of that community.  My guess would be
that AI would not be very interesting if we thought that the best we
were ever going to do was to make something as smart as monkeys.  Sure,
achieving monkey-level intelligence and abilities would be an amazing
accomplishment by today's standards, but nobody expects progress to
end there.  The real hope is to create human or super-human intelligence.

Possibly if enough time goes by without any progress in AI, attitudes
will change.  If AI is eventually seen as impossible then these other
approaches may become more popular.

I'm not sure whether most AI reserachers have thought about this
choice, but I think monkey intelligence would be sufficient for the
vast majority of military and commercial applications imagined for AI,
and used to justify funding.  Lanaguage use might be the big
exception, but from what Greg Burch said, it may not even be that hard
to teach them language once they are domesticated.

Yes, but aren't these three facts a *consequence* of their not yet
being domesticated?

Concerning using primates for slaves, see big problems:

a) primates are very, very costly
b) primates are dangerous
c) primates are notoriously unreliable

A really cheap AI of a cockroach, or a bee equivalent is already extremely
Singularity-boosting, since being a breakthrough for navigation and
autonomous agents/robotics. Sad thing we apparently require molecular
circuitry for these. Even terminal WSI does not seem to suffice (not
cheap).

Sure they might work their way up the job ladder, but now they aren't
even on it, so that's where to focus initial attention.  Of course
most of us prefer free stuff to working, but the niche for that is
pretty small and fragile.  Apes should prefer to work for the same
reason we do, because that's the only realistic way they can grow and
thrive.

Monkeys are also able to learn language. Japanese researchers have
trained monkeys to read Japanese characters (and they're hard to learn).
They are also trying it vice versa: trying to learn the monkey
"language". An English researcher whose name I have forgotten asked a
monkey, I think it was a bonobo (they have the best learning
capabilities) to perform not so very simple tasks given to him in
English language ("fetch the ball out of the freezebox"), where the
conditions were not trained before (i. e., the ball had never been in
the freezebox before).

The problem is that apes are _physically_, not mentally, unable to
articulate language. When training them like someone who is deaf mute,
they can learn to "speak" using a complex sign language.

There's not as much research done in that area as one might expect. I
think it's mainly because of humans who don't want apes to become more
than uneducated animals. 
In Germany, there's the case of the ape "Freddy", a very interesting
one, where an ape who had never met any other apes thought that he was a
human. He behaved like one, too, and was very interested in contact with
other humans (and not in contact with other apes). But this ape was
"brainwashed", forced to return to his natural environment. Now that
he's back to normal everything is fine again. But this ape might have
been one of the best training objects they could ever get.

Not doing simple jobs should be the work of apes, for what motivation
should they have? If I was an ape, I would prefer getting my bananas for
free to having to brush the streets for them. Instead a continous
learning process for apes, including the use of computers and the
internet, could make humanity evolve into a multi-racial environment.
And the ape rights would also become a more important issue.

Most apes who were used for learning objects had much fun doing it. In
one project, they were given the choice to go to the "ape school"
whenever they wanted to, and most of them went the long way there every
day.

Maybe someone can give some literature about apes and projects with
them, the information above is from a TV documentation.

I'm not so sure that this is incorrect. If we're right that the human
brain can be uploaded to a computer, then what we see as consciousness is
merely a state in the machine; an emergent property of the network. If we
don't have souls then in some sense all consciousness *is* linked because
it's all the same process.

Not very wonderful at all, really. I'm still not sure of the full
implications of my theory above, but I certainly hope that it doesn't mean
that there's only one consciousness in the universe. That sounds pretty
dull to me.

Different types are currently being used in various projects, which
roughly break down into groups as: pure Ion drives, Plasma thruster, and
Arc-jet thruster. They vary in Isp and thrust between 600-3500 Isp and
.0001 lb up to 5 lb of thrust. These two vary inversely, so you can go
for "high" thrust, or high efficiency, but not both. The Air Force's
Phillips Labs is developing an interorbital tug that uses a thermal
solar electric generator and an Arc-Jet propulsion system. They hope to
have it up and operating by late 1998-99. This will allow 100 day
transfer times between LEO and Geosynch orbits at 1/10th of the cost of
a current chemical propelled upper stage. Each tug will have enough fuel
to do 10 missions before needing refueling. Current transfer costs range
from $10-20 million for a 10,000 lb payload.

Horses are useful.  Zebras are like horses.  Horses can't live in lots
of Africa, because of tsetse flies.  Most of Africa has known about
livestock; Diamond claims much Bantu livestock near the Sahel is
Eurasian in origin, which managed to trickle across the Sahara.  Bantu
farmers moving south left livestock behind because the livestock kept
dying.  Zebras would be useful.  But zebras are nasty; they don't let go
when they bite, and they duck lassos.  Zebras have not been domesticated.
In the past or by modern humans, who've tried again.

Neither have elephants; wild ones get tamed, at least in India, but they
haven't been bred and modified by humans.  And African elephants don't get
tamed.  Hannibal's were presumably African, but I think I've heard they
were an extinct breed.  (My reliability is deteriorating.)

Cheetahs have been tamed or domesticated as hunting cats.  Tigers and
lions haven't been.

Why did no North Americans become nomadic bison herders, like herders of
cattle, sheep, and goats in the Old World?

Proposal: most animals, for one reason or another, just aren't
domesticable.  Small mammals you can try breeding as you want anyway;
it's easy to play god to a gerbil or pigeon.  (I heard about Coast Guard
pigeons being used to rescue people years ago; I'd forgotten about it.
They peck a button when they see bright orange.  Source: 3-2-1 Contact a
long time ago.)  I don't know if there's any guarantee you'll succeed.
Or that it'll be economical for mortals to try.  If it takes 300 years
to breed an animal to a useful state, who's going to keep at it for that
long?  Knowing more about how dogs and horses got bred would be useful,
but presumably being useful and controllable in the wild state was
rather significant; after that maybe a royal breeder can start some long
term project.

I think I've heard the word "fragile" applied to great apes,
particularly in response to wounds or disease.  Wait five to ten years
for the gorilla to grow up, spend many years training it to do its job
*and* to interact safely with humans (gorilla might be smart enough to
figure out that it _is_ stronger than all the pale midgets around it)
and then it dies of the flu.  Or cold.  Nice profitable investment you
have here.

And what's a primate?  Curious, fairly intelligent, playful, and
manipulative.  And verbally autistic.  What's the market for dumb but
mischievous humans you can't talk to?  Monkeys may be too small to be
too useful, and the apes' generation time is too long.

I see no reason to assume an AI, human-level or not, would be as
intractable as most animals.  (Apart from the non-existence problem
right now.)  You can perhaps imitate the neural structure of nice
animals; you can have not built in nastiness in the first place; their
structure can be directly modified to see what happens, rather than just
breeding two animals with nice bloodlines and praying; and software AIs
running on SuperHexium or CAM-arrays can be even more easily modified,
or could be evolved at some speed.  And they shouldn't bite, shit, or
get sick.  (Brittleware has advantages Eugene: parasites can't spin out
and evolve so well.)

Max, In case you haven't yet seen this, Extropians are listed as a 
cult on several resources, including one web site and one print book. 
I didn't think much of it because I thought that someone had seen it, 
and I don't remember the name of the book now, but it's getting 
around. Some sort of directory of groups.

Open question, but, as I said, probably not.  Monkeys have evolved to
reproduce successfully in the wild for millions of years (billions in some
senses) and this has left them with many behaviors not well suited to
domesticated society.  AIs will not start with this disadvantage.

I would think that some self-motivation is important to intelligence.  But
even the most docile domesticated animal is pretty self-motivated.  Docility
is comparative.

As an aside, the domesticated primate (us) is the smartest primate of all.
 Domesticated animals by contrast tend to be dumber than their wild
relatives.  Apparently we prefer assistants as dumb as practical; this
preference may carry over to AIs.  The highly limited idiot savant-type AI
might well be the kind humans prefer to have about.  Of course, we want AIs
for thinking, while animals we generally want for other purposes.

No, even apes lack speech ability compared to us.  Even Koko only has a few
hundred words.  Apparently something in our brains, like our language centers
or our neocerebellum makes a big difference in our ability to speak.

Partly it's that we've tried and failed to replace humans with animals in the
routine but abstract purposes we're discussing here (cleaning, caretaking,
machine operation, etc.)  We have a new possibility so we're giving it a go.
 It's worth a try.

The other advantage to building the agents is that they might be far more
easily duplicated.  Monkeys are cheaper than people, but a well-trained
monkey still requires a lot of investment and upkeep.  Further, animals are
more variable than machines and that doesn't sit well with industrial design
theory, which works hard to minimize nonessential variability.

I see no evidence that any member of this list has been domesticated
in the sense in which nonhuman animals have occasionally been
domesticated by human animals.  I rather doubt that the experience
of being domesticated is an intelligence-enhancing experience.

If you want to talk about "domesticated primates" and the various
social effects and ramifications this has, I recommend studying
the history of human slavery.

(Unless, that is, we take up Tony Csoka's excellent suggestion and
begin discussing the economics of labor compensation for
nonhuman primates... but that might become too speculative for any
of us to be able to enjoyably suspend disbelief anymore.)

Coincidentally, I just this moment saw a TV commercial for a syndicated
program called Real TV.  Here in the L.A. area it will be on channel 11
(FOX) at, I think, 11 PM tonight (June 9). There will be a segment showing
a race between a man and a monkey to see which is faster picking coconuts.
This is not the same show I saw last year but it sounds like a similar
activity.

First a pet peeve:
1. Apes are not monkeys
2. Monkeys are not apes

Both are primates as are all members of genus homo along with lemurs,
lorises and tarsiers.
It's a big family tree and we are interested in evolution and the
technology used by at least some primates. Since I took my major in this
a lifetime ago please indulge me.

Let me throw out a few benchmarks. Homo and Pan (chimpanzees) shared
parents around 14 million years back (immunological  and fossil
evidence). It appears that our branch adopted a more aggressive approach
to technology. As most chimp tech is, by and large limited to sticks
there is no fossil record. We can assume that they were using it 10
million years ago or just for the last century with equal validity. H.
Australopithecus appears associated with "stone axes" or "tools"
(actually a rock broken into 2 or more pieces, according to the patent)
around 3 million years back, give or take. String and rope appear 20,000
BP.  (Just found that checking sources and it oddly corresponds to the
time frame when we first needed to make leashes and collars for Canus
associates). Canus Lupus appears to be the first victim of
domestication, which, as Eric Watt Forste points out is not always a
good thing for the domesticee.

Social organization of early H. Sapiens seems is closer to baboon troops
than chimps or gorillas but this is probably a parallel evolution
development given that baboons split off 2@10**6 BP.

Just 2 more points to inject :
The preponderance of  evidence is that H. Sapiens and H. Neanderthalis
are not distinct species making the correct names H. Sapiens Sapiens
(cro-magnon) and H. Sapiens Neanderthalis. Using the biological
definition of species (progeny of members of the set are able to
procreate, contrast donkeys and horses produce offspring, a mule that is
sterile). We are not significantly advanced from Neanderthals
(biologically).

Domestication does not always result in species. Canus Lupus can and do
breed with C. Familiaris and having owned one such creature (erroneously
referred to as hybrid ), I can assure you they are viable (and very
little like your usual dog). They are, as a matter of fact, costly,
dangerous and unreliable (not unpredictable).

Monkeys are small, cheap and terrably limited in their abilities, the
great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimps) are very delicate, expensive
and rare creatures. There is a surplus of available human labor.
"Owning" 90% of a wolf (10% dog) was very demanding emotionally. They
are not ment to be a possesion any more than another human. It really is
morally repugnant.

How is cult defined, anyway? A group sharing a common set of beliefs

By comparison with our hairier cousins, we have some signs typical of
domestication: lighter bones, variable loss of pigment and -- duh, I forgot.

Some claim we are inherently less bright than our hunter-gatherer
ancestors, making up for it with communication.

And, by the same definition, humans aren't apes.  But these definitions are
pretty arbitrary.  Apes certainly fall entirely within the monkey family, and
we fall within that of the apes.  In other words, apes are closer to some
monkeys than other monkeys are.  So calling an ape (or a human) a monkey
isn't really inaccurate, although there are valid reasons for drawing a
distinction.

All this timing business remain unsettled.  Conventional wisdom today,
however, says that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor only 3 million
years ago.

Well, perhaps not for the individual (depending on your definition).
 Domestication, however, is a spectacular success for the species.  There's a
lot more dogs than wolves today, and with some species (cats and sheep) the
ancestor species is nearly extinct.

The preponderance of evidence vis-a-vis that is simply missing.  We don't
have any Neanderthals to crossbreed with humans, so who knows if we could.
 For all we know, they might have had 48 chromosomes like other apes rather
than our 46 and crossbreeding would be quite out of the question.

Typical Neanderthals fell well outside of modern human norms in several
respects.  There larynxes were different and they probably couldn't speak as
well as us.  They had enormous nasal passages.  Their arms were put together
slightly differently and they would have been about twice as strong as us
(much as with the apes).  Conventional wisdom today is that they were
separate species both descended from Homo Heidelbergensis (sp?).  This is
pretty tentative conventional wisdom, though.

Speciation is a little more complicated than you put it.  There's also
species that could interbreed but don't, e.g., all the big cats.
 Homo/Neanderthal could have been that, too.

>We are not significantly advanced from Neanderthals

Not more advanced, but somewhat different.


>Domestication does not always result in species. 

I don't think it ever has, to date.  It could, if you bred the species for
differing sexual behaviour or genitalia.



>Monkeys are small, cheap and terrably limited in their abilities, 

Not *that* limited.  Quite capable of caretaking or machine operation, at
least in theory. Some mental abilities seem limited to apes, and some only to
humans.

>the

Expensive, yes.  Rare, yes (although if they were successfully domesticated
they'd become very common, like dogs, cats, parakeets, horses, etc)
 Delicate?  No more than any other large animal.

>There is a surplus of available human labor.

Really?  Could you give me some?  I never have enough.

Mebbe. You can always play "let's pretend there's me and you"--which is a philosophy with a long and motley heritage.

SPOILERS BELOW -- YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

















I actually spent a while thinking about how he was doing it all wrong.
Juan Chanson's attempt was documented near the end of the book (pgs.
534-536 of the Baen paperback).  He apparently:
a) didn't control the breeding of the monkeys
b) didn't even measure the monkeys' intelligence in any quantifiable way
   (speed at solving problems, number of different attempts to solve a
   particular problem, attention span, number of communication symbols
   learned, etc.)
c) taught the monkeys to do a particular task rather than how to solve
   problems
d) gave the monkeys no pro-cognition evolutionary pressures (I bet I could
   think up some very useful predators, given time) (or, say, I could try to
   get something as yummy to a monkey as a banana to grow inside something
   as hard as a coconut shell)
e) didn't even significantly control the environment of the monkeys
f - z) (and more) a whole _bunch_ of stuff I'd have an awfully long time
   to think of

Basically I convinced myself in short order that, given his resources,
there's no way I would have ended up in his sorry situation.  No surprise,
since _he_ was well on the way to being nuts when his ordeal started, and
had pretty much snapped before he even started his work on breeding an
intelligent species.

This is quite possible, but we don't really know it takes that long,
and new high tech might help speed things up.

Possibly.  But this sounds a lot

I doubt if we've tried anywhere near as hard to domesticate smart primates
as we've spent on A.I. research.

By "domestication" I meant getting the primates to understand and keep
the peace, so we needn't fear their presense.  To trade instead of
steal, etc.  I would very much want them to not be slaves, but to have
their own spaces, property, etc.

     Not to make a pun, but playing the "devil's advocate" here, I can draw 
     a few parallels to regular old existence that render the whimpy 
     regression archetype fairly innocuous.  
     
     First of all, I maintain that order and novelty seem to ongoingly 
     emerge across the millions of years of cosmic time.  Or at least 
     that's how it seems.  First there was nothing (or something we call 
     nothing), then basic elements and gases, crude matter, hot stars, 
     cooling planets, water, vegetation and microscopic organisms, fishes, 
     etc.. all the way to hefty brain-stemed HOMO SAPIEN (this one, BTW, 
     takes issue with all the flap about training apes for their 
     rudimentary service potential and agree that it is probably their 
     level of intelligence and curiosity that renders them slave-exempt).
     
     Anyway, so the ongoing evolution that we have theorized has brought us 
     to the threshold of human transcendence may just be one long 
     inhalation in cosmic time.  There are so many metaphors for cycle, the 
     on and off, the to and fro of things.  Granted, some of these cycles 
     may be so vast as to not warrant our attention.  But then that begs 
     the question as to why it's even necessary to spend an ounce of energy 
     despising myths or religious doctrines.  
     
     The only reason I know of is unresolved stuff from an oppressed 
     upbringing (mine was Southern Baptist but not ANAL WHACKO Southern 
     Baptist, just quaint and inconsistent Southern Baptist).  It certainly 
     did a number on me determining where/how I fit in and took a number of 
     years to figure out that sexuality choices do not equal an eternity in 
     some corner of the universe where I'm destined to suffer in pain.  
     Like I said, "quaint".
     
     Certainly, such cosmic cycles (if they exist at all) give extropian 
     thinking plenty of elbow room to expand into unimaginable creatures. 
     Still, I can't help but have some connection to the LILA myth since a 
     psychedlic trip I had several years ago.  In this dream state, I was 
     pulling away layers of space as if they were wallpaper.  I *knew* that 
     once I got to the last layer of space, all the answers would be on the 
     other side.  As I tore at what I were sure were the last layers of the 
     farthest regions of the known universe, I had tremendous anticipation. 
      I ripped away the final layer and whadaya know, ANOTHER UNIVERSE!  
     This is going to take an exhaustively long time I thought and I was 
     very disappointed.  At that point I asked myself (or was it 
     communicated to me), "why would you want to know all the answers, what 
     point would there be then?"  
     
     Frankly, thinking too much and too often makes me rather tired and 
     despondent.  That's why I perceive it important to keep balance, 
     breathe in and exhale out.  Quest then rest.  If the Universe is just 
     a big organic (?) diaphragm of cycling energy, then I'm okay with 
     that.  But I still get a little annoyed with the fundie that thinks my 
     "lifestyle" is going to make eternity a hot and unpleasant prospect.

I've long thought something like this might be good for cleaning up space
debris (the big stuff, obviously).  LEO is getting hazardous, and some people
think that in just a few decades there will be so much stuff up there that
there will be a kind of collision chain reaction catatrophe where debris
smashes other debris into smaller bits which in turn smash other debris until
LEO is full of screws and paint chips flying about at 8 klicks per second.
 If that happens, it's a couple hundred years before we can use LEO again and
even crossing LEO would involve meaningful hazard.  I understand that current
philosophy for LEO is to make sure jumk and debris falls back into the
atmosphere, but there's a lot of stuff up there already and in higher orbits
this isn't too practical.

If this is what you meant by domesticate, then your project sounds 
extremely ambitious to me, considering how many undomesticated members
of the primate species H. sapiens sapiens we still have to worry about.
(The Congress of the United States of America comes to mind.)

Of course, if we could easily escape from our undomesticated conspecifics
(space migration?), then your project might be a much more feasible one
than "traditional" AI, and I suspect that's your real point. But what
you're talking about is a tangly area, and thinking about it sets my
political-ethical thinking processes abuzz whether I like it or not.

To explain better, what I meant by "domestication" includes both what
you don't like, essentially slavery, and what you do, free economic
agents.  Either condition would be better for them than extinction.

*** U.S. researchers find enzyme affects aging process

Researchers said Monday they had found an enzyme that appeared to play
a role in the pace at which various organisms age and when they die.
Scientists said the enzyme is found in virtually all life forms and in
every tissue in the human body. Although it does not explain all of
the mysteries of aging, doctors said it could potentially be used in
developing treatments for certain age-related disorders like cataracts
and Alzheimer's Disease. The research was conducted at the University
of California at San Francisco. For the full text story, see

"In some sense", yes.  But I think, like you say, its an emergent
process; IOW: "Out of many, One".

Michael Butler wrote:

Like I quoted from Peat in the first post: "the animating power of the
world arises within movement of dualities."  And I think it was
Gregory Bateson who said: "it takes two somethings to make a
difference."  So, I prefer trinities (the Hegelian type, not the
Christian type ;-) to simple dualisms (see Ruckers _Mind Tools_), as
in there being three levels to reality: content, context and contest,
each of which is distinct from, but relies on, the others.  Put
another way, we have agents, environments and interactions (contests
between them); and, you cant have any one of these pieces without the
other.  So, everything is certainly linked as Mark says; but, that
doesnt mean its not necessary to distinguish between them.

Funny, I was just reading Mark Miller & Eric Drexlers (1988) "Markets
and Computation: Agoric Open Systems"
(http://www.agorics.com/agorics/agoricsPapers/aos/AOS0.html) this
morning, and what they say about objects seems relevant to the point
Im trying to make: 

<Encapsulation of information ensures that one object cannot directly
read or tamper with the contents of another; communication enables
objects to exchange information by mutual consent. The encapsulation
and communication of access ensures that communication rights are
similarly controlled and transferable only by mutual consent.  [SNIP] 

The command model has frequently been considered more "rational",
since it involves the visible application of reason to the economic
problem as a whole. Alternatives have frequently been considered
irrational and an invitation to chaos. This viewpoint, however, smacks
of the creationist fallacy - it assumes that a coherent result
requires a guiding plan. In actuality, decentralized planning is
potentially more rational, since it involves more minds taking into
account more total information. [SNIP]

To combat this problem, modern object-oriented programming (to
paraphrase [Hayek]) "secures to each object a known space within which
it can decide on its actions, enabling the programmer to make the
fullest use of his knowledge. Encapsulation tells him what facts he
may count on and thereby extends the range within which he can predict
the consequences of his actions". In short, motivated by the need for
decentralized planning and division of labor, computer science has
reinvented the notion of property rights.>

This is why I think we need many individuals and selves, rather than
some Great Borganism, in order to create an extropian multiverse
rather than an entropian universe headed for collapse.

I said: This [LILA model] sounds no different to me from the Christian
Apocalypse & Resurrection.

And Michael noted:
<As G. Spencer Brown said, the symbol = may be taken to mean "is
confused with".>

I mistakenly posted an earlier version of what I wrote (working on
multiple systems can be confusing ;-).  My final version of that
statement said: This sounds to me too much like the Christian Original
Sin, Apocalypse and Resurrection.

My point about these "New Age" notions of unity (particularly LILA) is
that, instead of "Out of Many, One", they want to say, "Out of One,
Many; SO, back to One".  This is a Big Bang to Big Crunch scenario
and, IMHO, it is Creationist; and, this yearning to "return to the
One" is a desire to dissolve into the primal soup, an abdication of
individual responsibility for carrying on the creation.

I havent read G. Spenser-Brown, but I did take these notes from F.
David Peats discussion of him in _Synchronicity_:

< Next, Peat's explores "the work of the logician and mathematician
G.Spenser-Brown ... a rather enigmatic figure who first came to the
attention of the aging Bertrand Russell in 1965.... 'Laws of Form'
takes as its origin a basic act of distinction ... once an active
observer or a creative act of perception, is admitted into this void,
then it becomes possible to draw the first distinction ... [which]
allows a movement to begin ... A particularly interesting feature of
this logic is that it is capable of generating expressions that begin
to refer to themselves ... Spenser-Brown's re-entrant forms are in
fact self-generating expressions that are capable of perpetuating
themselves indefinitely." Peat goes on to explain the importance of
context to this Hegelian dialectic; but, he imparts too much
significance to the initial creative 'big bang' and not enough to the
ongoing adaptive process that is thus generated.

02/11/96. And so, as "Synchronicity" wraps up, Peat curls himself into
a sort of fetal position, seeking to return to the womb in a sense, by
emphasizing the origin, "the pure, unconditioned perception," what he
and the mystics call "the stillness", rather than the 'noisy', ongoing
"creative unfolding ... able to respond to an ever-changing context." >

Mark Crosby

P.S. re Rick Knight's latest response (read after writing the above):

<Frankly, thinking too much and too often makes me rather tired and 
despondent.  That's why I perceive it important to keep balance,
breathe in and exhale out.  Quest then rest.>

Nothing wrong with that! That's just balance between Being and
Becoming.  (I don't mean to be a "rigid fundie" about any of this ;-)

I can't resist one more excerpt from my notes that addresses this:

<[Peat] confuses Being and Becoming: "The major barriers to a creative
transformation of consciousness are the attachments of the self, which
give rise to the mechanical order of becoming in which the more subtle
and faster movements of nature are lost." This is backwards! Being is
mechanical and static [or, at least, restful and neutral ;-] .
Becoming is creative and dynamic. [snip] In lamenting the
fragmentation of science, the alienation of the individual and the
decay of civility, he sets up myths that are only true from a limited
perspective that is preoccupied with the present. His "better notion
of an intense and vibrant stillness" is little different from the
fashionable notion of "holism" he decries which "suggests a self that
becomes immersed in a warm bath of mindless gravy."  

In the end though, it is merely a matter of semantics and taste that
distinguishes my view from Peat's because he concludes: "Eternity does
not exist outside the self ... to die to the self does not mean to
sacrifice all identity or freedom of action in the explicate world.
Rather it suggests a dying of attachments to rigid, fixed forms and an
unfolding of sequential time into its wider [fractal] order.... So the
dissolution of fragmentation does not imply the abandonment of all
distinctions and categories; rather, it suggests that distinctions are
constantly being created, modified and ended in harmony with the
general movement of reality." If that is not a description of eternal
Becoming rather than the static Being of the mystic then I must have
my meanings plugged in wrong!>

Well, I'm looking at a chart in "The Prehistory of the Mind" by Mithen (p
199), that shows Old World Monkeys and Apes both descended from a species
called Aegyptopithecus, from which New World Monkeys are *not* descended.
If this is right, then 'monkey' is either not a monophyletic group, or all
apes are monkeys.

I think we do know it takes that long, if not many times longer.  All the
really useful domesticated species I know of have been the object of
deliberate breeding for at least five hundred years.  This includes cows,
sheep, dogs, horses, cats, chickens, llamas, vicunas, ducks, rabbits, geese
and guinea pigs.  Two cases where I might be wrong are carp, turkeys and
ostriches.  Does anyone know how long ago people began to breed carp and
turkeys?  I know ostrich farming was well-established a century ago, so if
significant domestication has occured since then, that might indicate that
it can be done in that short a time.

Whoops!  Just thought of a counterexample to my own claim: lab rats and
white mice have both been domesticated in the last century.  Of course, both
these species have very short generation times.  So I think I can revise my
claim to the following: no species has been domesticated in less than 500
generations.  Here my definition of 'domesticated' is that I would walk
through a paddock occupied by several of them, that I didn't know
personally, without being worried.  Thus, honeybees, bison, and elephants
are not domesticated.

They are all chordates too. The disinction I am making can be easily
seen in brain mass alone which varies over an order of magnitude between
small monkeys and h. sapiens.

More formally:
Humans are classified as follows: Kingdom Animalae, Phylum Chordata,
(Subphylum Vertebrata),Class Mammalia, Order Primate, Family Homonid,
Genus Homo, Species Sapiens, (Subspecies Sapiens).New World monkeys
belong to Family Cebidae, Old World Monkeys to Family Cercopithecidae,
Family Hylobatidae covers Gibbons and lesser apes.

Members of genus Homo belong to Family Hominidae which, in addition
includes the genera Gorilla, Pan and Pongo, all of which are listed as
endangered with the exception of some species of Pan in captivity where
they are classified Vulnerable.

I see... more is always better.To anthropomorphize a bit, you would
rather be a chattel than a free being? If the domestication arrangement
between "higher" and "lower" species (as determined by YOU) I assume you
would welcome the arrangement should you encounter a more "advanced"
being (as determined by them).

I will respond to the rest of your questions off-line.

The 'them' in your last sentence refers to the species as a collective.
Consider what the extinction/employment choice looks like to an individual
ape: a risky life in the wild, leading perhaps to producing less than two
offspring, versus life in a factory assembling toilet brushes.  Any
reasonable ape would prefer the former.  Since I don't believe in oppresing
individuals for the good of the species, I don't think your argument has
moral force.

On the other hand, I don't extend the full spectrum of human rights to
nonhuman apes, so if you want to oppress apes, it's probably OK by me.  Just
don't argue that it's for their own good.

Again, you may be right, but this seems to be just speculation.  We
don't know how long it took to reach your (reasonable) definition of
domestication, nor how many individuals (both humans and others) were
involved in the effort.  I understand that "scientific" breeding in
modern farms has improved greatly over older intuitive breeding.  And
it stands to reason that great further improvements will be possible
when we can cheaply read out the entire genome of each individual in a
breeding program, match them with detailed behavioral data, and
even splice together desired trial genomes.

I don't that there would be any fewer niches for wild primates if
there were also domesticated primates.  Considering equilibrium
distributions, the choice is between enslaved primates and primates
who don't exist at all.  You might however object regarding the
individuals selected for the domestication program, depending on how
they were treated initially.

Perhaps this species of monkey lives by eating fruit from trees.  In that
case, this task would be very close to its evolved capacities.  From the
monkey's point of view, it has trained a human to open coconuts for it.

That sounds like a redefinition of the term "smart" to me. Both sonar
processing is highly nontrivial, and I think somebody (Dawkins?) has once
mentioned their cortex being of a more ancient, primitive makeup than even
ours is. Besides, we are threatening them beasties, not them us, and them
Stoics seem not to do much about it. "... and thanks for all the fish"?

Hmm, so the strongest animals are the insects since they have the
largest strength to body mass ratio? I wouldn't trust a simple ratio
to determine intelligence, the scaling of sensory and motor cortex is
far from linear. Intelligence (however defined) is a property of
behavior rather than the body (which produces behavior).

And Florida manatees have a very low brain to body ration, yet they're far
from stupid.  Manatees just evolved from smaller rodents, and their brain
didn't scale with their body.
If you compare two people with equally-sized brains, will the smaller
person be smarter?

Hi!

I would like to know your opinion about why are we allowed to age? Why,
after millions of years of evolution, we still age?

Following the darwinist concept of evolution, surely a trait that would
allow one individual to live longer than the others would be favoured.
Indiduals with these trait would produce more offspring and therefore
the trait would soon be present in the general population. This,
however, doesn't happen with humans neither (as far as I know) other
mammals. If, there are species capable of such intellectual skills (such
as us) and many other species with amazing skills, why hasn't a
non-aging process evolved in many more species that it did?

I'm pratically new to this mailing list so I hope I get some answers.

             Hasta la vista...

You've reminded me of an auxilary concern here.  Last year, in 
addition to crashing Julf's remailer, the Scientologists drove the

people call CAN to see if their kid is mixed up with a cult, they get 
a Scientologist on the line and who knows what kind of 'information'.

If it weren't for modern medicine, evolution would be a bit more
effective. Since we no longer let the "bad genes" die off, they don't go
away.

I jest, but seriously, does anyone know the names of the sources mentioned
earlier listing Extropians as a cult?  WOuld it do any good to contact
these people and tell them they're wrong, at least as far as the popular
connotaion of "cult" goes?  Or would that be percieved  like Scientologists

Are there any laws banning "cult" activities?  Should Extropians beware,
or I am just paraniod?

I'm not a real biologist and I don't even play one on TV, but our
genes don't give a damn if we age, as long as *they* keep going.
>From the gene's point of view, the biological struggle between the
generations is very real, and once Mom and Pop have done a good
job of getting the tyrannical little genes into young Boomer, then
as far as the gene is concerned, goodbye Mom and Pop! Especially
if they're competing with young Boomer for foraging territory.

The gene follows John K. Clark's theory of identity to a tee: one
copy is as good as any other, and a copy in a young hale-and-hearty
organism is a better bet for immortality than the copies in Mom
and Pop.

(I shouldn't cite John K. Clark's theory of identity when explaining
something to someone new to the list, but I'm sure he'll be happy
to elucidate. Chalk it up to my intellectual orneriness.)

Not really.  There were a couple of references years ago, but it was used by
the writers for a writing flare to grab attention,  rather than term of used

You have an exclamation point at the end of your example sentence.  It's the
exclamation that looks and sounds defensive.  When corrections are made they
need not come off as a freak-out or defense, but a comment of what is
accurate or not.

>Are there any laws banning "cult" activities?  Should Extropians beware,

I don't think we have anything to worry about as long as extropians don't
refer to themselves as a cult.  I haven't seen that happen, because it is
not a cult.  So if other people place inappropriate labels on us from time
to time, the best thing is to act calmly and clear the misconception.

Sure; you can define humans either as monkeys with very big and altered
brains or as non-monkeys with a very long list of monkey-specific
biochemistry, behaviour, and anatomy.  It's entirely up to you and both
definitions are meaningful.  From a genetic point of view we're just another
monkey, with no more genetic changes that any other monkey.  From a
behavioral point of view we are very different, with most of the difference
coming from the very slight genetic differences between us and chimpanzees.
 If you look at our effects on the earth, at this point we virtually deserve
our own kingdom.

Not quite always.  But, as I said, from the *species* point of view more in
this fashion is very good.

>To anthropomorphize a bit, you would

Free, of course, but that's not the option here.  The "choice" for these
species may well be extinction or domestication as pets/slaves (of course,
insofar as a choice is being made, it's ours).  Mountain gorillas, for
example, are down to about 500 individuals with a demanding habitat
requirement.  In spite of being protected, if they aren't domesticated,
between poachers, natural disasters, and the occaisional war they will
probably soon be gone.

Also, don't forget that monkeys and apes generally live in societies too.
 From what I know about ape society, I think I'd rather be a pet in a human
one.  Ape societies can be quite brutal.  I assume monkeys can as well.

Brain-to-body is a good way of estimating intelligence; but it probably isn't
the whole story.  I'd think that if dolphins were smarter than us they'd
evade fishing nets better.  I could be wrong.  It could well be that dolphins
are (and Neanderthals were) smarter than us but we do better because we're
better platforms for memetic replication.

To quibble, I said human were the smartest *primate* and dolphins aren't a
counterexample to that.  However, I believe Neanderthals also had a higher
brain-to-body than we do.

Looking into the future as a follow up to Mark's interesting point, which is
also discussed in Wired October 1994 issue, how and through what medium would
the Extropians go about uploading our human brains to say a Web site on the
Internet-- in mere bit/byte PET Scans mappings, or actual cryonic DNA through
molecular computing or nanotechnology as some Extropians propose?

For sake of argument, if Mark is corrrect that "...consciousness is a state
in the machine; an emergent property of the network...", and assuming that
every Internet user uploaded their brain's DNA, would that result in a
"Collective Extrophic Consciousness" or "Collective cyber/molecular brain
mass"  as such, beyond our mere brains per se?  

Or, is it possible that our "Collective Consciousness" is beyond something
material and genetic-- the spiritual, the eternal, yes the soul--
apocryphally speaking?  Would that mean there may be the after-life beyond
this physical world?

The trait would be advantageous *only* if it carried no disadvantages.  The
general idea is that almost every mutation that come up for humans that would
extend life carries some disadvantage - stricter dietary requirement, delayed
puberty, greater chance of death by disease, etc.  Those that help, we do
have, and that's why we live decades rather than minutes.

It may also be that extended life is a disadvantage in and of itself by
slowing adaption to parasites and diseases.

	I'm no fan of the Christian meme but I don't think your
connection is quite right.  Almost any religion sounds like the "new age"
idea, and some quite a bit more than Christianity.  In fact it is a heresy
to consider yourself a minute portion of the one, the all, God etc.  It
actually sounds more like the Omega point theory which some extropian
minded people put some stock in.

	Domestication is not necessarily more difficult than creating AI,
in fact since AI doesnt't yet exist it is infinitely easier but that does
not make it necessarily desirable.  I may be saying this to the wrong
crowd but I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of evolving other
organisms, especially since I'm 98% chimp myself.  For me part of the
whole push to become boundless is to do it on my own or with the help of a
few like minded people.  I'll let Homo sapiens sapiens and the rest of the
DNA gang let random evolution and maybe a little complexity theory shape
them over the eons while move on to bigger, better and transsapien things.

I'm not worried about Microsoft's "monopoly", but I've disliked their
products since the middle 1980s. Nowadays it looks as if the only
viable alternative is presented by the free software movement.

	http://www.gnu.org/
	http://www.debian.org/
	http://www.gnustep.org/
	http://www.freebsd.org/
	http://www.linux.org/

And others. In addition to Linux and Stallman's various Gnu projects,
there are now (I think) three or four actively developed and
supported unencumbered versions of BSD Unix out there (I've only
listed FreeBSD above, but seek and ye shall find).

As for myself, I've found Lee Daniel Crocker's arguments presented
on this list against any "right" to prevent people from sharing
copies of information they have (which is a general enough idea
to include all software) very convincing, so even if I loved 
Microsoft's products, I still might not want to use them anymore.

Certain things are only possible if distinctions are drawn; certain things are only possible if distinctions are *not* drawn. 


Sorry if that sounds mysterious or too rubbery.

There are two other salient points I want to make: there is a presumption that a central plan must be "correct" or "perfectible", and an underlying  epistemological ground that there is such a thing as the one correct set of categories, and all one has to do is find them and force the universe to fit. :) (this observation after Lakoff, of course.)

Looks like I made a liar of myself re: only having time for 2 points. :) Yeah, advocacy of permanent return-to-the-womb is kind of dumb, but it seems clear you're doing the dissection I asked you to do; I was just worried that you were ignoring the positive aspects of samadhi as a choice. Being stuck there is like being stuck anywhere. :) :)

	Succinctly put.  All power to the replicators!  Actually that
brings up an interesting point.  Extropianism is in many ways us versus
the current set of replicators.  Human nature often battles DNA and
transhumans will do so even more.  In fact Graham Cairns-Smith proposes
that DNA is in fact a replicator that defeated an earlier more primitive
replicator and that all those arguments about how unlikely it is for life
to have started are unneccessary as a more simple form than now exists
existed before.

Gee, that's in the ball park but...
Leaving aside the question of personifying genes, which in truth don't
give a damn about anything, I do think you are coloring them a bit
harshly.  There is some advantage to the gene in keeping mom and pop
alive, especially as long as they can breed with fidelity, it just 
isn't a strong enough advantage to change the genes quickly. Most of 
human evolution took place when old age was not a common cause of death 
so it really did not help a lot to have a long natural life span.  It's
not so much that genes don't want old folks around as that it's just
not high on their priority list.

To pursue this question seriously I would suggest Michael Rose's work
selectively breading fruit flies for longevity, Caleb Finch's 
_Longevity, Senescence and the Genome_, and a good book on the
mathematics of evolution.  I have spent a little time with each of
these but not enough to really answer Joao's question.

You're changing question in mid-stream.  Genome matching might be
usefully feasible now, or in ten years; it hasn't exactly been around
for anyone trying to domesticate nasty animals in the past.  Considering
the 5-10 year generation time for apes, and their low utility and high
danger to begin with, it seems very plausible to me that it was never
economical to domesticate them.  "We don't know how long it takes"?
Perhaps, but I think believing an agressive species could be noticeably
domesticated in less than 10 generations is like John Clark's claim that
godhood will be feasible seconds after the first nano-assembler.  And 10
generations for an ape is the better part of a century.  And I suspect
it would take more generations... you need to be improving docility and
immunity and utility simultaneously.  You might be able to get a few
docile animals quickly, but the gene pool will be small.  If you try to
get a pool of animals who don't get sick too easily outside of their
natural environment, you're spending a lot of time on agressive,
non-useful (low-return) animals.  I don't buy it.

The fact that 21st century gengineers could produce a domesticated zebra
doesn't change the lack of success modern "scientific" breeders have had
so far, or the lack of success anyone had in the past -- when it would
have been rather more useful!

Why?  Why should an AI be hard to "domesticate"?  There are evolutionary
reasons for lots of the factors behind an animal being too vicious or
panicky or territorial; there'd be no reason for AIs to have these
traits.  I think a major predator of chimps is other chimps, as with
humans; AIs won't have evolved any defensive or offensive strategies.

And about breeding you write

} it stands to reason that great further improvements will be possible
} when we can cheaply read out the entire genome of each individual in a
} breeding program, match them with detailed behavioral data, and
} even splice together desired trial genomes.

It stands to reason that all of these abilities apply naturally to AIs with
no less ease, and for some versions far more ease, than to animals.

} I doubt if we've tried anywhere near as hard to domesticate smart primates
} as we've spent on A.I. research. 
 
Is it really rational to spend as much on primate domestication as on AI
research?  Yes, they're farther along, but they're still rather not
ideal, and they're hard to work with.  Not all that many to work with,
for one thing.  AI has a long road, but seems able to move very quickly.
At least once it finds the road.

As for hypothetical primate compensation... you pay your labor force
what it takes to get them to work, not what you think is fair.  Unless
they get seriously uplifted they won't be taking greenbacks; they'd just
try to eat them.  Bananas.  Access to females.  Not getting beaten.  Or
being bred to a state where they just love to serve us, like dogs.

Now, how about AI compensation?  Why should we treat an AI as a citizen
if it doesn't ask to be treated as a citizen?  If it's perfectly happy to
fulfill my every wish, to pilot its fighter-body in a kamikaze attack as
enthusiastically as any glory-seeking adolescent male?

Ethics of designing an AI that way are left up to other debatants.

That might explain why kids kill their parents (they do?), but doesn't seem
to address JP's question.  After all, it takes Boomer somewhere between 12
and 30 years to pop out Boomer Jr, but Mum and Dad are still in there
replicating like fiends, once a year and sometimes twins.  If they stayed
fertile, Myrtle, they'd always be ahead of the game.

The real answers are going to involve complex interactions and costs.
Beating the critters that feast inside humans is surely one key to this -
sex as immunological remixing to stay Red Queened.  And childhood enhancers
that just happen to involve deferred costs and luckless synergisms.  I've
always assumed that since the germ line is passed straight down from the
year dot, with mutations but no senescence, the DNA-cleanup equipment used
to keep its shoes shined must be way too expensive to mass-produce for the
grunts, even the smart guys in the CNS.

Randolph Nesse and George Williams discuss this stuff in their recent book
on darwinian medicine (EVOLUTION AND HEALING in the UK, something else in
the USA), but wimp out at the crucial points - presumably because it's too
soon to say anything really informed.

Your's is the third message I've recieved today about it. It is a
Netscape Communicator extension, naturally it is not handled well by
many (most?) mail clients.

I actually came accross a post on the list from someone at a-albonic
who's post came accross with a complete name & address card (apparently
this only occurs with Netscape Messenger), I tried to implement it in a
sig file and was changing my profile when I discovered the option and
turned it on.

I recieved mail from oz on this matter at 4:00 AM this morning, it
amazes me that I can annoy people 10,000 miles away with a simple check
box. Better Living through Technology.

Sincere apologies,
-Nick Nicholas

I use Claris Emailer 2.0 on my Mac, and with that the vcard.vcf file just 
shows up as an attachment which appears on my desktop.

I'd bet that that person was James Daugherty, right?  I was meaning to 
send him a message about this as well.

Sounds interesting, though.  Does the card show up in a frame in the 
Netscape window?

No big deal.  I just happened to have a few minutes and thought I'd give 
you a heads-up.  Now we're both a little wiser, so it worked out well, 
right?

1998 Special Issue of Neural Networks

NEURAL CONTROL AND ROBOTICS: BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY


Planning and executing movements is of great importance in
both biological and mechanical systems. This Special Issue will
bring together a broad range of invited and contributed articles
that describe progress in understanding the biology and technology
of movement control. Movement control covers a wide range of topics,
from integration of different types of sensory information, to
flexible planning of movements, to generation of motor commands, to
compensation for internal and external perturbations. Of particular
importance are the coordinate transformations, memory systems, and
attentional and volitional mechanisms needed to implement movement
control. Neural control is the study of how biological systems have
solved these problems with joints, muscles, and brains. Robotics is
the attempt to build mechanical systems that can solve these problems
under constraints of size, weight, robustness, and cost. This Special
Issue welcomes high quality articles from both fields and seeks to
explore the possible synergies between them.

You're right, there are two questions: why haven't people tried very

I started this whole thread by describing existing lab monkeys, who
are smart enough, less threatening than wild monkeys, and don't get
sick that easily.  We are already part of the way there.

We don't know what sort of evolutionary environment will be successful
in producing AIs.  I do hope you're right that a non-competitive
environment will be sufficient, but we don't know.

>AI has a long road, but seems able to move very quickly.  At least

What indications do we have that AI can move quickly?  I admit its a
logical possibility, but beyond that what do we know?

Why?  What use would they have?  If we treat them just like people they wont
make our lives any easier, they'll just take up space.  You could give them
the jobs people don't like to do, but that's as good as slavery!  Best left

English internet magazine .net featured extropians in an article called 'net
cults'.  However, they did start by saying "These guys are completely
different to other internet cults" and ended with "It's scientific,
rigorously logical, and nerdish - in other words, a world apart from the
spiritualists and cyberprophets inhabiting the fringes of the Net."

So, when's the next comet !?

Surely simulating DNA would not have any advantage over real DNA (would the
system used to simulate it be smaller than the DNA itself?)  This is one of
the things that I never understand about uploading, what advantage does it
offer?

If I wanted to simulate myself, how much of me would I need to simulate?
 Just the brain paterns? or would I have to simulate everything?  Surely if I
simulate something in every possible detail, the simulation would be larger
and slower than the original.  Would my uploaded self be free from the
effects of time, or does information have to represented by something
physical? (and could we represent it by something more efficient than the
original?)

All information describes something physical, therefore the physical object
takes less space than the description (when the description is of
*everything* concerning the physical object, and the information has to be
represented by something physical).  Existing as pure information would be
less efficient than existing as the thing we create information about.

The advantage that it offers is that possibly your new platform won't
have a designed-in mean time between failures of less than 120 years.

My response:

This is a potentially loaded statement and I'd like some clarification on 
it as well as pose a question.

Are human rights exclusive to humans because we have the power to invent 
and enforce them (as opposed to apes/gorillas and other creatures which we 
have established do not)?  

I continue to marvel at the mileage this "Planet of the Apes" thread seems 
to have.  Perhaps it touches down in a territory of undecided or 
questionable ethics that make the more-evolved mind uncomfortable because 
of the potential conflict of interests or duality represented by the notion 
of enslaving creatures (we enslave the smart ones, we eat the dumb ones).

It would also seem to me that the mechanism of evolution -
mutation->adaption->normalization   could be short-circuited by extreme
longevity or immortality.  Swift turnover and ability to issue offspring
that may be more suited to a changing condition are probably evolutionary
positives....

Not that I'm wild about it as an individual....

There are two different human species in this conversation. One of
them is an ape gene pool. The other one is six billion people,
acculturated in a variety of ways, who are participating in a
culture and an economy that has global ramifications, many of which
support and enrich my life.

I don't really care much about the first human species in the
abstract. I care rather intensely about the second one. Of course,
they are one and the same, since this is a strictly conceptual
dichotomy, not a material dichotomy. But bear with me.

The fact that senescence might just possibly be in the best interests
of the first human species impresses me not much. The fact that
senescence kills people off mere decades after they begin to get
the knack of enjoyably participating in the second human species
bugs me.  To put it mildly.

The subject line for this thread is something of a joke. Last I
checked, there was no pilot for the cosmos, no architect who designed
us. No one to allow or disallow anything, save for us wildlife. If
I anthropomorphized genes, it was to emphasize that no one *else*
has been in charge of bringing about our current situation, in
which we find our bodies riddled with junk genes that unleash
cancers after several decades, genes which were the result of random
cosmic ray strikes and then, according to the Medawar theory of
senescence (which I favor) simply never got selected out of the
gene pool because they had no effect on reproductive success. So
we age and die.

At least until we do something to change that.

Until we have ruled out the possibility of molecular nanotechnology
(and we haven't even gotten close to ruling out that possibility
yet), it seems to me developing this technology would offer the
shortest path to being able to do the extremely gnarly gene therapy
we're going to need to remove or suppress the junk in our genomes
that kills us. This year it looks like software development is one
route toward molecular nanotechnology that might help, so I'm
working on acquiring skills in that area, and I'm also trying to
bone up on some of the chemistry I've already studied and some of
the engineering I've never studied before.

If molecular nanotech doesn't pan out, perhaps I'll return to my
original undergrad field, biochemistry, and see what I can do with
that.

(It could be that I am distracted from molecular biology proper
toward molecular nanotechnology because the latter is also a possible
shortcut toward the development of the resources of outer space,
which is another of my interests. Chess players and go players
alike find forking attacks seductive.)

	And the ability to spontaneously install things like doctorate
degrees and/or life time memories such as practicing the piano for a
life time or studying math for a life time...  And the ability to
spontaneously do things like change habits or rewire temptations,
(i.e. get the joy from NOT eating that extra unneeded piece of cheese
cake rather than only getting the joy from eating it).  And the
ability to eff feelings (i.e. experience all the sexual feelings
between two partners, not just half of them.)  And the ability to
experience things you never experienced before (i.e. what is it like
to be a bat)...  and the ability to install upgradeds new/improved
intelligence technology abilities as they become available... and on
and on and on without limit until one is finally God.  Even if one
makes his brain immortal, you can't get very far if you limit yourself
to the current brain you have can you?

	By the way, this is my first post to this list.  I only have a
BS in CS from the University of Utah and work as a Software Engineer
for HP but I'm also %100 extropian!

	The "advanced" being may think it is more advanced.  Human beings have
also thought they were more advanced than others (and in some cases they
were, technologically).  African (or South American? both? I forget.
source, recent Discover magazine) tribes often give themselves names that
can be translated roughly to "the most human."  The tribes do not
systematically enslave each other because they cannot.  They may define
themselves as better but they are not more powerful, and that is what it
comes down to.  Europeans saw themselves as better than others and they had
the technology to enforce this view, although often not without a fight.  I
doubt any advanced intelligence would have any use for us, as they would
probably have developed nanotech in which case the most use they would find
for us is the matter in our bodies.  If they somehow managed to take to the
stars without nanotech and wanted to enslave us you can be sure that it
would be costly (and if it wasn't they would not have to take slaves).

Engines of Creation suggests a likely route to nanotech by way of
biochemistry. That is, engineering protein "machines" to put non-organic
molecules together.

	In some cases, things that help the individual in early life hurt the
individual in later life.  For instance, there is some evidence that cells
are limited to a certain number of replications.  This could be a safe
guard against cancer.  Of course, once we have aged and reached that number
of replications naturally we may have problems.  But by that time we have
probably had children and, in most of human history and maybe today, we
have died of something else.

	I would not worry about it.  Most of the cult activities that people worry
about are illegal anyway (like psychedelic drug use, hey wait a second...
:>).  Others are quite stupid and rather opposed to Extropian ideas.  Of
course, the word "cult" most likely would inspire some people to suspend
all rational judgment, so they might not realize that uploading is a means,
not an end, never mind more subtle things (anarcho-capatilism for one).  
	We have a long way to go before we reach the level of cult that the
Catholic church has reached.  Of course, we have a long way to go before we
reach their level of political pull as well (at which point everyone would
start losing political pull, anarcho-capatilism forever!).

	I had heard of an attempt to domesticate a certain type of fox (silver?)
because its fur was so highly prized.  The process used was to breed the
animals that tolerated the shortest distance between them and a human being
before running.  They were domesticated, in that they were friendly to
people.  The problem is domesticity and coat color were linked so the
project turned out a useless result.  I would guess that this is a result
of keeping the fox in a semi-juvenile stage.  The same was done in the
domestication of wolves.

Potential immortality, back up copies.  But the real advantage would be
the ease with which you could change yourself.  In other words, if you
uplaod, you won't stay mere simulation of the human you used to be.

How exactly do you think we will do that as uploads? It's not obvious that
a change of platform will instantly make us totally malleable or give us
the ability easily to simply plug in new abilities. I'm not saying it can't
happen, but I do think this assumption is usually made without argument.

I'd be interested in how you would support these claims.

Show me a set of enzymes capable of building a cage just three atoms 
across, and I'll believe that. Enzymes can't build nor break down 
diamandoids, and the bigger the cages are, the harder it gets.

The only way to design a protein is the darwinian one, either in vitro, or
in machina. The hard part is which sequence is right, after that it is 
plain sailing, routine work for a graduate student. As far I can see, 
a bioscientist taking up molecular modelling is making a great 
contribution to the art of molecular manufacturing. Should machine-phase 
chemistry be unattainable, we'd still have protein-based molecular 
circuitry, and wet autoreplicators. A very substantial second prize, imo.

ciao,
'gene

P.S. Conc. the original subject: each species as a whole has an optimal
individuum life time, where adaptation rate is at the maximum (no, this is
not a definition). After some primates had experienced a memetic takeover,
a gross disequilibrium in relation to lifetime had occured. Do not forget
that we already get exceptionally old, whether as a primate, or a mammal. 
The new thing with us, we might be able to abandon discontinous Darwin for
the continous Lamarck quite soon, with added extras like rational design.
(Darwin is still firmly with us, though. You can't get rid of him.) No
event like that has ever happened on this planet.

Agreed.

If ability is a matter of information, then as an upload, no known
ability is out of reach. However, it seems unlikely to me (stick neck
out) that an ability arises out of a mere confluence of data. Skills
like playing the piano don't seem to arise out of your knowledge of
music since an eye-hand motor skill is involved. Similarly, while a
doctorate degree may be conferred along with the corresponding
informational foundation, the ability to synthesize the data is a
product of training in the particular field. I wonder if
"hunch-tendency" is even a separate and correspndingly programmable
trait?

At the very least, despite the fact that mere information may not confer
actual ability, a database of all human kowledge accessible by an upload
at speeds beyond any we might fathom is definitely an advantage -- all
with perfect recall, and all at the burst of a thought. 

It sure beats studying.

Actually, as soon as an individual has reproduced the length of its
life doesn't matter much (for evolution, that is), although there
might be some competition between old and young. 

I think it was Sir Medawar who suggested that we live long enough to
take care of our offspring, plus some extra time due to the built in
redundancy in our system. Living shorter than that would be a
disadvantage (you die before reproducing), living longer would be a
slight disadvantage (competition of resources) but due to the extreme
danger of life in the natural world this is rarely important. Note
that this view suggest that ageing is a gradual breakdown of our
systems simply because they were not designed to last indefinitely,
just long enough. Some species (like pacific salmon) even have
planned obsolescence.

If you're going to answer your own questions...

Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you
understand it.  When applied to living organisms, it's quite
clear that immoratility serves no purpose to a gene's survival,
and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once's you're done
reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further
replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.
Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),
not organisms.

Adding new skills and memories would be nontrivial even if we could
modify the neurons of the brain at will. Memories are stored in a
distributed fashion, most likely as the synaptic strengths of widely
interconnected neural networks in the cortex. This means that the
memories of practicing and playing the piano are very hard to
untangle from (say) the memories of the piano teacher, childhood
memories, the experience of first using a computer and a lot of other
stuff. 

Moving a skill from one brain to another is equivalent to, but likely
many orders of magnitude harder, translating a book from one language
to another, where many words are completely lacking or have different
meanings. You don't have the same neurons as I do, and the
microstructure of our brains differ quite a bit. Even the
macrostructure is noticeably different in identical twins! Finding
the "right" neural nets to modify in skill or memory transfer is
hence very, very hard. It is likely easier to do some "compressed
training" in the upload brain, where an external (possibly AI) system
trains, monitors and modifies the brain during training, possibly
even running the trainee in paralell and merging the results.

What we will need to truly be able to transfer skills, memories and
experience is some kind of "neural lingua franca"; maybe add-on lobes
of our uploaded brains which are identical in all people and
information inside them hence can easily be transferred.

It is likely part of our skills; the neural networks which correspond
to different abilities overlap, and have no sharp edges. Our habits,
personalities and quirks are integrated into them. Hunches might be
the result of subconscious processing "bubbling up to the surface" so
to say.

Very true. This is my vision of paradise.

You will likely still need to study, in order to make use of the
information. Merely having the sum of human knowledge at your
fingertips won't help you much. You will need skills to search though
it (how would you do to find out what rheology is about?), critical
thinking (is the physics of Jack Sarfatti reasonable?) and the
ability to integrate it to a whole (what does evolutionary theory,
memetics and western history say about the future of postmodernism?).

One good news/bad news aspect of uploading is that it should be possible
to run the simulation a lot faster than an organic brain.  Rather than
electrochemical activity which switches on the order of milliseconds,
electronic circuits can switch in nanoseconds these days.  You might be
able to have your brain sped up by thousands or even millions.

The down side is that this does not confer any immediate advantage on you.
In and of itself, running faster does not improve your quality of life.
What it does give you is a potential competitive advantage if you are
thinking faster than other people.  So if the future world is one in which
competition is a significant factor, there will be pressure to run your
brain as fast as you can.

This is too bad, because actually in most ways the quality of life will
be worse for the super-fast brain.  From the brain's point of view, it
is as though the rest of the world is slowed down by a huge factor.
Everything will be slow - computers, communication, any manipulation of
the physical world.  If you need to do experiments to learn more about
nature, they will take (subjective) centuries to complete.  If you want
to access those miraculous libraries from around the world, better plan
on (subjective) minutes or hours to get results.  No more instant access.
If you expect to live in a nifty VR, think again: computers will be a
million times slower (subjectively) which will limit the quality of the
simulations they can provide.  You may have to live in a cartoon world.

Some people look at this and say, "yeah, but I can get centuries of
work and thinking done in a single day!"  I say, "wow, it will take
subjective centuries for even a single day's worth of change in the
physical world."  I hope you like the weather, because you're going to
be stuck with it for a while.

        In addition, why would one want to be able to pick up a program that
makes them the "ultimate pianist?"  Something must be said for the earning
of knowledge...an upload program such as this would be much to simple and
probably dissatisfying.  Also, most of piano playing (and indeed, most other
skills) is about exploration and desire even more than it is ability.
Perhaps if there was an upload that could hone the hand\eye
abilities and increase the comprehension of the piano (or whatever) that
might be effective, though I still doubt that it would give the player the
same level of appreciation.  It goes along with the same idea that "...it is
what man does not achieve that makes him strive to be the best."

        This is partially based upon personal experience: I have played the
piano for ten years...the first four with lessons, the latter four without.
Needless to say, the aquired knowledge of the first four years has helped me
to explore the areas of the last six.

And, since our brains will one day be obsolete architecture, we'll need
to become software loadable onto the newest neural network in order to
compete economically. Otherwize, AI's will replace us as the dominant

I am being interviewed for a business magazine about where the Internet is
going - and what we expect to see around 2010 and beyond.  The audience is
more business orientated than necessarily technical.  The angle I am taking
is one of a free-fall imagination of undaunted possibilities for
transhumans.  This is good because the magazine is interested in innovative
possibilities.

Any points you might think are especially fascinating and surprising would
be helpful.  I don't want to miss anything that you all might think is
important, so please participate.

Thank you and I look forward to your comments.

Very true. Still, I would like to be able to learn the basics of many
fields so that I could develop them further in my own style. often I
have found that one has to learn the basics just to understand if a
field is worth pursuing or not, and what potential one has in it. If
basic knowledge could be transferred, it would be great. But I doubt
anybody could download "Microsoft Ultimate Pianist" and become more
than a brilliant entertainment at the next party. 

What we value in pianists (and other experts) is their personal
touches, that is why we don't regard painting by numbers as art (but
if you start from painting by numbers and then do something
individual with it, like changing the colors or adding new details,
then you are suddenly creating art). Maybe in the future art school
will consist of one week of downloading of technical skills, and then
several years of individualization.

Even so it's not clear that discarding the body is a good strategy.
In most cases only a couple of offspring are going to survive the
rigors of infancy, with the challenges to their immune system and
the difficulties due to their small size and inexperience.  In that
case keeping the adult alive will mean that the gene will have three
surviving instances rather than two, a considerable improvement.
The adult has already proven its survival abilities and should be
considered a valuable asset.

Plus, in each child any given gene has only a 50% chance of being selected.
In the adult it has a 100% chance.

The real mystery then is why genes allow the reproductive period to stop
rather than working harder to extend fertility.  Actually men are often
fertile into their 60's and even beyond, so this discard-the-body theory
doesn't explain why so many symptoms of aging show up before then.

Is it just that the genes can't do any better, that despite their best
efforts, errors and waste accumulate and the cells just don't work
as well?  Why then are egg cells kept so fresh and clean generation
after generation?  Think about it: every cell in your body is the direct
offspring via fission of an earlier cell, and that line *literally* goes
back billions of years.  Somehow it was able to keep itself clean and
avoid accumulated junk, until the last couple of dozen cell generations,
since it became part of your kidney or whatever.  All of a sudden it's
just too difficult to prevent damage?  After millions and millions
of generations?  That's hard to believe.

Probably a better theory is that the genes could have kept people alive
and fertile longer, but that it didn't help because death by misfortune
was still so common.  The healthiest man (or ape) in the world might
not have expected to live much beyond 50 due to the harsh and dangerous
world he lived in.

And actually, humans live pretty long compared to most mammals.  Many of
us have experienced the sadness of a pet dog or cat dying after only 10
or 20 years.  Maybe that was all they could expect in the wild even if
they stayed healthy.  It could be that our own lifespan has increased in
the last few million years, as our increased intelligence allowed us
to avoid dangers.  70 years isn't that bad by this reasoning - it could
have been a lot worse.

Maybe its very expensive to keep stuff this clean.  Its worth doing
for a few eggs, but not for the whole body?

An analogy is the transition from nomadic herding to farming.  Farming
was a worse life style by most accounts -- including worse food and
harder labor.  But it was a vastly larger economic niche, and most of
us are descended from people who filled it.

     ready to pass from physical matter-bound immortality to a lighter 
     energy form?  
     
     We all fancy immortality or at least life extension with good quality 
     of life but I don't even think it would take a century for an immortal 
     to become quite weary of a matter-bound existence.  Granted, if the 
     majority were to become "immortal" in the physical sense, we'd likely 
     get a lot more done, with no preoccupation on time constraints or 
     energy spent fearing the limits of our own mortality.  
     
     Fundamentally, I think we ultimately want freedom and retention of 
     self-awareness, two things we perceive death robs us of.  (Whether it 
     does or not is answered individually for us post-mortem I suppose...if 
     we care...if we're still there to care...).  
     
     Living in the here and now, we can yammer on about quality of life, 
     quests for the stars, soundness of financial investments, exploiting 
     anything beneath us on the food/brain chain, yadda, yadda, yadda.  
     It's all well and good, keeps the neurons firing and ideas 
     percolating, passes the time and provides intrigue and distraction.  
     
     But what if we as humans (or perhaps the posthuman motif of Extropian 
     design) have the transcendent mechanism to shift immortality from 
     physically-bound to an ethereal situation.  
     
     Don't know about some of you but being fabulously wealthy in a chateau 
     by the sea with plenty of servants and assured physical immortality 
     doesn't hold a candle to the ability to experience the consciousness 
     of an eagle over the mountains, a wave cresting, a thunderhead 
     culminating, a whale breaching, a redwood capturing a spring breeze, . 
      I could actually see spending even a fraction of eternity (lets say a 
     thousand millennia) instilling my matter-emancipated consciousness 
     into other physical manifestations and assimilating the "knowing" of 
     the experience into my being(acquiring experience, BTW, is what I've 
     assigned to be the meaning of life).  Experience is the ultimate 
     upload.  Matter-bound existence seriously limits the quality and 
     quantity of experience gathering I suspect.
     
     So what of it?  Care to engage in a discussion as to whether genes 
     will have soon served their usefulness and will give way to higher 
     forms of communicating essence and design to (for the next several 
     billion years) a blooming and fertile universe?

Nanotech is a great concept and a fine thing to work on but
I don't think it is the shortest path to dealing with the problem
of aging.  Nanotech is similar to computers, in that
you will have many different generations of the technology.  I
think machine intelligence and nanotechnology are the essence
of where we are going but I can see simpler routes to some of
the basic problems with our bodies.

Using nanotech to stop aging is still going to require an 
understanding of the body.  The various nano devices will have
to be designed.  It may be possible to redesign much of the body
from scratch but the brain will require greater faithfulness
to the original.

I know it sounds like a kludge but I think in the short term 
preserving and augmenting the brain by a combination of understanding 
(neuronal processes and neuronal aging), pharmacy, gene therapy,
and partial replacement with computer circuits will buy time until
complete brain replacement is possible.  Some simple nanotech could
help a lot here but I don't think it is required.

One nice sideline of the neuro approach is the likelihood of
stumbling onto ways to augment human intelligence.  Personally
I'd just as soon stay smarter than the computers until I am at
least part computer myself.  I don't think its terribly 
important but I appeals to me.

Up until about a year ago I thought working on molecular 
modeling software while trying to use as much machine
intelligence as possible and paying a lot of attention to protein
chemistry and neurochemistry was the prefect start.  From 
there one is positioned to go in a lot of directions and is
unlikely to be poor in the mean time.  

Now I feel the main thing to be done is to understand the aging 
brain, figure out how to keep it alive, and improve it's functioning.
This is a more conservative approach.  I see this as the number
one problem we face and until I really understand what is the
minimum requirement to solve the problem of brain aging I am not 
willing to assume it will be easy or hard and I am not willing to
skip ahead.

For me all of this is just conceptual for a while.  My own
current idea is to do as much as I can to take advantage of the
technologies, skills, etc. currently available to keep me alive
and functioning at my best, and to help others do the same.
I think this makes sense for anyone who has not already done it
because I don't know how long the big stuff will take, because
it is comparatively easy (it lets me do something I can make
progress at in a time frame my mind can grasp), and it will help 
me be more capable of progress on the big stuff when I get there.

Of course even the simple stuff isn't that simple.  How do I know
which supplements make sense without some aging theory? What are
my favorite ways to gain lots of additional benefits from my work 
while making a comfortable living?  Which things present meaningful 
short term risks and which are not significant enough to bother 
with. Etc.  The long term guesses do help some.

Anyway Eric, your strategy seems fine to me; it is hard to go wrong
with computation or chemistry paired with a keen mind.  I would love
to hear more about why you think nanotechnology is the shortest path
though.

Most of your points sound good here are a few more.

As Robin pointed out maintaining fidelity in the germ line requires a 
lot of energy.  There is a very large burst of gene repair activity
involved.  It would be to costly (for poor primitive genes) to maintain 
the whole body that well in the world we evolved in.  Also there is a 
balance between optimal mutation rates for adaptive change and the cost 
of those mutations in terms of survival.

Genes are not the only thing competing for survival here.  Most of the
things that are relatively poor at surviving are not very well
represented in the world.  I don't think that bodies have ever passively
accepted a role as mere carriers of the genes but they also compete
with the genes they carry.  The process of life goes on at many
different levels simultaneously.  I would like to get a better
understanding of processes on a larger scale than me.

The egg and sperm cells ('germ line') avoid accumulated junk by killing
mutants.  The number of DNA changes per human reproduction is on the order
of five, i.e. an error rate per base of 10^-9.  Most of the changes either
don't make any difference, or are so bad that the embryo is spontaneously
aborted.  The remainder are fodder for natural selection.

I don't think the mutation rate is different for germ line than for other
('somatic') cells.  Remember that a single wrong mutation in a somatic cell
can cause cancer, and there are trillions of somatic cells, some of which
reproduce every few weeks.

I completely agree with your first statement I quoted above. Part
of the reason for my current enthusiasm about nanotech is its
potential in creating new scientific instruments. So much of the
nanotech horse-and-pony show ("popularization") focuses on benefits
that ordinary consumers, voters, and taxpayers can understand that
this is sometimes glossed over.

What would be the best possible data-collection instruments for
deciphering the mechanisms of gene expression and ontogenesis? What
would be the best possible data-collection instruments for exploring
the fine structure of (and the patterns of decay and degradation
in) the brain? In either case, I think that if molecular nanotech
is possible, then molecular nanotech will probably produce the most
valuable scientific instruments for this research.

So I'm not just looking for a technological quick-fix that will
give us uploading and cheap transportation to LEO. I'm looking for
a technological quick-fix that will give us vastly greater ability
to explore and understand the functioning (and possible repair) of
our own brains/bodies. ;)

But you know, one of the nice things about a market economy is how
it inoffensively promotes division of labor (well, inoffensively
when it's working at its best, that is). If for some reason nanotech
becomes a major fad (and that certainly hasn't happened yet), then
perhaps I'll be satisfied that that ground is being well covered,
and go back to trying to figure out how recursive/feedback
unsupervised-learning neural net technology works.

Let me see if I can get this right.  Start with a self replicating organism,
the faster it replicates, the more accurately it replicates and the longer
it is not destroyed the more copies of it there will be around at any given
time.  The organism may mutate or be copied with differences.  The organism
may compete with it's copies and/or mutated copies for resources.  At no
time are the number of copies increased by removing the original and no
unmutated copy is any more productive than the original but the original 
becomes a progressively smaller part of the number of organisms.

Some types of mutated organisms survive, or replicate more often than 
others. They become more plentiful. These organisms can cooperate, gang-up 
or practice many other behaviors and the behaviors that most contribute 
to fast replication, accurate replication and individual survival will be 
the ones that are present in greatest numbers.

These organisms can be classified into those that go for lots of 
copies and those that go for a few copies with more resources allotted 
to each.  It all gets more complicated when we introduce sexual 
reproduction, niches, and organisms that build bodies around themselves 
consisting of other organisms. None of this gets away from the concept 
that what last the longest and makes the greatest number of faithful 
copies of itself is that which will be most common.

Of course as others have mentioned there are destructive genes that
survive only because they happen to be near beneficial genes.  And
there are genes that help an organism survive and reproduce when
young, only to cause it trouble latter.  And yes a more slowly 
reproducing older organism can get in the way of it's more productive
offspring.  Once an organism can no longer reproduce its contributes
to genetic survival by its own existence and by assisting its offspring.
Evolution increases individual survival and reproduction whenever
it is economical to do so but reproduction is often the easier thing to
enhance.

Another interesting strategy involves organisms that do not replicate
themselves but rather make mutated versions of themselves.  Organisms
that create other mutated organisms have a chance to create something
which is more likely to become common than their creator.  At this
point a competition can develop between different lines of mutating
processes with some processes becoming more common than others.  

This introduces a concept that is new to me.  If I view evolution as a
competition between systems of chemical reactions to produce as many
other chemical reactions as possible I gain a different perspective.  
Evolution becomes not a competition for survival but instead a 
competition for effect with survival and replication being
part of the equation but not as important as keeping something going.
This is very in line with my own goals with the difference being that
I place a higher premium on being around to see what happens.

Human genes look like the best things so far at producing long
life with rapid adaptive change. Clearly intelligence is a win but 
the human species may be a bit to chaotic and start the whole process 
over or it may create a more efficent species to replace it.  Biology
(like my post) often takes 7 right turns to go left.  

I'll go back to personifying genes now.  What genes want is to create
the most capable and durable things they can.  To do this of course
they want intelligent beings capable of complex behavior.  They want
beings that eventually reach a point where starting over is unlikely
to yield anything better and instead evolve by making gradual
modifications to themselves.  

They want a universe full of capable beings that choose cooperation 
over violent competition because they are more likely to survive 
that way and want to avoid starting over with new beings when 
the odds of getting something better are remote.  The genes
also feel it is important to get as much life energy out of the
slowly cooling universe as possible by capturing highly energetic
molecules and harnessing them to do useful work on relatively cold
and lifeless matter.

The genes are really quite reasonable and want nothing more than to
see us thrive.  Really their main flaw is that they are a little
dense and they are from Missouri.  Once we show them that we are
what they have been working for all these many millions of years,
by eliminating aging, and not engaging in destructive competition
with other highly capable life forms when a constructive alternative 
is available, I am sure they will be thrilled and trouble us only a 
little.  

Immortality does not short circuit evolution but rather completes
one phase of it.  Immortality or at least extreme longevity is one 
of the things evolution tends to produce (gray goo is another 
possibility but I am an optimist).  

Anyway, this topic is starting to remind me of some lectures on 
neural nets, how to avoid getting stuck in sub optimal minimums 
by introducing chaos, and the ways I might enhance the process 
by cycling the level of chaos and consolidation in a goal directed
way, so Ill go try to find something more useful to do.

It only sounds like a kludge if you have no wisdom. :)  "Primum non

My current emphasis is on trying to understand human group and power
psychology, so I can make maximum impact on creating a world that
1) I'd want to come back to and
2) wouldn't mind bringing me back.

I see that, not as the number one problem we face (there are a lot of
number ones), but as the one where I can make the biggest difference. Our
goals are parallel; a "rope" approach beats a "chain" approach if the path
is uncertain.

Double-plus affirmative. Do what you know how to do, then look at the

Everyone seems to know why uploading would be an advantage (the usual
uploading memories, eternal life, etc.)  But my original question was this:-

To simulate physical object (which we all are) in all detail (all detail to
our knowlege) would take more physical space than the original object.  For
instance, say I wanted to simulate a single atom, and I wanted to simulate
this on a nano-computer.  To simulate that atom, would infact take more atoms
(for storage, processing, ect.) than the atom I am simulating.  The
information will always require more physical space than the actual object
the information is about.  Obviously a image of a house takes less space (in
the form of a storage medium) than the house itself, but that is only a
image, the simulate an actual house, would mean to simulate everything at a
nanoscopic level.

We may well be able to simulate the 'functions' of a brain, but would this be
a brain?  Just because we've made rules to make it look like a brain, doesn't
mean it *is* a brain.  I believe that in-order to simulate a brain you would
have to simulate every detail, thus offering no advantages over the original
brain (infact the new brain would be at a disadvantage).

However, seeing what it's like to become a different species or downloading
knowlege directly into your brain could still be just as possible in the real
world.  The universe is the ultimate computer, any computer that exists
inside of it is inferior.

Not necessarily. Most objects are highly redundant (order usually
means that the object can be described succintly, chaos is hard to
describe), which means you can optimize the simulation a lot.
Besides, if your simulation has a lowest scale, a computer using
scales below it could easily be smaller.

But what is "every detail"? Every neural network? Every neuron? Every
synapse? Every ion channel? Every atom? Every quantum? If it turns
out that it is enough to simulate ever synapse, then we could likely
build a nanocomputer that is smaller. Quantum computing might even
make it possible to do some atomic scale simulations in a smaller
space if we are lucky and clever. 

My personal guess is that we will need roughly the synaptic level of
detail; ion channels are practically identical (a kind of
nanodevices really) and can likely be handled statistically, if atoms
were important we would have a trouble with them wandering around the
whole place, and quantum effects are best left to the Church of the
Holy Trinity of Penrose, Hameroff and Sarfatti. :-)

Personally I think this is the logical step, although I would not
call it a "lighter energy form" (that term in my opinion reeks of
cheap new age). I think information is the future. Information is of
course always implemented in matter or energy, but the point is that
it can be abstracted and copied into new matrices (this shows me to
be a believer in the Strong AI Hypothesis); information is the
"light energy" which can be easily transferred, stored, mutated and
evolved.

As somebody put it: "the best way of not making a mind is not to give
it a body". We need to be embodied in some sense to have experiences,
to be able to grow. Of course, this embodiment may be quite different
from our current form (digital signals in a computer, quantum
fluctuations, cards in Searle's chinese room). 

I think it is very useful to experience "being" different kinds of
systems, although I don't see how you could experience being a
thundercloud. Maybe you could map its dynamics into your sensory
input, possibly even emotional signals?

I don't think anybody here disputes this view much. What may be more
interesting to discuss is how to practically make this transition.

	This question is easy enough to answer, at least in females of the human
species.  Menopause actually helps genes in a primitive setting because the
female is able to participate in activities that help the survival of grand
children and other relatives (remember the whole tribe is related).  Old
members of tribes (male or female, but usually female because they live
longer) are also valuable because they have a great deal of knowledge.  The
lived through that hurricane fifty years ago so they know how to survive
the next one.  They know what plants can be eaten when the staple food is
unavailable.  It would be most unfortunate if this knowledge was lost in
child birth.
	It's important to remember that organisms can affect the survival of their
genes after they have reproduced.  This can be a force for extending life
spans.  The fact that certain things help in early life during the
reproductive years hurt in later life (for example, limited cell divisions

sustainability) is possibly more responsible for death, at least among
humans, than uselessness to genes.  Evolution is a balancing act where
benefits must be weighed against costs, and the end result is the life span
we have now.

I agree completely as semi-involved in this field. Right now we are
making antibodies and pouring them on cells, creating knockout mice
and measuring cells using glass electrodes. Stone age! I heard about
a team who has been working for months to build a model of a *single*
neuron using electron microscope images of different slices. Much
mroe detail than images from a confocal microscope, including the
synapses which most likely are the places where the real fun is going
on. Now imagine using a nanoscanner to do this. Or being able to
inject nanomachines that seek out synapses and mark them. Or analyze
them. Or do in vivo statistics on chemical gradients. Or can modify
the membrane on command. Or... or... nanotech would be a wonderful
boon to neuroscience.

Okay, that makes sense you are thinking of building tools in an
important and neglected area and I am thinking in terms of 
solving a problem while counting on others to develop the tools 
(unless I hit a wall or think of something elegant).

My view is probably too extreme for your audience: The net will
trancend to superintelligence, initially in collaboration
witn one or more humans,  before the date you mention.
See http://www.shirenet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm
for details.

Even if this is too far out, you may still wish to allude to it
to show that the other ideas aren't as ceazy as it's possible
to get.

	Yes, I didn't mean to imply that our initial move to another
platform would "instantly make us totally malleable".  Many have
already brought up many important issues like the extreme complexity
and integrated nature of our memories.  Of course complete
understanding of all this would be required before we could start
increasing our intelligence and finally being able to "plug in a PhD".

	But, the only difference between someone before his PhD and
after is only a material state change.  Currently we really have to
struggle to make that amount of state change because of our inability
to directly comprehend and directly manipulate the relevant brain
matter.  Surely, some day, though admittedly likely a very difficult
and complex process, we should be able to achieve such state changes
much easier on a future platform.

	I really like Anders comments:

	Yes, I imagine an additional visual cortex, for example, being
added.  Rather than receiving data from an additional set of eyes, the
visual space being experienced in another visual cortex is simply
being identically reproduced.  With such an enhancement we will
probably discover that some people have inverted or different color
qualia for representing various wavelengths of light.  I emagine
generic lobes and cortexes being able to reproduce arbitrary
sensations and ideas identically as others are experiencing them based
on data from brain observers.  "wow, that isn't what salt tastes like
to me!" some future enhanced person might say.

	Evolution wired a very valuable joy to the chemical content of
cheese cake.  But this particular pleasure is completely arbitrary.
This is proved by synesthesia (miss wiring) where people taste things
like shapes.  At first we may only be able to switch them off.  But
surely, eventually, we will be able to completely rearchitect them at
will.

	Only when we can so choose and change what we want to want
will we really be free.  Now, we are simply hard wired to want cheese
cake by our creator.  Surely we will be able to eventually cut these
puppet strings and become truly free.

	No.  Abstract representation, though behaviorally similar is
nothing like the phenomenal representations and feelings we use to
represent information.  Currently color detecting machines can tell us
what color things are many times better than we can.  But what the
machine uses to represent this color knowledge is nothing like the
phenomenal, or spiritual if you will, stuff we use to represent color.

	A simple abstract representation of us may behave the same but
when we ask the abstract simulation what the color blue is like it's
abstract representations of what we would try to say to describe blue
would simply lie since it would only represent information abstractly
and it wouldn't have anything to do with the phenomenal sensations we
represent such information with.

	In order to upload ourselves we must do more than abstractly
represent such sensations.  We must learn how to accurately reproduce
the precise sensations and feelings we now use to represent our
conscious knowledge, not just do it with abstract structures.  I want
red to be much more than a certain pattern of abstract bits in my
future uploaded self.  Abstraction isn't enough!  We must have
identical phenomenal representations.

Meiosis and recombination, which are performed only in the process of sexual
reproduction, also allow repairing certain kinds of DNA damage that can't be
fixed in normal replication.  It would be very complicated for the rest of
the body to reproduce meiotically, to put it mildly.

	We already live in a cartoon world!  (Although I prefer to
call it a spiritual world).  Everything we are directly aware of is
reproduced inside our brain via the data collected by our senses.
This entire world that is our conscious knowledge is inside our brain.
You aren't directly aware of that tree out beyond your eyes.  You
can't be because the information flows into your eyes, not out of!
You only have a phenomenal representation of that tree in your cartoon
world inside your brain.  When you stub your toe, the pain isn't in
the real toe, that would be impossible.  The pain is inside the cartoon
toe that is inside this cartoon world that is entirely inside your
head.  All this stuff only represents what is out beyond your senses.

	There is no color, smell, warmth, pain and so on and so forth
outside our brains.  This is all cartoon stuff. (I prefer to call it
spiritual stuff) There is only the light, chemical content, vibrating
molecules, and the destruction and such that these cartoon things only
consciously represent.

	The exciting thing about uploading, is we will finally be able
to escape from our lonely isolated cartoon worlds, that are trapped
inside our skulls, into a unified and shared spiritual world of global
consciousness.

Dear fellow extropians,
At the severe risk of being considered regressive, I believe that the
pleasure of learning should be given full consideration before we
abandon the joy (and even pain) of slowly accumulating knowledge and
formulating ideas through continuous cognitive development.
Although the idea of an intellectual implant that gives us an instant
lifetime of knowledge and pleasure might have its merits, the depth of
emotion and the spirit of humanism that might be lacking under those
conditions should give us some pause for further consideration. Is
knowledge worth having without at least some effort and passion?

Hi!

I'm glad to see there were so many replies to my message. Thank you all.

First of all, I'm going to the U.S. East Coast in August. I'm new to
this mailing list but I would sure like to meet some other extropians,
is there any of you in the East Coast in August willing to meet me?

After reading your replies, I couldn't still form a conclusive opinion
(is there anybody who can?) but here's some of my thoughts and comments
on your replies.

I think we all agree that genes are selfish and care about us only to
create more like them.

One divergent opinion was weather a gene that codes for extra longevity
is good or evil? (in terms of reproductive success)

My opinion is that it is good. If one organism lives longer, it has a
higher chance to produce more offspring and therefore it is a good gene.
It's as simple as that.

William Wiser wrote:

You're making a mistake, you are assuming that aging is only the decayed
state humans reach at their 70s, 80s, etc. This is not truth, the
chances of a primitive human (or other mammal) to survive decrease due
to aging after he reaches puberty (that is why primitive humans never
died from the aging you name, they died at the first signs of aging).
So, a non-aging primitive human should have an advantage.

Anders Sandberg wrote this Medawar suggestion:
> living longer would be a
> slight disadvantage (competition of resources)

The gene is selfish, it only cares about himself and it is not going to
kill himself as an altruistic act to favour others. The gene will
continually create more copies, that is his mission.

Finally, Lee Daniel Crocker wrote:

If aging is not present, reproduction is never done, the body is always
useful to the genes and evolutionary preassure is always present.

If, indeed, a gene that codes for extra longevity is an advantage, why
isn't it present?

I don't know. The species that do not endure aging are very primitive
ones, perhaps in mammals it is much more complex and since with aging we
can still reproduce, the species continues. Perhaps to stop aging is so
complex that it will take millions or billions of years for aging to
naturally stop (although the consequences would be disastrous). Let's
see what we have to say about it.

                  Hasta la vista...

Since I won't be able to make it to Extro3, and I'm a chump for not
sending in my membership fee yet, I'd like to just put in my two cents:

BOTH.

Yes, both will occur. Its all relative. Those living through it will see
it as a continuity, while those looking at it from the present, or the
far future ahead of this period, it will look like a singularity due to
the cultural event horizon effect that will occur over a very short time
period. Even if it takes a few decades for everyone on the planet to
transcend, it will still seem continuous for those experiencing it, and
discontinuous for those exclusively on either side of it. Like looking
at a highway with a bend in it. To those on either side of the bend, it
looks like there is a break in the road, but as you go through the
turn,  you see that it is continuous...

I would say that the evolved average lifespan was arrived at by
offsetting the human reproductive rate against the death rate, such that
we naturally live long enough (counting disease, accidents, and
predation) only enough to allow a stable population under normal
circumstances. Too long a natural lifespan, and we would have seen in
prehistorical archeological times, periods of population explosion and
contraction similar to the deer/wolf population interaction. As we can
see in the present, by technologically changing this dynamic, we are
risking our species survival because we are all living too long, and too
many of our children are surviving to reproduce...

If we wanted to evolve longer natural lifespans, we would have to have a
lower rate of reproduction, possibly in a lower average sperm count, or
in a longer menstrual cycle, or in an earlier onset of menopause. A
later onset of puberty would not be useful, as it would allow the
accumulation of greater resources by individuals prior to reproducing,
thus ensuring greater probability of survival of the next generation.

The current evidence seems to support the notion that economic
interference by the state is bad economics, but will this always be the
case?  It is not inconcievable that advances in complex adaptive systems
theory, or some other discipline, may lead to the discovery of "lever points"
within economies that would allow articulate control of economic
rescources without the fear of collapse.  Economists and scientists (evil
ones, no doubt) could provide policy makers with indefinately sustainable
socialist economic policies.

The possibilty that socialists could finally make their economics work is
not happy news. Even *if* future scientific advances make socialism a
viable system, it will still be slavery.  Only then it would be far more
difficult to overcome than now when "Government doesn't work" is a good
estimation.  Take home message: Stop statism before it developes into
something more efficiant.

You seem to assume that all knowledge would be aquired by simply injecting
pre-existing information into ones "brain."  Sure, I may be able to have
instant access and understanding of quantum mechanics, but to apply that
knowledge to some practicle end would require effort and, IMO, passion as
well.  Think of it like this: The level of common knowledge may increase
exponentially, but discovery is always new.  And the more information you
have access to and understanding of, the more you can contribute to the
expansion of that information base.

I agree, sort of. If you just changed the hardware platform, such as 
replacing biological neurons with nanotechnology ones, it would not give you
new abilities, except for much greater speed and memory. You could recite
from memory any page from a book on advanced Physics, but you might not
understand what it meant.

The great thing about a well designed computer platform is that once somebody
writes a program that gives a machine a new ability it's very easy to give
that ability to all the other machines on the platform. The trouble with the
Human brain is that it is not well designed, it is not designed at all, it's
the product of millions of years of random mutation and natural selection
producing just what you would expect, hideous spaghetti code. Well designed 
programs are easy to modify, with a sloppy program it's hard to even figure
out how the damn thing works much less modify it, that's why it takes years 
to learn to play the piano. A master pianist can't just transmit his skill to 
others in a few seconds, so we must continually reinvent the wheel.

I'll bet one of the first things an upload would try to do is untangle this
messy code of his into a simpler more logical structure and then recompile
it. This would be a gargantuan task that could take us thousands of years, 
even an upload might be at it for days before he was successful.

In theory all skills must be represented by data. If we have skills then our
neurons must act that way, and they act that way if they have the correct
structure, and they have the correct structure if the atoms in them are in
the right place, and data will tell you if they are in the right place.
Of course, figuring out what placement of atoms will let you play the piano
is very far from trivial.

If technology had advanced enough so we could upload a human mind then we
would certainly have computers and communication links enormously faster than
anything we have now, fast enough to keep up with any upload.

The environment operates at all levels from Pico seconds to billions of years, 
all equally valid, the time frame of a biological human brain does not occupy 
a preferred position in the universe. For example, the arm on a Nanotechnology
based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that
means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm.
Also, just one pound of carbon has enough atoms to make a billion billion
such Nano Robots. I think even the fastest upload would find plenty to do.

Concerning Virtual Reality, I don't see how speed could even be an issue for
an upload. Even if the computer that was emulating you and the virtual world 
was very slow, from your point of view it would seem infinitely fast. If the 
machine had performance problems all you'd have to do is have the part of the 
program that was simulating you slowed down or even stopped, while leaving 
the part of the program that simulated the rest of the universe running at 
normal speed. Regardless of how many calculations it would take to convince 
you that the simulation was real it could all be done instantly, from your 
point of view. Once the machine was caught up, your part of the program could 
be carefully restarted till the next speed bottleneck.

What's this "we" business? The only feelings you can detect directly are your

Pain and joy are also just variables in the uploader universe. In fact, 
careful management of one's emotional R&P circuits should form a pretty 
formidable problem for the uploaders. Morphing knowledge into you can be 
arbitrarily slow, and can be associated with any kind of pleasure you like.

Implanting designed knowledge modules (coco - common coding) into a messy
GA-grown appears very very difficult. I guess a mature uploader will be a 
chimaeric, hybridic thing, made from brittleware logic blocks, and messy 
GA/ANN stuff. Capability of swapping blocks of experience/knowledge (memetic 
crossover/passing a piece of mind) more or less casually appears a 
worthwhile trait, intituitively. But obviously, us worrying about the 
properties of uploaders is mice talking about motivations and properties 
of the two-legged towering beings. Things will be vastly _different_ in 
uploader space. The longer I think about it, the more conservative 
pockets in the digital darwin universe appear nonviable. A fraction of 
uploaders will suddenly zoom off in a fast-forward development. As their 
activities, both in simulated, and physical space will appear 
incomprehensible to those left behind, they mind appear as random natural 
forces. 

I don't know how you feel about it, but I'd rather be a former, than the 
formed.

Knowledge is a key factor of a future fitness function. The way you gain 
it are not really relevant.

P.S. Concerning why death has not been optimized away by evolution: death 
is an integral part of darwinian evolution. Had it not been there right 
from the start, death would have emerged very soon. There will be lots of 
death in central zones of neomoravecian noosphere light cone.

But how then would you know if you were an extropian if you knew nothing
of extropians? 

Information for information's sake is a good thing. Any bit of data,
however small, provides a foundation for further learning. If you had
never had certain resources at your disposal, your learning on certain
subjects would have been severely curtailed. How then can excess
information be a bad thing? Who says you have to care about all of it?
Indeed, without carrying with you what seemed at one point in your life
to be a mundane fact, you might have missed out on an important, perhaps
entirely original connection between navel oranges and the JFK
assasination. Furthermore, without excess data, you may never have
discovered the data set that interests you the most. Finally, if you had
a repository of the accumulated knowledge of mankind throughout history
what would you be doing with your life right now? I imagine that I
probably would not be in law school. I would care little for the
bothersome specifics of human governance and concentrate more fully on
the "big picture." Indeed, if I could spout the law off the top of my
head (and make a cogent argument therefrom) I would be the finest
attorney Court TV had ever seen. 

So then, I see your point about the trial and error of learning which
must not be dismissed lightly. However so much of our time in school is
devoted to understanding what has already been discovered or decided. If
the best and brightest already knew the stuff, how much faster would new
discoveries and decisions be made? 

"Eureka! I have found it!"

"Because you did, I did! Eureka! Look what else I've found!"

Our species survival isn't threatened in the least.  In almost any major
worldwide catastrophe, we would be the last large mammal to go.  Several of
the other last-ditch survivors, like rats and cockroaches, are parasites on
our society.  It's the survival of species that don't have roles in
human-dominated ecosystem which is threatened by human population growth.

Formulated in that way it is too extreme, but I think your basic
ideas could be put in a less extreme way: computer-supported
collaborative work across the net together with decision support,
information agents and other intelligence amplification technologies
will enable small groups to become tremendously productive.

Despite their popularity I doubt that the index funds have a significant
effect on the Dow or S&P 500, for the trading volume of the stocks being
indexed is far larger that that of the index funds.

Remi mentioned using Internet as an artificial ecosystem for artificial life
forms. From a business point of view, the life forms are business objects,
i.e. bank accounts, stock portfolios, etc. The Internet ecosystem is still too
primitive, but with an object bus, like CORBA, these living objects will
have a place to live in. This CORBA thing is really thrilling. It will be the
next level of global human-machine-hybrid intelligence.

Yikes.  I think that we should hammer down some definitions before
this whole thing gets out of hand.

Cryptography:
Building an difficult-to-unhook bra.

Steganography:
Building a flesh-colored bra, or one whose unhook mechanism is
hidden somewhere unexpected (Man:  "How the Hell...?"  Woman:
"It unhooks in front."  Man:  "Damn those steganographers.")

Public-Key Cryptography:
Building a bra that anyone can put on, but that only Alice can
remove.

Watermarking:
Building a bra that stays on even after smoothing, compression,
and rotation.  Also, Bob should not be able to put his own bra
on over Alice's and claim ownership of her body.

Fingerprinting:
Um, I'm probably already in trouble for the last one, so I'll
just skip this.

Signatures:
Building a bra with a nametag ("Property of Alice, machine wash
warm...") such that bras with Alice's name only fit Alice's body.
Bob could in theory remove Alice's bra and replace it with his 
own, but there's no real reason for him to do so.

All-or-Nothing Disclosure Of Secrets:
Alice transforms her bra into a duffle bag, and either (a) shows
Bob how to open it, or (b) shows Bob how she made it into a duffle
bag.  Alice repeats the procedure until Bob is satisfied (perverted
freak).

One-time Pad:
Kleenex.

NSA:	An organization that wants women to go back to wearing corsets and
chastity belts.  Oh, and Bill Clinton gets to keep all the keys.

[looks up at what's written so far and sighs]  I'm so damned juvenile.

	Yes!  As long as we are trapped inside our own spirit world we
can't "eff" feelings.  As long as we don't scientifically understand
them they are ineffable.

	But, once we discover what they are, how and why they are
produced we will be able to eff them.  We will be able to produce a
stimulus inside your brain after possibly altering a few neurons and
say to you: "This is what salt tastes like to someone else".  you
might reply after experiencing the sensation: "Whoa, that isn't what
salt tastes like to me!"  Then you will know for sure that the other
person, though different than yourself, most definitely is conscious!

	Yes, it is very possible that you are telling the truth.
(Although I doubt mere abstract representations could achieve the
particular kind of intelligence you have without absurdly extreme
amounts of bruit force.  How many bits of information must be used to
record all the possible appropriate answers to the question: "What is
blue like"?  It has to be much more efficient to just honestly
reproduce an actual blue sensation.) Today, as you say, we do not have
a way to know for sure.  But, when we discover what blue really is and
how it is produced we will be able to observe the particular
neural/chemical behavior that corresponds to or produces a blue
conscious experience and know for sure if you are lying.  Just because
we can't YET do it doesn't me it is impossible.  Have a little
faith. :)

Hagbard Celine <hagbard@ix.netcom.com> asked in a personal letter,

> > (I prefer to call it spiritual stuff)
> 
> Why do you prefer this?

	Thank you for asking.  I hope you don't mind if I reply to
this publicly since I would love to have much more discussion about
this topic.

	There are many reason.  First and foremost it seems to me to
be the most natural.  This is a vast "cartoon world" inside our mind
that is everything we know.  At the center of this "cartoon world" is
a representation of ourselves.  It is isomorphically very identical to
our real physical selves and mirrors our physical selves via data
collected by our senses.  Calling this our spiritual selves certainly
sounds much better than calling it a "cartoon" rendition of ourselves.
I've always had troubles with words like "qualia" and such.  People
have no idea what you are talking about when you use those kinds of
words.  A quality is something that is not real, but ideas are very
real and have qualities.  Green is something real that has qualities.
It is these real qualities that give us our ability to consciously
represent information.

	"Idea" is another word that is used a lot but people confuse
this with more cognitive representations and thoughts or memories than
with something more tangible like color itself.  Too many people
mistakenly think the color green is something beyond your eye on the
surface of a tree and an idea is something in your mind.  They are
both spiritual stuff and everything we consciously know is constructed
of various forms of this stuff inside our heads.

	Calling it a virtual reality world is also incorrect.  A
virtual reality world is abstract.  It doesn't matter what is doing
the representation.  But in our spirit world red abstractly represents
other things but it itself is not abstract.  It most definitely
matters how it is represented.  In a virtual reality world you can
swap the meaning of one's and zeros (or whatever is doing the actual
physical representation of such) and everything will still act the
same.  But if you swap red and blue you have a very different
conscious spirit world.

	Further, scientists and philosophers have been avoiding this
"S" word for years now.  I ask why?  This is what has caused the great
divide between scientific thinking and religious thinking.  To me, the
most important goal of science today is to discover what this
substance of ideas is.  What is consciousness made of?  I believe we
are about to discover precisely what this mirracusouls phenomenal
stuff is as Crick argues in his book: "The Astonishing Hypothesis".
This will be the most significant discovery made to date by man.  This
discovery is what will make uploading possible.  For me, it is
precisely the discovery of the spiritual.

	Realizing that this spirit world exists inside our mind
rationally explains all the "spiritual" phenomenon religious people
claim proves we have a spirit.  Of course it is possible for our
spiritual selves to have an out of body experience in this cartoon
world.  Of course there is phantom limb pain after an amputation.  It
is the spiritual self in our brain which hasn't had it's spirit limb
amputated feeling the phantom pain.  This is real stuff that really
exists just as our physical body exists.  We must call it something.
What is more natural than calling it the spiritual self inside the
spiritual world inside our brain?

	Anything is possible in this dream world and that is why so
many people have so many experiences that they think are "spiritually
supper natural".  They are spiritual but they are not supper natural.
If people realized that all this was simply occuring in the natural
fantasy spirit world inside our brain and not beyond our brain people
could more rationally think about and understand the significance of
all such occurrences.

	Also, most people reject the notion of abstract uploading
because deep down they know there is something spiritual inside of us.
What an abstract machine uses to represent red is very different than
what we use to represent red.  True, we will be able to make an
abstract copy of ourselves that has no spirit at all, but this is not
uploading.  It is only abstract simulation.  There is no feeling
involved.  Such would be a zombie that would be lying when it was
trying to describe what the color blue is really like since none of
what it knew would be represented with real blue.  Blue is not some
abstract representation of a particular wavelength of light.  It is
something very phenomenal and real.  It is like something and not
merely abstract.  We must accept the fact that an upload must be to a
similar spiritual platform which uses the same emotional or phenomenal
stuff to consciously represent this particular wavelength of light not
merely any old abstract representation.

	These are my thoughs on this subject, what do you think?  Do
you fear or wince at the idea of calling it "spiritual" stuff?  If so
then why?

Not quite.  The agent of evolution is the individual gene, not entire
organism genomes.  Genes actually prefer to be in a bunch of different
individuals so they don't have all their eggs in one basket, so to speak.
 Too many copies, or even children, of the same individual can actually be
bad in that they may all share some particular weakness.

Probably, though, the primary reason for aging is that it's easier to make
more copies than to make the copies last longer.

No, nothing of the sort.  Technically, of course, genes don't "want" anything
since they don't think.  However, since they have been very extensively
selected for the ability to make copies of themselves, it's a useful
shorthand to say they "want" to reproduce.  If the business of life
eradicating itself had come up, genes would "want" to avoid it; but it never
has, so there's been no selection on it, so the genes don't "care" about it. 

Many genes do encourage violent competition and do quite well by it.  

>The genes are really quite reasonable and want nothing more than to

The genes "want" as many copies of themselves as possible, by whatever means
possible.  And they are *incredibly* dense.  Insofar as they "think", it's
over evolutionary timescales.

Oh, and our genes are from Africa :-)

Actually if we get to that point, memes will be running the show and not
genes.  The genes will just be tools at that point and considering them as
self-interested agents won't give any useful information.  Genes can't be
emotional, anyway, there's no sense in which they would be "thrilled".  They
just act as if they had goals.

     There is already pressure on humans to multi-task and process faster.

     a) technological intelligent agents to be our major domos for 
     retrieving information.
     b) physiological improvements (thru nutrition? training? drugs? shock

     have a look at the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn or some of the 
     futurist/archetypal studies by Joseph Campbell or Jean Houston.  Also, 
     "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken Wilber.
     
     The beginning of agriculture is the beginning of great things and 
     not-so-great things.  Agriculture ultimately gave us time to ponder 
     the universe once we had stockpiled enough.  Of course, the first 
     banks were created to safeguard grain supplies.  On the down side, 
     hording, imbalance and exploitation were agricultural byproducts that 
     have had quite a negative impact on civilization as well.  The 
     "dominator" culture as it is referred to by Quinn.  Archetypally, Cain 
     (the farmer) slew Able (the herder) so there's a long-term association 
     of agriculture with violence/exploitation/dominance.

     course always implemented in matter or energy, but the point is that
     it can be abstracted and copied into new matrices (this shows me to

     Don't take this the wrong way (i.e. defensively) but I continue to

     "New Age", I see nothing illogical, inappropriate or even 
     simple-minded about a description like "lighter energy form".  Mass 
     wise, this is a no-brainer.  
     
     When a judgment like this is slapped on a term because of its 
     associative meanings with ideologies (apprently) incongruous with 
     extropian thinking, I immediately am compelled to leave the main topic 
     and explore the reflexive nature of such a response such as "cheap new

     to clarify a discomfort or prejudice.  And if that was necessary, I'm 
     intrigued to drill down into the "why".

Due to the availability of information, anonymity and ability to do business
on demand, I expect successful companies consisting of teenagers and young
adults to become commonplace.  Children that are recieving a better education
than we ever did (due to the availability of information) will have newer,
more original ideas and will stand a better chance in the fast paced digital
economy.  I expect most of todays companies will not be able to survive the
dramatic changes ahead.  Large companies will split into smaller, more
malleable parts.

I don't think people would see Extropian ideas as a threat until they start
to become a reality.  Most people can't grasp them, or simply dismiss them as
stupidity.  However, if we started serious attempts to aid research into
these things (which I would like to see us do) then they'll be problems.

How about an extropian party!?  Maybe then we'll see some change.

This sounds like a circular argument to me; you're saying that genes let
us die because they'll live longer in a young body than an old one. In
practice a young body has a good chance of dying before it reaches
reproductive age whereas its parents could continue reproducing forever
were it not for the fact that our genes let us die. 

I like Dawkins' explanation; fatal genes which kill us after the point
where reproduction stops but which have no detrimental effect before that
point will not be evolved out, which means that on average we won't live
too much longer than the upper reproductive age of human females.

I think this has a darker undertone: an ALife golem population, sent out

Naturalness is relative.  I suspect that to most people "spiritual"
is not a natural description of the internal representations created
by the mind.  Rather, they associate it with religion and mysticism.
It is a completely misleading use of the word for most people.

Why not just call it an internal representation?  That's the phrase you
resorted to when you wanted people to understand you.  Use the terms
which promote understanding, not confusion.

I'm not familiar with Crick's book, but I can't imagine that any
scientific explanation of consciousness will make uploading possible in
itself.  The hard problem is and will remain getting specific information,
at the neural level, about the internal workings of the brains that we
want to upload, and having computers big enough to accurately model them.
It should be possible to create uploads without having any scientific
understanding of consciousness per se.

Not in the sense people think of it, where the out of body experience
represents an actual interaction with remote parts of the real
world.  Here is where your terminology is confusing.  There are
two interpretations of an OOB experience.  One is that it happens
strictly within your brain, a simulation of what it would be like if
you could go out and interact with the world mentally; the other is that
something actually leaves your body (as the name implies) and goes out
and interacts with the real world.  You, who are trying to draw a sharp
distinction between our internal representations and what is "out there",
should be the most aware of this.  If someone in the next room puts a
randomly chosen playing card on the table, and I visit that room in an
OOB experience, can I expect to come back and say what that card is?
The two explanations provide exactly opposite predictions about the
outcome.  Which do you accept?

It is more natural to call it the brain's representation of the state
of its body.

Surely you are aware that for hundreds of years people have been arguing
about whether such experiences are all in the heads of the people having
them, or represent actual interactions with the outside world!  Your
terminology sheds no new light on this debate.  Do you think people will
now accept that their experiences are all in their heads simply because
you have labelled them "spiritual"?  It is far more likely that they will
tell you that you have misunderstood the nature of what they are
experiencing.

I don't believe in zombies.  The idea that someone can behave just like
a human being, argue passionately that he *is* conscious, that he does
have internal experiences, that he loves life and treasures every moment

You ought to read some of the philosophical arguments against the existence
of zombies.  David Chalmers has some good stuff on his web page.  (I don't
agree with Chalmers on some issues, but his arguments against zombies are
good.)

One example is Chalmer's "fading qualia", from
http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/qualia.html.  Imagine your brain
gradually being replaced, a bit at a time, with electronic circuitry which
mimics the neural functions.  Zombie lovers might suggest that at the end
you have no consciousness, although you continue to act just the same.
Now imagine what it would feel like to undergo this transformation.
Presumably at some point you have a "faded" sense of consciousness;
you are part way to being a zombie, but not all the way there.  Yet you
continue to act just the same, and claim that the intensity of your
sense of self has not changed at all.  How can you rationalize this
inaccuracy?

I just think it's confusing.  You are taking a term with an established
set of meanings and using it in a different way.  This will not further
the cause of enlightened discussion.

I should add that I am tired of people claiming that we fear or react
defensively to these terms.  That's just an attempt to argue by
intimidation, and I find it rude.

This must be pure, morphogenetic, mythical synchronicity at work. Have
been thinking about this for days. While archetypal red herring, consider
the GEP -- Global Extropian Party (hey, even the Natural Law guys have
managed this). 

I freely admit this being the fringe de la fringe, but why not giving it a

However, the uploaded world will be a cartoon world, with no link to the
physical.  It will be even less real than the 'spiritual' stuff you talk of.
 None of the entities in the uploaded world would be seperate, nor would they
be real.  They would be cartoon sets of abstract rules made to look like us!

This is a cheap, New Age description to me because it provides
absolutely no useful information about how such a form of existence
functions or how to attain it. Energy is much too simplistic a
description of something as complex as life, knowledge and experience. 

Your earlier statements about wanting to fly like an eagle or
experience the sensations of other creatures seem inconsistent: One
the one hand you say, "matter-bound existence seriously limits the
quality and quantity of experience gathering", and then you talk about
"instilling my matter-emancipated consciousness into other physical
manifestations and assimilating the knowing of  the experience into
my being."  The question is, what is this "being"? Calling it "energy"
just doesnt cut it for me. 

Perhaps you are really just unsatisfied with your current physical
manifestation and want to experience others, not abandon physical
manifestations altogether.  I think this is what we all want, but I
dont think that talking wistfully about "energy forms" is going to
get you there!

As Anders said:
< We need to be embodied in some sense to have experiences, to be able
to grow.>

Or, perhaps you feel that the you you experience in dreaming, or
during meditative and psychedelic experiences, is this "lighter energy
form" AND it is ALREADY your PRIMARY being. For example, Terence
McKenna has suggested:

< the dream is a higher-order spatial dimension. In sleep one is
released into the real world of which the world of waking is only the
surface in a very literal geometrical sense ... We are not primarily
biological, with mind emerging as a kind of iridescence, a kind of
epiphenomenon at the higher levels of organization of biology. We are,
in fact, hyperspatial objects of some sort which cast a shadow into
matter. The shadow in matter is our physical organism.>

Even if this is true, and I dont think it is (biology comes first
IMO), its still an inadequate description for achieving that state
even psychically, let alone in some permanent physical way.

I find it interesting to note that Catholic theologians distinguish
"four properties of the resurrected body: Incapability of suffering
(also called IMPASSIBILITY), meaning that we will no longer suffer
physical evils such as sorrow, sickness or death; SUBTILITY, meaning
that we will have a spiritualized nature, in the sense of a spiritual
body ... AGILITY, meaning that the body will obey the soul with the
greatest of ease and speed of movement; and CLARITY, meaning that the
body will be free from any deformity and will be filled with beauty
and radiance." 

Inadequate as this is, it is still a much more functional and
prescriptive description of what you seem to be seeking than "lighter
energy form".  (It might even have some applicability for how virtual
beings would navigate in cyberspace.) Its also interesting how
similar these properties are to the four 'Gates of Dreaming' that
Carlos Casteneda describes in his 1993 book, _The Art of Dreaming_,
but I wont go into that (some possibly practical exercises but still
too much mushy talk about energy bodies).

If you really do believe this, that you are already this energy body
and it is primary, then you really have nothing to worry about: once
your current physical manifestation dies, your soul will just move
on to another level of existence.  No need to do anything special in
this world except keep your karma clean! (so that you dont come
back as a cockroach, for example, instead of an eagle ;-)

It's a convenient device of language to think of it that way, but one

...like that.  Good and bad only exist where there is an agent of
conscious choice, and genes are not conscious.  Their "selfishness"
is simply a way to describe the effect of replication in terms that
make some phenomena easier to understand.  But the effect itself is
merely an after-the-fact effect of whatever changes happen to occur.
A gene can't judge ahead of time what would be good or bad; they
simply are what they are, change when they change, and the ones left
standing are here because they /were/ good for the environment in
which they replicated.  In the case of most higher animals on Earth,
the first ones probably had no use for death, but by chance, one
happened to mutate into a form that died, and that one was more
successful at reproducing than those who didn't /in the environment
of that time/, because spending limited resources on older beings--
perhaps with too many copying errors in their DNA or some other
fitness problem--was more costly than simply killing them off and
saving those resources for younger breeders.

It is quite possible that a species similar to Homo Sapiens, but
immortal, would be successful in today's environment.  But unless
that mutation actually happens, and the two forms compete for
a few millenia, there's no reason for it to happen.  "If it ain't
broke, don't fix it" is a popular principle of evolution.

> If, indeed, a gene that codes for extra longevity is an advantage, why

Again, the point of view is backward.  The question is, since
longevity isn't the current state of affairs, why was it selected
against (if it ever existed in the first place)?

 How many top notch antibiotics from just a few years ago are now
considered worthless? There is a new predator in this "human dominated
ecosystem" and you can't even see it. Unless the population pressure is
released by space colonization, our overburdening of the ecosystem will
be our own demise. Since the ecosystem is our life support system on
spaceship earth, claiming that its demise would not endanger us is like
claiming you can shut off oxygen in the space shuttle and expect to live
more than a few hours.... Don't get me wrong, I still think we will
survive, but it will wind up becoming a VERY near thing, so much so that
we will have a minimum of several decades to as much as a century of
work to repair the damage once we've "graduated".

SUre but if you have even a few percent of the market responding to the
same signals at the same time, you'll get a cascade reaction. People
using the Motley Fools' Dow Dividend Theory of buying the five lowest
priced dow stocks at th beginning of each year leads to large selloff
pressures at the end of the year on that year's performers....

If Green is 'real', then could you perhaps point it out to me? I find

But you just said that Green is something real, now you seem to be
reversing that claim to say that Green is indeed merely a tag inside our
heads.

No, they reject it because they believe that there's something 'spiritual'
inside themselves because that's what everyone's told them.

Then what is it? You seem to be reversing your opinion again.

I for one don't fear it, I just find it pointless because it tells us
absolutely nothing new. Treating the brain as a computer explains the vast
majority of our observations about human behaviour. We don't need to 
bring 'spirits' into this.

Mark Grant said my argument about the genetic basis of senescence
sounds circular, but then presents "Dawkins' explanation", which
Dawkins himself credits to Sir Peter Medawar, G. C. Williams, and
W. D. Hamilton. This is exactly the explanation that I was trying
to present, but I guess I did a poor job of it.

Rather than repeat my mistakes, I'll give a bibliographic cite to
a widely available book (by Dawkins), written at a popular level:
RIVER OUT OF EDEN, ISBN 0-465-01606-5, pp 128-133. Interestingly
enough, Dawkins chooses to present this explanation at the end of
the last chapter of the book.

This is a curious claim. Why do you think that uploads will not keep their
sensorics and motorics, or design even better sensorics and motorics for
even richer interaction with the physical world than we are capable of?

Due to the availability of information, anonymity and ability to do business
on demand, I expect successful companies consisting of teenagers and young
adults to become commonplace.  Children that are recieving a better education
than we ever did (due to the availability of information) will have newer,
more original ideas and will stand a better chance in the fast paced digital
economy.  I expect most of todays companies will not be able to survive the
dramatic changes ahead.  Large companies will split into smaller, more
malleable parts.

The problem with that thesus is that the state does not actually
interfere in economic development. As anyone with a degree or two and
meaningful experience in public administration and public policy can
tell you (if they're honest), economic policy is usually developed by
the special interest groups and lobbys that have the financial ability
and desire to get those members of congress elected who they can then
influence via funds (see bribes?)for their re-election. As a quid pro
quo the special interests get what they pay for. 

To a great extent democracy is an illusion under our present campaign
financing system.
The disillusionment of many members of the public toward indirect
representation as it has evolved is possibly one of the reasons for the
advance of the libertarian as well as the right wing "conservative"
movement. Both seem to want to reject the status quo. Their approaches
to the problems in our evolving system seem quite different but I
believe that they are more similar than they would like to acknowledge.

Ultimately, as our minds, cultures, societies and other other tangable
and intangable systems continue to evolve, I suspect that we will
eventually develop the wherewithall to engage in some form of
participatory democracy based on our individual and combined knowledge,
skills and abilities. In such a scheme the criteria for public
representation will (hopefully) be competency based.

	Actually, that is probably wrong.  A person can affect the survival of
their genes after reproducing by assisting the young.  Menopause actually
occurs regularly in primitive human societies (in other words, women live
that long).  Fertility is already in decline by that period (probably due
to other agents already discussed) so being able to give birth would not
result in a great success for the genes.  Keeping the elder females around
to help with gathering (they are at least as efficient and sometimes more
so than their younger counterparts, possibly because those of reproductive
age try to reserve energy for reproduction) and to store knowledge does
help the genes.  Keep in mind that in a tribe most people are related.  It
is a fallacy to think that genes don't "care" about a person after they
have reproduced.  Genes care about a person as long as the existence of
that person is a benefit to the genes.

For anyone who's interested in a less compressed version, I'm posting a
four-part summary drawn from the end of my book.  All the italics will drop
out, alas, and probably some of the formatting. =20

[I ask that none of this essay be quoted or reproduced beyond the extropian
list, as it is still awaiting publication in an Australian magazine.]

	RE-CYCLING THE ZEITGEIST
=09

	i

What if history isn't arbitrary, isn't just a blind jostling of power and
knowledge-claims?  What if human action and discourse track a kind of
Zeitgeist weather cycle, periodic seasons that bias the `spirit of the
times'?  During the last half-century, such questions were rarely raised
but suddenly they're cropping up again - as they do, from time to time.

Between the World Wars, Czech semioticians Jan Mukarovsky and Roman
Jakobson noticed that the arts of distinct eras seem to be governed by
different `dominants'.  Here's a simple, if obscure, example: in Czech
Realist poetry of the second half of the nineteenth century, Jakobson
noted, `rhythm was a dispensable device, whereas the syllabic scheme was a
mandatory, inalienable component, without which verse was not verse'. =20

For Jakobson, the dominant was the focusing component of an art work, the
aspect that `rules, determines and transforms the remaining components'.
It did not supplant or erase every other aspect of the work, of course, but
it steered creativity through a particular favoured channel.  More than 60
years ago, he saw that `we may seek a dominant not only in the poetic work
of an individual,' or the canon of a school, `but also in the art of a
given epoch, viewed as a particular whole.'  During the Renaissance, visual
arts became the typical aesthetic criteria, as music did under Romanticism.
 In Realist aesthetics, the dominant art was verbal.

Jakobson also proposed a model for any communication process. Its circuit
held six components, somewhat oversimplified and one-dimensional, but
forming a neat flowchart.  A Sender exchanges a Message with the Receiver
(or addressee) about some aspect of their shared World, written in a common
Code and transmitted through an error-correcting, reliable Channel. =20

This brutally reduced analysis can be critiqued, deconstructed and
reassembled, but it stands up pretty well once you see that there's always
a flow back-and-forth between writer and reader.  So it's not just a
one-way imposition of Authority, from active to passive. =20

Put these two Jakobson ideas together - dominant and communication circuit
- and something strangely illuminating occurs.  The history of writing,
according to literary critic Christine Brooke-Rose, can be seen as an
itinerary `round and round the Jakobson diagram'.  If I'm right, that's
true for the philosophy of science as well.

Strikingly, the six communication components are themselves large-scale
dominants, which have regulated the flow of ideas in the last six centuries
- and perhaps much longer.  These large-scale dominants seem to orchestrate
a grand waltz of ruling discourses from one generation to its successor.
Call them, handily, We (addressee), I (sender), It (world), Text or Theory
(message), Language (code), and Rule or Algorithm (channel).

Dominant literary and artistic schools have lingered at one node or another
for a decade, a generation or even longer (an Augustan Age, a Belle
=C9poche), only to move on inevitably in a new leap to a predictable point o=
n
the diagram.  Science, too, passes from an emphasis on the inspired, to the
empirical, to the theoretical, the coded, and the `cook-book' or=
 algorithmic.

In my new book Theory and Its Discontents, I propose a kind of discursive
Theory of Everything, which plots a cyclical sequence of six phases or
dominants (drawn from the Jakobson communication circuit) in the histories
of both the humanities and the sciences.  It's quite a shocking thought, of
course.  What could control or impose such a fixed sequence of dominants?
Let me sketch a cartoon of my lengthy argument.

Two obvious sites to look for the primary script of such a
multi-generational round are both located in human evolutionary biology.
The first is the generations of history.  Could human chronicles form
chapters of a regular length, so to speak?  The second is the succession of
stages of each individual's life.  Might the life-cycle sequence somehow
merge and control the diverse ingredients of that narrative hubbub we call
history?  Those are quite different questions from the discredited
historicisms of Hegel or Marx.

There's a simple way to test these possibilities - try to see if we can
parse history, or life-span, into analogues of the six Jakobson nodes.  Yet
if certain fairly simple biological and discursive tides might carry us in
their flow, don't we slip into some inadvertently blackly comic horror of
reductionism?  Such patterns, if any are discernible, will bear the same
distanced relation to thick reality as Galileo's frictionless planes bear
to an experimental surface of grained wood.

I've just finished reading Dave Chalmer's book The Conscious Mind, which
left me wondering exactly *what* he *is* saying... but I think you've got
it turned around, Hal.  Chalmers' argument for the singular and unreductive
character of consciousness is based firmly on the feasibility of
counterfactual possible worlds which are replete with zombies.  These
critters are identical with us down the quantal level, but lack the
supervenience of consciousness and hence lack `experience' and `qualia' -
even though they claim to have them (being perfect behavioural emulations
of conscious people).  Certainly Dave argues against *us* being zombies -
he rejects the John Clark model, in other words - but his whole argument
hangs on the modal possibility that a zombie world *is* intelligible.  I
don't think it is, in rather the way I don't think it's genuinely possible
to ask the hoary old question `why is there anything rather than nothing?'
I don't think we *can* conceive of the absence of literally *everything*,
just of the absence of certain structures.  The rest is just words,
free-floating and (in such cases) delusive signifiers.

Let's leave in abeyance the question of `historical phases' and
`discontinuities', and turn to the second possible schema governing this
cycle of dominants.  Consider the metaphor of an individual human's passage
(as mapped by Jean Piaget and other developmental specialists) from infancy
to death.  Might this genetically hardwired sequence provide insight into
cultural patterns of growth and decay - if indeed there really are any such
regularities, the kinds alleged by enthusiasts for long cycles of
historical recurrence?

It might seem that even so `genealogical' a metaphor must offend against
contemporary taste, insinuating a determinism repugnant to our
sensibilities, one especially distasteful to today's heightened awareness
of contingency and the non-linearities of complexity theory.  To a
generation of poststructuralists attuned to Michel Foucault's strictures on
dispersed, `micro-power' vectors in preference to centralising,
`macro-power', any apparently organicist metaphor must look preposterous.  

Is there any reason to suppose that the shape of our lives (let alone our
cognitive structures) is segmented beyond, say, age 14 or 16?  I think
there is.  Confucius, in the fifth century BC, offered a celebrated
partitioning that is still resonant: `At 15 I set my heart on learning; at
30 I was firmly established; at 40 I had no more doubts; at 50 I knew the
will of Heaven; at 60 I was ready to listen to it; at 70 I could follow my
heart's desire without transgression.'

So let us split up a notional 20th century Western lifetime into somewhat
arbitrary but not absurd sectors of 12.5 years.  What's more, I will code
these according to the Jakobson schema.

>From birth to 12.5: early construction of the social self, peaking at
puberty.  Establishing communication channels, seguing into addressee as
social self (Algorithm-to-We).

12.5 to 25: the construction of the addresser's individual self, peaking at
the establishment of early parental role (I). 

25 to 37.5: emphasis shifting away from individual subjectivity toward
confident dealings with, especially exploration of, the large-scale `real'
or objective world (It). 

37.5 to 50: the `writing' of message into the world, peaking with one's
children rearing their own first children (Text/Theory).  

50 to 62.5: consolidated mastery of the codes of culture and world alike,
peaking with the shift from specific competences to supervisory roles and
preparation for retirement (Code). 

62.5 to 75: mature settling into `elder' role, custodian of the mores and
channels of social order, and preparation for death (Algorithm). 

Posit that this developmental history reflects a flexible genetic/cultural
clock regulating individual development with some robustness across many
cultures.  Clearly, this is likely to have altered in an unprecedented
degree during the 20th century, when its later phases became stretched out
by our own high-tech medical culture, with delayed or extended
child-rearing, healthy maturity, and senescence.  Still, it is feasible
that such a grand template might be assimilated and rehearsed in broad
cultural shifts of Jakobsonian Dominant (within, of course, the limits of
each bounded culture or civilisation).  

Is such a weather cycle of discourse feasible?  Climatic phases might be
recurrent, but aren't we humans set free of biology, children of
self-reflexive, infinitely mutable culture?  While a naturalist such as E.
O. Wilson might hope to draw broad sociobiological lessons from animal
behaviour and the laws of Darwinism, these days it is generally regarded as
an illicit move within the humane specialties.  The fashion in human
studies is `thick description', empathetic immersion in local ways.  Global
grand theories of social structure and change are routinely rejected as
misguided and simplistic.  

The case is not, however, so simply dismissed.  Anthropologist Ernest
Gellner notes: `Most pre-scientific societies... build up a tolerably
coherent world-picture, in which background world-story, social
organization, and natural fact are all congruent.  The time-ordering
sub-system will tend to dovetail in with the personal hierarchy sub-system:
the big periodic festival, marking the seasonal rhythm, also underwrites
the hieratic rankings' (Plough, Sword and Book: the Structure of Human
History).  Given this traditional interlock, it would be unsurprising if
the palpably biological stages of individual developmental were folded into
the grander seasons of a society's ebbs and flows.  

Of course, each year brings new births and deaths, so one might wonder how
a universal such as the developmental cycle might be registered (prior to
the epoch of great punctuating global wars) against the continuum of
history.  Hunter-gatherers will indeed tend to blur time into timelessness,
interrupted chiefly by random natural catastrophes or rich years,
time-bonded by the round of annual liturgies.  

Once civil society has precipitated, however, the clock tends to be set by
the accession of chiefs, kings, or perhaps high priests or prophets and
external conquerors.  Although somewhat discontinuous, these in turn will
tend to follow the generational unfolding of a healthy human family (since
kings and priests live well, if spared in battle).  Ecology itself can
provide a calibration mechanism, chiefly through shifts in the prevalence
of game or agricultural produce.  We are biologically adapted to such
roughly boom-and-bust dietary cycles.  

Well, might the `life-span' sequence map the stages of historical change
within a limited cultural trajectory?  Where one comparatively recent
Western discursive phase, say, favoured the `I' node (romanticism), another
found its expression principally as Text/Theory (modernism in painting and
literature/ relativity/ quantum theory), yet another within Code (the
structuralist dominant/ DNA decoding/ particle physics)...  

We tend to assume that such aggregations are either accidental, or emerge
in response to internal pressures from within the disciplines themselves.
Might we wonder if, instead, such discursive dominants - though hardly the
content of their exact formulations - follow each another according to a
certain predictable order, and for a certain term?

The typical time-span, or window of opportunity, for such cultural
modulations is the generation of perhaps 27 or 25 years (hence the 12.5 /25
/50 year chunking in my developmental sketch).  This is akin to Fernand
Braudel's famous conjonctures and Modelski's global phases.  A child of
1890 is a member of the effectual generation 1915-40, and a `baby boomer'
of 1945 will be crucially positioned for consequential collective action
(or opposition) from about 1970 onward - although active opposition to
racism or the Vietnam War, for example, brought this date forward for a
large minority of boomers.

Postulate, then, that each of my six discursive nodes corresponds to a
period of 50 years.  Very roughly, the first of two coupled generations
will see a Dominant rise, while the successor will see it at first
consolidated, and then in decline.  This procession, if nothing intervenes
to compress or stretch it out, would yield a historical cycle (for the West
in the previous millennium, at least) some 300 years long.=20

Consider a sequence of six `cultural dominants' in the West from, say, 1700
through the zero year 1850 to 2000, then starting again (and for the 300
years prior to 1700, at least).  They alternate in the manner of Modelskian
double phases, thus:

	1700-1724-1749: Phatic/aristocracy/local loyalties/poor schooling
	1750-1774-1799: `We'/absolutism/Classicism (Augustan literature)
	1800-1824-1849: `I'/anticlerical/Romanticism ([Michelangelo], Byron)
	1850-1874-1899: `IT'/scientific empiricism/empire ([Shakespeare])
	1900-1924-1949: Text/unstable absolutism ([30 Years War], WWs I&II)
	1950-1974-1999: Code/oligarchical representative democracies
	{2000-2024-2049: Phatic/Postmodern and post-industrial fragmentation}

This narrative is not to be taken as describing anything so lawful and
regular as the gravitational orbits of planets about their sun.  It
resembles more the apparent modulation of climate as the sun's energy
output waxes and wanes through its 22-year-long sunspot cycle, or over
millennia as the earth tilts and wobbles on its axis. =20

The proposed clock, or cyclical calendar, notates the transition from one
Dominant to another, and perhaps incorporates an alternation in styles of
informational regimes from `top-down' to `bottom-up' and back again.
Forerunners may unconsciously anticipate its urgings by a decade or more,
while the collectivity tends to lag another decade behind the cultural
standard-bearers.  This communal sluggishness might be dubbed `Zeitgeist
inertia'.=20

The birth-dates of a given dominant's first generation cluster within the
second or consolidatory generation of its predecessor.  Thus its early
exemplars will reach vigorous maturity at around age 25, their entrained
children 25 years after that; they will be preparing for death in their
mid-seventies (and perhaps disseminating their old-fashioned wisdom to
whomever will listen) as the next dominant surges toward hegemony.

Consider more precise cases.  On my suggested Jakobson schema, the children
cyclically entrained to articulate and exhibit the most recent `I' or
`ADDRESSER' dominant were born around 1774, and first acted decisively (as
their peer Napoleon did) around the turn of the nineteenth century, the
birth of Romanticism. =20

The second generation of the `IT' or `WORLD' modality were young adults
from around 1874, and children born at that time might be expected to
cultivate a new modality centring on `TEXT' or `THEORY'.  Notable (male)
births of that era were Albert Einstein (b.1879), Pablo Picasso (b.1881),
James Joyce (b.1882), who came of age in the phase doomed to global war.=20

Children born around 1924 were raised - if the model is correct - by
parents steeped in that previous theoretical practice, and might be
expected to re-shape the world according to the dominance of `CODE': James
Watson of DNA double-helix fame was b.1928; Murray Gell-Mann, who uncovered
the nuclear structure coded as quarks and leptons, was b.1929. =20

Similarly, the first generation of culture-bearers governed by the `CODE'
dominant was active between, roughly, 1949 and 1974 - the period of
structuralism, the civil rights and anti-war revolts in the USA - and we
are now drawing toward the close of its second generation.  Those children
from around 1949, the `baby boomers', are predicted by the model as peaking
in this second `CODE' generation: Chris Langton, inventor of `artificial
life' literally coded in computer programs, was b.1948; Kathy Acker and
Martin Amis, whose postmodern novels scarifyingly deploy semiotic
transforms of their fin de si=E8cle urban landscapes, were b.1948 and 1949. =
 =20

Nor is it surprising that the stirrings of the next, or `PHATIC/
ALGORITHMIC', dominant have been pervasive in avant-garde postmodern and
infobahn textuality of every kind.  It is a prediction of this model that
the channel-oriented, the algorithmic, the generic will command the first
25 or 50 years of the new millennium.  Such emphases on rule, rote and
formulae work both for good and ill, creatively expressed as computerised
virtual realities and stultifyingly as media pap.  There will be resurgent
local loyalties (something we are seeing already, often marked by blood),
with routinised work or none at all.

Is the theory strictly testable?  One can run the model backwards in an
attempt to retrodict the science and arts of the last two great cycles, as
well as forward.  It is intriguing that Immanuel Kant was b.1724, near the
second peak of the most recent `PHATIC' or `ALGORITHMIC' dominant, and
matured during the first peak of the `WE' or `ADDRESSEE' generation,
suitably enough for the great philosopher of the categorical imperative.
The first generation of the `I' or `ADDRESSER' generation peaked in 1800:
they include William Wordsworth (b.1770), engineer Isambard Brunel
(b.1769).  Mary Shelley (b.1797) represents the second generation
emphasising the `ADDRESSER' node; Frankenstein epitomises both Gothic
exultation and unease at Promethean subjectivity, and a dread of the
forceful new empiricism (`IT' phase) beyond the next generational horizon. =
=20

Such `generations' are hardly so tidy, of course.  Darwin (b.1809) and Marx
(b.1818) matured during the early Romantic phase of the `ADDRESSER' but
were influential on the emerging first generation devoted to the `WORLD' or
`IT' dominant. Physicist Lord Kelvin and brain surgeon Paul Broca,
impeccable explorers of the empirical world, were both b.1824, on the
rising trajectory into imperial vigour.  Composer Edward Elgar (b.1857)
appeared at an appropriate time to be `programmed' as the pre-eminent
British laureate of empirical empire's second or melancholy phase.  But no
list of confirming instances can `prove' the utility or validity of such a
schema, of course, as any Popperian will remind us, and evaluation is
perhaps finally a matter of aesthetic choice.

Stipulating for argument's sake that this schema is broadly valid, how
would any given cultural Dominant impact on the `internalist' dynamics of
various scientific and artistic practice?  These are themselves parsed by
their different emphases on the six Jakobson nodes. =20

One might speculate that something akin to harmonic reinforcement and
extinction might apply: in a Code-driven cycle-phase like the second half
of the twentieth century, versions of practice dependent upon coding and a
co-ordinated community of practitioners will tend to attract attention,
gain political support, feel `in tune' with the mood of the age.  Varieties
less consistent with the pre-eminence of Code and Addressee - specifically,
those accenting the romantic Addresser, and repudiating genre and algorithm
while turning aside somewhat from the urgencies of the given world - will
fail to flourish.  Presumably similar effects will be generated by
reinforcement and interference with recurrent global political and economic
power struggles mapped by Modelski's long cycles of a century's duration.

What the cyclical Jakobson schema predicts for our own global culture is
consistent with a balkanised western/post-soviet world early next century,
followed by two generations of imposed `imperial' stability after a new and
terrible global contest for leadership.  A restless upsurge of utopian New
Romanticism might be expected in the early 22nd century. =20

Of course, discontinuous advances in technology might change all this in a
stroke, or by a series of utterly unpredictable ruptures.  Self-replicating
nanotechnology, and human-level (or superhuman!) artificial intelligence,
will have a profound influence on almost everything human culture has
accepted as givens to this point.  Major advances in genetic engineering,
including such singularities as optional abolition of death, might be even
more unsettling.  At worst, global ecological collapse or uncontrolled
warfare based on ethno-specific or age-specific designer viruses would
interrupt the ticking of the most ancient and embedded clocks.  (I explore
these disruptive possibilities in my forthcoming book The Spike:
Accelerating into the Unimaginable Future.)

Despite the much-vaunted re-discovery of `the body' by some poststructural
thinkers, current Francophile theory is still reluctant to take seriously
the fact that humans are animals evolved through millions of years at the
edge of starvation.  It is not impossible that our proudest cultural
efflorescences are fractal foam on the rushing and retreating edges of the
combers of deep evolutionary tides, especially the genetic drives for
sustenance and procreation inflected by local circumstances.

For Walter Benjamin, in a lovely and glacial epigram, history was an angel
flying backward into the future.  I propose (if less beautifully, less
terribly) that culture - our engaged histories - is a squabbling group of
humans making our way steadily forward in a riverrun ascent, a path with no
single destination, a re-entrant spiral at once concealed and hauntingly
familiar, known to us in the discursive and somatic memories of five or ten
thousand generations of voyagers, sceptics, storytellers.

>From time to time, efforts have been made to identify broad series of human
behaviours and match them against climatic oscillations.  Between the world
wars, two notable research efforts were undertaken by a geographer and a
historian whose names are now altogether forgotten (unlike Spengler's, say,
who is remembered even if nobody reads his books).  These studies
emphasised the ethological impact of climatic variety on human groups
living at distinctly different times and places.

Ellsworth Huntington was an explorer, research associate at the Carnegie
Institution, and Yale professor whose books ranged from Civilization and
Climate (1915) to his magnum opus, Mainsprings of Civilization (1945),
published two years before his death.  His thesis of strong climatic
determinism strikes us today as crankily ethnocentric at best, for he
sought to discover why `vigorous' peoples like wealthy Euro-Americans were
so much more successful than the `indolent', `feminised' races nearer the
equator or otherwise trapped and stultified by debilitating circumstances.
In the era of the Asian Tigers on the Pacific Rim, not to mention the
historic defeat of American military efforts by tropical Vietnamese, this
claim is now obviously not just racist but ludicrous. =20

We should not be entirely distracted, however, by our legitimate distaste
for colonial premises and rhetoric.  A comprehensive current treatment of
the coevolution of climate and life by Stephen H. Schneider and Randi
Londer notes that `Huntington's views neglect the complex interactions
among environmental and social factors influencing history.  They led to a
backlash of social criticism, which perhaps overreacted by totally denying
any significant component of climatic impact on human affairs.  In reality,
though, most case studies reveal that climate and society are so
intertwined that it is difficult to separate the societal impact from the
climate factor.'

Difficult, but perhaps not out of the question.  Huntington's comparative
ethnography, usefully categorised, remains a rich trove of data on
historical and environmental flows in the fortunes of nations. =20

Raymond H. Wheeler, a former psychology professor at the University of
Kansas, shared Huntington's interest in weather cycles, constructing his
own grand theory of cultural recurrence.  Around the middle of the 20th
century, Wheeler orchestrated a massive research project, drawing on up to
two hundred co-workers, to reduce all of recorded history to coherent
summary form.  As the data from 2500 years of records were tabulated, he
discerned a number of recurrent patterns world-wide. =20

The most notable was a roughly 100-year climatic cycle, varying between 70
and 120 years, which seemed to fall into four predictable phases.  From
this periodicity, and drawing on then-prevalent doctrines of cultural and
ethnic character, he theorised a regular swing of mass psychological
emphasis between `classical' or `centralist' and `romantic' or
`individualist' styles of community and culture.

Obviously these climate-driven distinctions cannot be found literally
everywhere simultaneously, because a global shift like the El Ni=F1o
vacillation will bring unusually abundant rain to one region while filching
it from another.  Still, events like the Maunder sunspot Minimum during the
17th century (coinciding with Europe's `Little Ice Age') suggest that at
least some secular climatic variations on the order of a century can be due
to changes in the sun's energy output.  And since available sunlight fuels
all life on the planet, it also drives reproduction dynamics.

Wheeler and his team found their data was usefully schematised by a
four-fold sequence of roughly 25-year-long `seasons': Warm-Wet, Warm-Dry,
Cold-Wet, and Cold-Dry.  Each contributed to a certain characteristic mode
of collective behaviour, so that, according to cycle enthusiasts Edward
Dewey and Og Mandino, `similar events have occurred throughout history
during the same phases of the 100-year climate cycle'.=20

As part of their project, Wheeler and his staff drew up comprehensive
weighted lists of International War Battles and Civil War Battles.  These
clustered according to climatic indices.  Drought and civil war recurred at
approximately 170-year intervals, with a notable shorter cycle of
approximately twenty-three years.=20

Clearly, what's needed is a theoretical perspective able to bind together
the empirical evidence for historical recurrences, and organise them into a
schema of some robustness.  Although models of this kind have been
academically unpopular for at least the last quarter century, or perhaps
for the last fifty years, they are hardly new to historiography and social
theory.  Aristotle's Politics posited six versions or perhaps phases of
constitution: Monarchy (rule by the virtuous chieftain), Tyranny (its
corrupt deviation), Aristocracy (the rule of `the best'), Oligarchy (its
deviation, with the rich in command), Polity (representative democracy of
the citizens), and Democracy (its deviation, mob rule). =20

Polybius, in the second century BC, employed an `internalist' explanation
for the decay of states: anacyclosis, the circular regime path from rule by
kings, to aristocrats, to the citizenry, and back to kings.  Nearly two
thousand years later, Giambattista Vico proposed a `New Science', or
universal model for historical recurrence.  It followed a loop from an
original bestial condition, through a rule of superstition (the age of the
gods), to clan leadership and aristocracy (the age of heroes), and plebeian
equality (the age of men) - perhaps culminating in a new regime of
bestiality founded in new technologies.

Perhaps the nearest non-Marxist contemporary scholarship comes to such
templates is the `long cycle' advanced a decade ago by George Modelski and
William R. Thompson, specialists in international relations.  This
discipline is the theorised offspring of a somewhat exhausted older style,
diplomatic history, formerly given over to an obsessional empiricism of
daily events co-ordinated by doctrines such as Balance of Power.  Modelski,
by refreshing contrast, merges the benefits of rich empirical research with
a sociological account of group action, proposing a grand theory of
political recurrences.  Its outcome proves to be not altogether unlike
Wheeler's `externalist' climatic model, except that this schema is driven
by `internal' motors: the fourfold systems-theory requirements of
adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latent pattern-maintenance. =
=20

Perhaps surprisingly, it yields a familiar portrait, only now on a global
scale.  If Modelski is correct, since 1494 the world system has passed
through five `long cycles', each with four generational phases.  The cycles
run a little more than a century each, and climax in devastating contests
for world leadership.  These global conflicts last between 23 and 31 years,
with the same average as the cycle generation, 27 years.  We are now living
through the exhausted stage of an American century, and, if no better and
more humane means is devised for adjudicating leadership, the world is
probably doomed to a new global war in perhaps 2030 (but not until then).

Modelski's complex, tightly-argued claim for this parsing of the last
half-millennium into repetitive centuries is by no means timid, and
deserves to be cited at some length:

	The long cycle of global politics is the major rhythm of the modern world;
its mechanism is the regulatory process or negative feedback.  Other
systems and sub-systems might have their own distinctive regularities and
repetitions but the long cycle's is assuredly most visible, with its
product, the succession of world powers, a glittering, if perhaps
vainglorious, pageant.

	As a rhythm the long cycle is not a merely mechanical process of
regulation and control.  It is in fact more akin to a heartbeat, suggestive
of the pulsations of a living, growing system, one capable of renewal, even
self-correction, one that goes beyond the dimension of biological time into
that of social time, the spacing of the social processes by the rites of
passage of the world system.  The major event clusters of the cycle... make
up the rituals of world politics.  They are the key markers of world time.
(Long Cycles in World Politics) =20

Modelski's narrative deals only with the global political system.
Discursive regimes might well follow a more protracted pulse than the long
cycle, but consistent with its punctuations.

The regulation of world order, for Modelski, is a double feedback process
blending stability and development.  While his version of grand theory
inevitably stresses homeostasis - the systemic mechanism for keeping things
on an even keel - it also makes learning a central theme.  Long cycles
might track a common schema, but they do not return to the same place.
Development and radical change are inevitable, especially technological
change - the sheer accumulated amount of information and augmented human
capacity to affect our world.

The four phases of each long cycle switch between order and disorder.  In
cycle phase 1, preference for order in the global system is high, but its
availability is low; this generation wages global war.  In phase 2,
preference for order remains high, and, due to the decisive close of the
previous phase, available order is now high as well, leading to a regime of
world order.  In phase 3, preference for order has fallen to low, despite
its prevalent and perhaps oppressively high availability, so a regime of
delegitimation sets in for a generation.  Finally, both preference for
order and its availability are low, so deconcentration brings new hegemonic
challenge to the boil -- preparing the way for a return to the start of the
long cycle.  It is arresting to compare this schema with Wheeler's fourfold
categorisation, where WARM/DRY matches Modelski's global war phase, and the
remainder march in close agreement.

Of course, the diplomatic long cycle schema was not developed to explain
biological or even economic pacemakers such as climate. It emerges from
study of the historical narrative, today usually regarded as radically
contingent.  Yet while its roster of players is determined by sensitive
dependence upon initial conditions - and hence to some considerable degree
remains unpredictable - the general orbit envelope of the attractor (to
borrow the terminology of chaos theory) is quite predictable. =20

The major wars of these five great sequences are given as the Portuguese
cycle, with its ceaseless Italian and Indian Ocean wars of 1494-1516; the
Dutch cycle, with the Spanish-Dutch war of 1580-1609; the first British
cycle, with the wars of Louis XIV, 1688-1713; the second British cycle,
with the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon, 1792-1815; and the
American cycle, or wars with Germany, 1914-45. =20

Interestingly, Modelski's late '80s attempt to forecast this pattern into
the next millennium immediately went awry (along with almost everyone
else's) by assuming that the principal challenger to American suzerainty in
1973-2030 would be the Soviet Union.  Presumably the slot would be filled
now by Japan, or perhaps Unified Europe, or the Asia-Pacific Tigers. =20

Perhaps the most striking feature of this century-long process is the role
played by massive conflict, or more exactly its successful conclusion, as a
definitive time-marker.  Whether or not the long cycle is calibrated to
more primitive pulses (physiologic, ecological, even solar), one can set
its clock by the celebrations that mark global armistice. =20

Arnold Toynbee famously found in this unhappy recurrence a key to
alternations between war and peace: `the survivors of a generation that has
been of military age during a bout of war will be shy, for the rest of
their lives, of bringing a repetition of this tragic experience either upon
themselves or their children' (A Study of History, Vol. IX). Perhaps the
uniformity of experience shared by those children (in our own recent
history, the `baby boomers') is at least as salient as that of their
warrior parents.=20

(For some of you this is a second announcement - 
because it was not quite so definite before.)

I'm losing two rentmates at end of June.  If you've been to a 
"Free Exchange" you know the place.  (Now picture it without chairs.)

It's a comfortable flat in northwest San Francisco, 
well lit, airy, cool, near Golden Gate Park and the ocean.  
Garage (one space), laundry.
One of the nearly-departed used the dining-ell for an office.

Present occupant (me) has varied interests, mild (but not monotonous) 
taste in music, and a sense of humor which some find cryptic.

$450, plus $50 for whoever uses the garage.  
Nonsmokers required (by landlord as well as me), book-lovers preferred.

Please pass the word.

Several, but antibiotics aren't necessary for human survival.  If they fail
(which is not yet clear) the death rate goes up a bit and we have to be more
careful about public health measures.  But, overall, we'll do fine.  Epidemic
diseases are anything but new.  Also, there are methods for controlling bugs
other than antibiotics which we kind of tossed aside when antibiotics came
along.  There's a Russian doctor who is claiming great success with phage
therapy now that we can apply modern genetic knowledge and biotechnology.

Lowering population pressure would have nothing to do with averting
antibiotic resistance, but I digress.

Indeed, we do need an ecosystem to survive.  But artificial ecosystems, by
which I mean farms and such, do just fine.  They can run the carbon cycles
and the nitrogen cycles just as well as natural ones (better, really, from
our point of view).  Things like the hydrologic cycles and the geologic ones
are done by the weather and plate techtonics.  Most of the real work of the
ecosystems (garbage disposal and cycles for the less common elements) is done
by the germs, and they remain ubiquitous.

Here's another interesting tidbit on the brain size business -

Occaisionally people go in for brain scans and there's nothing there.  This
caused great consternation on the part of the doctors until they realized
that these people do have brains, it's just that they have them in the
brainstem area.  I believe the problem is related to hydoencephelopathy (sp?)
in that excessive fluid pressure pushes the brain into the spinal column
during fetal development.  This condition is called microencephelopathy
(sp?).  It's very rare.

Anyway, although these people have brains, they are much smaller than normal.
 I believe they go down to as small as 10% of normal size.  Strangely, they
don't seem to have many mental functioning problem.  Generally there's no
indication there's anything wrong until they get a CAT scan for a head injury
or something like that and - whoops, nothing up there but water.  They do
have problems with simultaneous attention, and probably other things as well,
but you really wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully.

Anyway, my point is that a lot of human intelligence apparently comes from
language, memes, and participation in culture in general.  It's not just that
we have big brains but that we use them well.

Damien Broderick wrote 6/13/97: <What if human action and discourse track=
 a
kind of Zeitgeist weather cycle, periodic seasons that bias the `spirit o=
f
the
times'?>

Montesquieu entertainingly dwelt on this question at length in "The Spiri=
t
of Laws" (1748), climate and temperament went hand-in-hand.  The analysis=

given by Damien seems to be a refinement of an old idea.  In "The History=

and Geography of Human Genes" by L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi &
Alberto Piazza (1994), pgs. 142-5, the authors find a strong correlation
between human genetic components and absolute temperatures (lending
confirming evidence to Montesquieu's general theory, if not to his specif=
ic
characterizations), and a weaker correlation with humidity.  Only a handf=
ul
of specific genes have strong correlations with climate, a comparatively
slight impact.  The authors are at pains to point out how difficult it is=

to separate out the effects of climate from historical movements and from=

the effects of natural selection.

Damien: <Between the World Wars, Czech semioticians Jan Mukarovsky and
Roman
Jakobson noticed that the arts of distinct eras seem to be governed by
different `dominants'.>

I ran across an interesting exercise in the perennial philosophical
exercise of categorization along this line in a work by Alan Gowans calle=
d
"On Parallels in Universal History Discoverable in Arts & Artifacts"
(1972).  Rather than tracking sunspots or earth wobbles, he tracked the
systematic development of human thought beginning from questions we all
have in common (because we all experience the same objective reality), an=
d
following the logic of the answers as they are tried out in concrete form=
s
of life.  Coincidentally, he also looked to approximately 300 year
increments (not really "cycles" but periods of translating thoughts to
their full consequential forms).

Some interesting things he wrote:  "The ideological presuppositions of an=
y
given era ultimately determine the character of all its arts =AD what kin=
ds
of artifacts it produces, and what forms they take.  Likewise they will
determine any fundamental changes of artistic style or directions of
development =AD both for those arts supporting current ideologies, and th=
ose
opposed....  All arts and artifacts everywhere embody the ideas and
aspirations of human beings at a given moment in time...."

Hmmm...  No mention of sunspots or climatological mood swings here, only
individual human thoughts.

Gowans: "Ideas can only develop in minds already accepting their
presuppositions; and these presuppositions cannot be forced in, nor picke=
d
up by chance observation.  Or more succinctly, to be absorbed and acted
upon, truths must seem self-evident.  The kind of questions that any
civilization asks about itself and the world is determined by the
presuppositions it takes to be self-evident truths....  Underlying mental=

attitudes of civilization in any age are not transmissible in the ordinar=
y
sense.  They are absorbed by rather than taught to its members.  They are=

not arrived at by reasoning processes, but instead provide the foundation=

for whatever reasoning processes a given civilization may employ...."

I think Damien gets at some of this when he writes "the collectivity tend=
s
to lag another decade behind the cultural standard-bearers.  This communa=
l
sluggishness might be dubbed `Zeitgeist inertia'."

Gowans concludes: "So far from arts being determined by means of producti=
on
or being reflections of the spirit of an age, the principle of arts being=

determined by social function makes them chief agents for the ideas which=

determine economic, political, religious, and all other institutions of
society.  Or more simply =AD arts create Zeitgeist, not the other way rou=
nd."

Its true that social functions are formed by many factors, including
climate and geography; but always foremost is the factor of the
individual's relations with groups of outsiders, that is, individuals who=

do not hold the presuppositions taken to be self-evident truths.  Our own=

inventions and the nutcases who wield them are far more of a threat to
human survival than anything Mother Nature is likely to throw our way.  S=

in relation to yourself and yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert
otherwise is to commit a category error in analysis.

Damien: <Two obvious sites to look for the primary script of such a

The first is the generations of history.  Could human chronicles form
chapters of a regular length, so to speak?  The second is the succession =

stages of each individual's life.  Might the life-cycle sequence somehow

history?  Those are quite different questions from the discredited

The generations of history is "The Fourth Turning" sleight-of-hand, utter=

arbitrary unless self-centered.  The succession of stages is just more
quasi-deterministic academic depth pschology (like Gail Sheehy using big
words).  They both are recognized as being another permutation of
historicism, the attempt to sneak determinism back into liberty-loving
Western polities to subvert them, and just as discredited as any other
variety.

Damien: <Clearly, what's needed is a theoretical perspective able to bind=

together the empirical evidence for historical recurrences, and organise
them into a schema of some robustness.>

Clearly, what's needed is some extreme skepticism about so-called
"empirical evidence" for historical recurrences.  Individuals aren't
pistons in an engine, they never recur.  Individuals make history and
individuals never recur, so why should history recur?  History in the
modern sense only arose when the individual was taken to be of supreme
worth, the dignity of man.  This was specific to Greco-Roman culture and
Western Christianity, no other cultures, anywhere or any time, ever
developed this notion.  Attempts to make history into quasi-deterministic=

recurrent cycles are therefore attempts to degrade the worth of the
individual, to strip the dignity from the lone human.  Indeed, it flushes=

the notion of history down the toilet and takes science along with it.

Damien: <We are now living through the exhausted stage of an American
century, and, if no better and more humane means is devised for
adjudicating leadership, the world is probably doomed to a new global war=

in perhaps 2030 (but not until then).>

"Exhausted stage"?  Is this an empirical statement of fact, or might it b=

I've seen more unambiguous horoscopes than this, casting haruspices is
tricky work.  The ol' forecasting rule of thumb is:  "give 'em a date or
give 'em a number but never give 'em both at the same time."

Some general comments:

Isaiah Berlin in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" writing on where these
quasi-deterministic ideas come from: "The relativism which has so deeply
troubled historians, sociologists, anthropologists and philosophers of
history during the last hundred years is, in the main, if not entirely, a=

legacy of the schools of thought which look upon human activity as being
largely caused by occult and inescapable forces of which explicit social
beliefs and theories are rationalizations =AD disguises to be penetrated =
and
exposed.  This is the heritage of Marxism, of depth psychology, of the
sociology of Pareto or Simmel or Mannheim."

Ugh... there it is, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - Marxism,
psychology, sociology and anthropology.  Individuals, beware!

I posted to the E-list about "Individualistic History" back in March '97.=
 =

The occasion was some excellent comments by the Australian historian Keit=
h
Windschuttle, in his essay "The Real Stuff of History" published in "The
New Criterion" March 1997.  Windschuttle correctly pointed out that
anthropology and sociology have long lost their intellectual
respectability.  He also delivered a devastatingly accurate indictment of=

why academia has waged war on the individual.

First, he points out that Ferdinand Braudel (mentioned by Damien) wrote i=
n
"The Identity of France": "Men do not make history, rather it is history
above all that makes men and absolves them of blame."  Therefore, I would=

say that attempts to find deterministic cycles in history, whether it's
caused by our genes or by the climate, are childish efforts to achieve
freedom from the consequences of our actions.

Secondly, he wrote about the reaction of Western academia to the politica=
l
disappointments of 1968:  "[T]his kind of historical determinism became a=

comfort blanket for the academic Left.  There was no longer any need for =
a
radical to be politically active since activism could make no difference =
to
the great determining structures.  All that remained was to study,
theorize, and debate the nature of the structures themselves.  This was a=
n
agenda perfectly suited to the academic world of seminars, conferences,
cafes, and bars, and to the careers, tenure, and promotions that have
focused their minds ever since."

Ouch!  I'm glad I'm not a professor, that barb would've sunk deep.

I was thinking of an upload in the form of an artificial computer simulation.
 That would allow us to be free from physical restraints.  As opposed to
augmenting our interaction with the physical world.

Since many Extropian ideas have yet to come of age, how about we concentate
on the more pratical things - Critical Thinking as a part of basic education,
more freedom for researchers, de-legalisation of drugs (that'll get us a few
letter bombs), funding of AI research and building a global information
network.  Just the fact that we acknowlege there are going to be changes in
the future should put us ahead of the rest!  Any other ideas ?

You appear to be arguing for the so-called "Cartesian Theater", a
notion thoroughly demolished by Dennett in "Consciousness Explained".

Are you familiar with Dennett's arguments on the subject? I'm not sure
I believe *all* of them, but they are very convincing overall, and
backed with lots of empirical evidence.

Just a gentle question, the same one I'd ask myself:

cyclical analysis.  There is no "generation" identifiable anywhere except
in relation to yourself and yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert

Have you actually read the work in question? (_The Fourth Turning_).
If not, how can you be sure you know what their actual thinking is?
Or doesn't that matter--is a kneejerk reaction based on second- or nth-
hand opinion all you're up for?

Methinks I hear a category error in analysis, but not the one you hear...

I have not read Chalmers' book, but I have read several of the papers on
his web site and I've seen discussion on comp.ai.philosophy.

I agree with you that Chalmers' notion that a zombie world is "logically"
possible is questionable.  He eventually rejects the possibility, as you
say.  But he is willing to entertain it as a hypothetical starting point.

The question of whether zombies are logically impossible versus merely
physically impossible is a bit too subtle for my grasp of philosophy.
It seems to me that the kinds of arguments philosophers make are basically
logical and don't really depend on the nature of the physical world.
I suppose they are not logical in the strict sense of axiomatic deduction;
even in the fading qualia example Chalmers admits that it is conceivable
that consciousness would behave in that bizarre and counter-intuitive way,
where people are unable to describe their fading consciousness.

Is it this loophole in his argument that forces him to leave open the
possibility of zombies?  In that case I would say that the problem
is that his argument is not airtight, rather than that it is based on
the nature of the physical world.  The conclusion I draw is that it is
*very likely* that zombies are logically impossible, not that they are
logically possible but physically impossible.

	Amazon.com is having a big sale so now is a good time for me to look for
books.   Specifically, I'm looking for books that would help teach critical
thinking.  Someone suggested economics--->Bayesian statistics--->game
theory.  I have a good background in economics (is Hidden Order any good? 
I've read Hazlit's Economics in One Lesson) but my understanding of
statistics and game theory is shallow at best.  
	Books that would provide a good background in cosmology and relativity are
of interest as well.

Thanks,

If you stimulate a part of my brain I may indeed have a conscious experience  
of some sort, but the only reason I would have for thinking it was anything  
like the experience you're having is that a theory of consciousness that  
somebody thought up tells me it is. Now I'm sure we will have such theories,  
I'm sure we will have lots and lots of them, but the trouble is unlike 
theories of intelligence, consciousness theories are very easy to dream up,  
far, far too easy. These theories have no objective facts they must explain  
so there is no limit to the number of them you can crank out. How could we  
ever know which theory is correct?

Let's say you have a super sophisticated brain analyzing machine. One day  
you feel sad and analyze your brain with the machine. You develop a 
reasonably sounding theory to equate the state of the neurons in your head to 
your subjective experience. How do you test your theory? Well, you try it on 
me. You notice that the state of my neurons is similar (but not identical) to
yours when you felt sad, and from this you use your theory to conclude that I 
am experiencing sadness just like you did. As proof your theory was 
successful you point to the fact that I have tears in my eyes and I made a 
noise with my mouth that sounded like "I feel sad".

In any other area this would be sufficient proof that your theory was correct  
but in this one area, for reasons I don't understand, people demand a level 
of rigor not seen in any other human endeavor, not even pure mathematics. 
A skeptic could correctly point out that the state of my neurons were not
identical to yours only similar, we are after all different people with 
different brains. The differences could be crucial, you really felt sad but 
it's different with me, I get tear production elevated and the nerves in my 
mouth stimulate my tongue to make a noise like " I feel sad" but really  I 
feel nothing. The only way to know for sure what it's like to be me is to 
turn your brain into an identical copy of mine, but then you wouldn't be you 
you'd be me.                                

Actions are not a perfect instrument for studying consciousness but  it will 
just have to do because we will never find anything better.

I agree with you, although I can't prove it with mathematical certainty I  
think the idea of intelligent zombies is crazy and it's entirely reasonable 
to assume that information (memes and genes) is the essence of a person. 
I can  give you 4 reasons to support my view, any one of which I find 
convincing,  the fact that they all point in the same  direction makes the 
case overwhelming, not beyond a shadow of a doubt but certainly beyond a   
reasonable doubt.

1) The Genetic Code, the blueprint for the body, including the brain, is a 
   DIGITAL code, the only difference is that life's digital code uses base 4 
   and most computers use base two. The way ribosome's use this information 
   to assemble the building blocks of life (not atoms but a slightly higher 
   level object, amino acids) is amazingly computer like. 

2) Nobody has ever seen even a hint of fundamental new physics in the matter 
   of the brain, and it uses the same building blocks as non thinking matter. 
   The difference must be at a higher level, how the matter is organized and 
   there science has found vast differences. To organize anything you need to 
   know how to arrange the parts so that you get something that is a 
   functioning whole, and all that takes is information.

3) There is no scientific reason that information processing can't duplicate 
   the behavior of an intelligent person, Turing said that 40 years ago. 
   I will concede he didn't prove that's the way the brain does it, nor did 
   he prove anything about consciousness, but I think it's very probable that 
   information processing , if it's complex enough, generates subjectivity. 

4) I don't see how the essence of a person, consciousness, could be an 
   unobservable characteristic, because if it was we would never have evolved 
   it, thus information processing must be able to duplicate the essence of a 
   person. The  Turing test may not perfect but it's the best way we have to 
   find consciousness  and we are not likely to find a better one. If the 
   Turing test is good for intelligence but not for consciousness that would 
   mean that consciousness is not needed for intelligent behavior, so why did 
   Evolution ever come up with consciousness in the first place?  Evolution 
   is interested in our internal  mental states ONLY if they impact behavior. 
   Even if consciousness arose by pure chance (extremely unlikely to say the 
   least) most would have lost it by now because of genetic drift, like the 
   eyes in fish that have lived in dark caves for millions of years.  
   If Turing is wrong then so is Darwin. 

The only way Turing and Darwin could be wrong is if we posses some inner 
non material quality (and not just information) that can not be duplicated by 
nanotechnology or even detected by the scientific method, in other words if 
we had a soul. If I believed that I would be much more interested in the 
mumbo-jumbo of conventional religion than in science.

I guess this is another one of persistant scientific myths floating
around. Some months ago this condition was discussed on
bionet.neuroscience, the apparent consensus being that there is very
little to the original paper. On similiar vein, anybody knows where the
bike gang alpha with nonconvoluted brain mythoid comes from? Curious.

Apart from the fact that I'd love to see a _natural_ computer simulation: 
please observe that the infrastructure supporting you is still located in
the real, physical world. An efficient spatially distributed system will
still let implementation-layer relativistic constraints shine through
(while reading teledesic http://www.teledesic.com info , I was thrilled

protocol, while LEO gives fibrelike latency).  (<bluesky>Intrinsic

people criticizing uploader wannabes as world-weary aesthete solipsists
bark up an entirely wrong tree, when talking about pulling the plug. If
anything, we are going to shut them down, not vice versa. Unless
transcension is a really real possibility, atoms for circuitry are a
scarce resource. Somebody might come and want both the ground your tread
on, and your body for reaction mass and circuitry. Better be careful.

P.S. It seems the "bulk of terrestrial water being of extraterrestrial

things from Back to the Future * are not quite around the corner. Btw, had
a long walk around Munich today, tried to view large civilization

denizen point of view. Came back home pretty impressed, as things seem to
have started moving visibly, and ours is not a particularly exciting patch
of the world. While not a matter of decades, the Spike imminent appears to
be a very real possibility.

When I say aging is the number one problem what I mean is that of all
the things that might kill me it is the most certain given current
technology and may be the easiest major problem to fix.  It is the one
thing that is not just a gamble but a deadline.  If I get to the point
that I can make a really good argument that aging will be solved before
it gets in my way then I will cease to focus on it.  For a while I
assumed it would be but then I realize that I was just making an
educated guess not a rigorous argument.

Your current emphasis, rephrased as "what do we do about all the unfriendly
natives," is certainly a candidate for my number two long term concern and
understanding said natives is one of the better steps towards a solution.
I have been studying these natives a little bit each day and I do
feel I am starting to understand them better but not enough to make a
major impact.  

If you have a talent in that area I think it's a very good thing to be
doing.  I don't seem to have any particular talent and seem to do best at
whatever I spend the most hours on, so I try to prioritize things (and have
logged an unconscionable number of hours doing so). When I do get a chance
to influence others I'll suggest they avoid bickering and focus on taking 
care of basics and eliminating aging, unless they have a particular talent 
in some other productive area which I would hate to waste.
 
Other candidates for number two are: accidents (not so bad if you are
careful and optimal solutions require social changes and reengineered
bodies), diseases (this one actually gets lots of attention from
science already), personal violence (not to bad if you live in a good 
neighborhood), and environmental and resource issues (which I don't
know a lot about).  There are also lots of things that are not problems
to be solved but rather generally useful tools or opportunities.

Wait a minute.  Michael Butler, are you the fellow who is working on
increasing cryonics memberships?  If so that's great, keep it up.
If you sell people on cryonics (in addition to the fringe benefit of
having them maybe not die) they might actually start thinking about
living a long time and that could get them to start behaving more
reasonably.

What I have in mind is anything that replicates physically (or for that 
matter anything that creates something that creates something).  Organism 
was a poor choose of words on my part.  I was going to say molecule but 
that was to specific to early evolution.  I also considered thing.  
Your term agent is not bad.  

Genes are one of the things that evolve but they are not the only thing.
Bits of DNA both smaller and larger than genes evolve as do other molecules
in the body, most but not all of these molecules are coded for by genes.
I find it easiest to understand the principles with simple molecules.

I'll reiterate.  The number of copies of something in existence can be
reduced to four factors, the number of copies you start with, the amount
of time a given copy endures, the rate at which a copy duplicates itself and
the fidelity of the copying.

It gets slightly more complicated if one allows for mutations and considers
them as partial duplicates.

I don't at all mind personifying genes as long as we keep occasionally
reminding ourselves we are doing so and reconsidering any new results without
personification.  When we say "what genes want" I generally translate that
to what genes tend to do.

Genes can be taken to mean the physical DNA in my body or to mean every 
instance of a given DNA sequence in all the bodies it occupies.  So, some genes
prefer to be in many individuals and some don't.  I suppose when many
people say genes want they are suggesting what the most common genes tend
to do or perhaps suggesting the best survival strategy for a gene.

I think I can safely say that successful genes (the ones that are common or 
endure) use many different strategies and what is most successful varies with
the environment.  Genes and other similar molecules affect their environment
and the environment in turn affects them.  Some genes use strategies that are 
successful only because of the way they interact with more common genes
(fighting to the death over food for example works best when many others use a 
flee strategy) the various genes tend to reach a equilibrium (so many thieves 
per system).

All that being said I would concur that genes are usually better off having
copies in many different and diverse bodies and that most genes prefer to
do so.  However there can be disadvantages to that strategy in some
situations.  This seems to be a very hard lesson for evolution to learn
I suppose because genes have not had long to adapt to human level intelligence.

>Many genes do encourage violent competition and do quite well by it.

Genes want what genes get.  I am suggesting that I think a more cooperative
system is what we are likely to get and therefore what genes have been
working towards (admittedly in a very indirect way).  

In a sense you are more correct.  Genes want many things from 
suicide to ice cream.  Most genes want to replicate (some quick and dirty 
others more cautiously).  Violent and competitive genes are present in 
most organisms and have varying degrees of influence. However I think that 
less violence in the long run is a high probability event and therefore 
the "desire" of the collection of all genes.

Genes don't particularly want there own survival that is just a means to an
end.  To genes (as a group) what is important is that they create one or
more intelligent creatures capable of surviving.  After that they don't care 
what we do.  I am being a bit playful here but if I am going to personify 
genes I may as well make them friendly.  I realize many other scenarios are 
possible but I may as well assume the best.

Here is my reasoning.  Once you have mutating self replicators intelligence
is quite likely. With increases in intelligence the capacity for violence
becomes greater.  The higher the cost of violence the less favorable the
reward ratio for using it.  You tend to end up with something like a nuke
on every block and a strong incentive never to have anyone get really
nasty.  

Then again I have seen a lot of E. coli breed till they all die
off from lack of nutrients.  If enough genes do enough stupid things
everything gets to start over.  Or violence may persist at a moderate
level below some threshold of serious adaptation.  

Its all getting to complex in my head at this point.  I don't think I or
anyone else knows what is going to happen or what genes tend to do in the
long run.  I do think there is a lot more to be learned by looking at the 
question (preferably with math and computers) but not by me today.

>Actually if we get to that point, memes will be running the show and not
>genes.  The genes will just be tools at that point and considering them as
>self-interested agents won't give any useful information.  

Individual genes really don't act as if they have goals (well, really
simple ones maybe but nothing as grand as replication).  Groups of genes
look more goal oriented.  Evolution working on most genes over time seems
to be going somewhere.  If we say genes have goals then one of their goals
was to create memes so I'll hold them responsible.

I think what I am getting at is that some of the earlier post about genes
seemed to frame them as enemies, something to overcome.  Genes are much
nicer to people than the non living universe.  They have made a stunningly
beautiful world for us.  In aggregate they seem to be working towards
creating life that transcends them.  

If a gene does something to my advantage it is just as reasonable to say it 
did it for me as to say it did it for itself.  Selfish genes tend to 
survive more than unselfish genes but if a gene creates a mutant even
more likely to survive than it or other genes, then we would be more
correct to call that gene altruistic than selfish.  So, genes tend to be
selfish but every now and then one comes along that is altruistic
and makes something even better than itself.

I generally avoid personifying genes.  I also frequently find it useful not 
to personify people, or rather to remind myself what is really going on in 
their brain.  Once again what we actually have is a continuum which at some
fuzzy level of directed behavior we call purpose.

Anyway, please don't take me seriously when I personify genes
in significant ways.  Its mostly tongue in cheek.  I suggest anyone
adding to this discussion define what they mean by genes as they use
the various meanings.  There is unfortunately no standard meaning.

I was holding the book in my hands last year in a bookstore.  It was a 
guide to groups and organizations that purported to have the 
Generation X angle, and I saw Extropians listed in the index.  The entry 
read something like "a fringe cult based in Californa".  I'll drop by 
the bookstore sometime this week and see if I can find it again.

Of course; like I said, the fatal genes don't kill these women until after
they've stopped reproducing, and menopause is close enough to the normal
age of death in those societies that it isn't a big problem.

That seems like another circular argument. If the genes weren't reducing
fertility then they'd have a greater chance of success.

Of course it's some kind of compromise between all these factors.

break into alcor, steal Max's head and reanimate him.  This demonstrates
that Max is a normal human being (more or less) and breaks the power of
the priest.  In the ensuing court battles Max retains only a small portoin 
of the religion's holdings.  He does however achieve brief fame as a pop 
icon and retain a small cult following. In a little while Max gets bored 
and decides to leave earth for a large party at a distant location.
(There a happy ending for Max without saddling him with all that easy
money and power).

Not really.  Communication is usually dialogical, as in this list (as in
this reply).  Even novelists and poets who write in their silent rooms and
fling out messages in bottles get responses back, however mediated, and
those responses help shape their further utterance.  The point I was trying
to make is that communication is reciprocal, even when the reciprocity is
masked or suppressed, and this to-and-fro is lost in the standard
Shannon-style models which have an active Sender uttering a statement meant
to be received with maximum fidelity by a passive (if noise-reducing)
Receiver.  Obviously no receiver is truly passive, because meaning is
(re)constructed out of bits and bytes and context - which is why Reilly
says `What the reader does with it is up to the reader, not the writer'.

>Individuals make history and
>individuals never recur, so why should history recur?

My reference to Toynbee's punctuations by war is a hint, surely?  My book
elaborates a model by historian Jim Penman, not mentioned in the essay,
based on a blend of observation of apparent historical chunkings and a
theory of behavioral pre-adaptation to food availability cycles.  (I hold
no special brief for this theory, however.)

Ah, the gratuitous ad hominem surfaces.  I don't much like superpowers, as
it happens, so I'm not chafing.  More to the point, the cited passage is
not me speaking as such but me summarizing the Modelskian theory of long
cycles under discussion.

Yes, Keith read my manuscript and made nice comments about it.  The first
half of the book is precisely about the pathologies of fashionable academic
silliness.  It might be that my own diffidently presented discursive model
is just as silly.  But I don't think it's *obviously* so.

Thanks to Reilly for a detailed and thought-provoking response.  Writers

Seems like I may have punched a button; if so, sorry.

I didn't recall your "lengthy and articulate" response, and I'm not
interested in debating whether it's possible to so buttress a kneejerk
response (by which I mean literally an immediate neurosomatic state path
triggered by an experience)--I see people do it all the time. Terror
management theory suggests it's a large part of humankind's makeup--but
maybe TMT is a crock.

A lot of people criticized _The Bell Curve_ without showing signs of having
even read--or perhaps I mean understood--the chapters' precis. And some did
so lengthily and articulately. Or maybe they read and understood but found
a deeper meaning, like who wrote the works of Shakespeare or something, and
it bothered them so much that it swamped the plain text.

I have no way of knowing if that's what you're doing; that's why I asked.
It seems to me that the matter is subject to debate. Perhaps you disagree.

If you feel like continuing this thread, try these on for size:

(po1) I take it that you'd agree with the proposition that all cycles in
human behavior are mythical; is that right?

(po2) there are no such things as "types" of people (in the "personality
type" sense).

On the way Max is hit by some space debry, he loses all powers of rational
thought and joins a band of New Age Uploaded Luddites who refuse to accept
any technology that wasn't made before the year 2076.  Because of this he is
not subject to the slightly-smaller-than-last-time technology revolution and
is eaten by hungry a pack of hungry AI's.

That's not what I'm saying at all.  Their are many species in which females
remain fertile until they die except when their lives are extended in a
laboratory setting.  Human females in primitive societies regularly live to
the age of menopause which is an event specified by the genes, not a
product of cellular decay.

That's where those other factors come in.  Things like cellular decay and
tissue breakdown might not be programmed into genes.  They could be the
result of the high cost of maintaining an individual.  If it takes more
energy to keep an individual alive than it takes to ensure gene survival
through other methods the individual will be allowed to die.  In the case
of human females it would take more energy than is justified by gene
welfare to keep them fertile.  It takes very little energy to make sure
that she does not give birth when the chances of the child and her
surviving the event are much lower than usual.  Therefore, in the years she
has left before the effects that helped in youth but will hurt in old age
result in death the most useful function she can do from a gene's point of
view is help her genes survive in other relatives through either assisting
in gathering or giving knowledge to the tribe.

Which is why calling the above argument circular is uncalled for.  Genes
cannot be considered one group.  Some genes helped in youth and cause (or
allow to occur) a decline in fertility in old age.  A gene coding for
menopause came along and it was very successful in promoting its survival
in other carriers.  It's just taking advantage of a pre-existing situation.
 The "menopause gene" does not cause the decline in fertility.  It simply
turns the decline towards its best advantage.

Gene and others,

I have reaserched several AI/AL books and cannot find any answers to my
quesitons. In reading the responses over the past several days, there have
been only indirect references to the issues. Has there been any R&D on the
feasibility of an actual DNA-based Neuronetwork through cloning techniques
(e.g. PCR), completely independent of bits/bytes and machines?  If this is
possible, then would we be able to get around the possible "limitations"
and/or of computer simulations?  Any ideas, or is this purely science
fiction?

If you'll notice the periods of conflict you describe, each typically
involves two major conflicts. The first is typically a contest to
determine the "winner" of the previous period of relative peace, or to
put to sleep an outmoded form of governance or competition, while the
second conflict is to determine the area of competition for the next
period, and the manner in which it is conducted.

Likewise, using the 1973-2030 period as the present age of conflict, we
see the first conflict being the determinance of the obsolescence of
totalitarian communism, starting with detente and the final phases of
the arms race in 1973 and culminating in 1990 with the fall of the
Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain (symbolized in the Berlin Wall), being
bankrupted to exhaustion by continuous arms buildups that are never used
to profit in gained imperial resource bases. The second conflict is to
determine what the future face of capitalist markets will be. Will they
be authoritarian nationalist/mercantilist economies, or shall
libertarianism and free markets reign? 
This conflict will most likely be between the US and China as the main
players. The initial front lines in reality will be in the Asian Tiger
economies of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indochina, and the
Phillipines/Indonesia. With the ubiquitousness of the internet,
cyberweapons systems will proliferate, with electronic combat waged
around the planet, with AI's and/or uploaded minds becoming the
equivalent of the atomic bomb that will resolve the conflict. That the
2030 timepoint coincides with our best estimates of acheivment of what
some call the "singularity" indicates that whoever gets there first will
win this conflict.

In *that* sense it has some accuracy. However, that's a stupid definition
for "cult". Cults have all kinds of characteristics that we don't. (And who
is the "we" here? The list? Everyone who calls themselves extropian? ExI?)

Seeing all these messages with "extropian cult" in them bothers me.
Reporters sometimes join the list for a while, and many people look at the
archives, without reading all the posts. Just seeing this titles appear
numerous times could easily add fuel to this false fire for cursory readers.

I'm *not* suggesting that this topic not be discussed. I'm just suggesting
that it be retitled to avoid this effect. The more smoke that is visible,
the more some people may believe there must be a fire.

The fact that you will all ignore my request will prove that this is not a
cult!

Considering what Keith has written about academic quasi-deterministic
formulations of history, I doubt very much that he would agree with your
"diffidently presented discursive model."  However, if you have done a
passable job on the pathologies of academic silliness, I'm sure he would
welcome it.  I fully agree that your model is not *obviously* silly,
otherwise, books in this genre (such as "The Fourth Turning") would not
sell so well to "gullible aging yuppies with the narcissistic urge to rea=
d
about their life, have their palms read and have money to waste."

Much discussion on the E-list over time has centered on rational
decision-making methods, such as game theory, Bayesian theory, risk-rewar=
d
matrices, etc., and why the benighted public makes clueless decisions so
frequently when all these fancy tools are available.  Logical fallacies a=
re
frequently subtle, especially when statistics are involved.  The category=

error in analysis I mentioned is subtle, yet pervasive.  Individuals who
desire to forecast the future, are inherently self-centered, and are quit=
e
often blind to my dictum that when examining human history "no year is to=

be given a privileged position when starting a cyclical analysis."

One of the greatest of academic pathologies is presenting models
"diffidently."  The lack of seriousness among academics and intellectuals=

today is soul-quenching.  Ninnies like the French compost-modernists with=

all their "play" and "games" are sickly, and noodleheads like Richard
Rorty, a self-described "liberal ironist," are delusional.  As Roger
Kimball notes, the problem with liberal ironists (e.g., the diffident
academics), is that "they are ironical about everything except their own
irony, and are serious about tolerating everything except seriousness."

Damien: <Communication is usually dialogical, as in this list (as in
this reply).  Even novelists and poets who write in their silent rooms an=

those responses help shape their further utterance.  The point I was tryi=

The reciprocity, or loop, or feedback, whatever you wish to call it, does=

at all.  It is entirely up to individual readers to accept a writer's
modifications, clarifications, retractions, etc. of previously written
words.  The writer has no part in this.  There is no loop, no continuity,=

no recurrence.  Responses helping to shape further utterances do not in a=
ny
way, modify previous utterances, every utterance is made by a unique
individual at a unique point in time, and hangs there solid and whole
forever.  If it difficult to see this, think of how long dead writers sti=

Think of Nietzsche's idea of "communication" in "Untimely Meditations"
where "one giant calls to another across the desert intervals of time and=

undisturbed by the chattering dwarfs who creep about beneath them, the
exalted spirit-dialogue goes on."

RJ: <Individuals make history and individuals never recur, so why should
history recur?>

Damien: <My reference to Toynbee's punctuations by war is a hint, surely?=
>

This is the reference to Toynbee:  "Arnold Toynbee famously found in this=

unhappy recurrence a key to alternations between war and peace: `the
survivors of a generation that has been of military age during a bout of
war will be shy, for the rest of their lives, of bringing a repetition of=

this tragic experience either upon themselves or their children' (A Study=

of History, Vol. IX)."

First of all, Toynbee's statement is complete balderdash on the face of i=
t,
as Toynbee knew well.  The instances of war-like conditions extending ove=
r
multiple generations within a given society are so numerous, they could
fill volumes by themselves.  I'm sure Toynbee ran across the Spartans, fo=
r
the most famous instance, somewhere in his studies.  The question is, why=

would Toynbee publish what he knew to be a big, fat whopper?  The answer
can be seen by filtering through the following passages from Arthur
Herman's "The Idea of Decline in Western History" (1997):

First, Herman presents some background on the cultural milieu of the
English ruling elite that Toynbee was born into:  "The liberal optimism o=
f
the early Victorians had been evaporating long before Toynbee was born. =

This was due in large part to the degeneration scare, which had cast
serious doubt on the future of civil society in the industrial age.  If t=
he
fear of degeneration had driven English liberalism into retreat, then the=

trauma of World War I completed the rout.  In the minds of interwar Briti=
sh
intellectuals, their nation and the modern West were summed up in the tit=
le
of T.S. Eliot's famous poem:  "The Waste Land."  Some turned to Marxism t=
o
create a new social order; a few others, like the artist Wyndham Lewis an=
d
the novelist D.H. Lawrence, turned to an irrational vitalism bordering on=

fascism.  But Toynbee and many of his generation turned to another
alternative, which flowed out of the New Liberalism of the later Victoria=
ns
and its postliberal assumptions.  Instead of demolishing the West, they
would refurbish it as a community of shared moral values, what the
Enlightenment would have termed 'polite' values.  Tolerance, compassion,
humanitarian concern, and reasonable compromise would define this new
Western civilization; its chief virtues would have a spiritual rather tha=
n
a material basis.  However, this kinder, gentler West would establish in
effect a new universal empire of peace and harmony, with its humane,
civilized values serving as the basis for a world government and unity
among peoples everywhere.  This pacific new vision for the modern West
proved to be immensely influential, and not only in England.  It dominate=
s
the geopolitical outlook of modern liberals to this very day."

This pacifistic utopianism shares the fatal ideological presupposition th=
at
mankind is inherently good.  Fatal because:

Herman: "Renouncing force and violence became a moral imperative for the
heirs of liberal humanism....  From appeasement and the League of Nations=
,
to the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament and the Euromissile protests of
the 1980s, twentieth-century liberalism proved more adept at encouraging
its enemies than at protecting those it claimed to represent."

Now, as to why Toynbee would tell such a whopper:

Herman: "In terms of sheer numbers =AD 702, 410 dead =AD Great Britain su=
ffered
no more in World War I than Italy.  But Britain's casualties were
disproportionately drawn from society's elite:  one third of the Oxford
class of 1913 died in the war, and the death of many promising young
Balliol men cast a pall over the British establishment.  Out of the shock=

and sense of loss would emerge the myth of the 'lost generation,' which
haunted British intellectual culture and policy-making for the next two
decades.  World War I was for Great Britain what Vietnam would be for
America, the breaking of the morale of its political elite.  Among those
broken was Arnold Toynbee.  Yet Toynbee managed to escape the ordeal
unscathed.  Although he initially supported 'the war for civilization,' h=
is
mother's encouragement and the help of influential family friends enabled=

Toynbee to evade service witha trumped up medical deferment.  Guilt over
his compromised position plagued Toynbee for the rest of his life.  Almos=
t
as if in reaction, he became a committed pacifist who detested everything=

smacking of military value, heroism, patriotism, or other 'antiquated'
notions of the prewar Victorian past.  'In 1914,' he wrote long afterward=
s,
'I became convinced that war was neither a respectable institution nor a
venial sin, but was a crime.'  In January 1918 Virginia and Leonard Woolf=

had dinner with Toynbee, and Virginia noted afterwards that he 'knew the
aristocratic heroes who are now all killed and celebrated, and loathed
them.'"

I just love armchair psychology as a spectator sport, especially when it
has the ring of truth about it.

Herman: "Now, after the experience of the Great War, the New Liberal
consensus asserted that the nation-state, too, would have to disappear,
along with its war-making powers.... [B]y shedding absurd claims of
national sovereignty and joining with other nations to promote peace, the=
y
could concentrate on their primary duty:  feeding, clothing, and elevatin=
g
the lives of their own citizens....  Military victory was always for
Toynbee certain proof of moral deficiency:  he suggested that, had Americ=
a
and Israel lost some wars rather than continually winning them, it might
have been better for their souls....  He made himself the new prophet of
the demise of Western civilization in its modern (especially American) mo=
de
and of a new spiritual stirring in the non-Western world that promised a
future of universal peace and social justice.  '...Mankind must become on=
e
family or destroy itself.'  Privately he added, 'One has to admit history=

is against us....  I can't think of a single case of the cooperative meth=

having done the trick.'  But in Toynbee's perspective... being good was
more important than doing good.  It was one's intentions, not the results=

that ultimately counted most.  In a politically unified world, these
various faiths would inevitably merge into an ecumenical religion of love=
,
which would teach compassion and tolerance for diversity =AD the sort of
agenda later adopted by liberal religious groups such as the World Counci=
l
of Churches."

Yuck!  An all-around bad guy.  He told a whopper in Damien's quote becaus=
e
he wanted to discourage war, ultimately through One World Government
dominated by non-Western peaceniks.

Damien: <We are now living through the exhausted stage of an American
century.>

OK, so you didn't bite on either one. I need a Socrates refresher course.
:) I'll just cut to the chase: 

1) your claim that there are no cycles in history is contradicted by the
behavior of traffic on Van Nuys Boulevard just about every weekday.
This does not mean that any particular would-be Toynbee has it any more
right than Jeane(sp?) Dixon.

2) I take it that a serious response was beneath your dignity. Pity. I
consider the question of whether there are "types" of people to be an open
question. SO, one last try at a reasonable approach to a related question:

(po) When is a "profile" a prejudice?

Parental genetic imprinting has been cropping up in recent journals- a
mechanism whereby alleles are slightly different in effect when received
from either M or F parent.  One study found mice get their brains from
their mums and their poisonalities from their dads.

The latest, in this week's Nature, I believe, found that Turner's syndrome
(single X) girls are either empathic sweeties or naughty depending on
whether they got their X from dad or mum.  Counter-intuitively, the
Male-derived X is switched on for the former trait, and kickstarts the
developmental cascade that encourages sociality and Niceness and Sugar &
Spice stuff.   The Female-derived X has the gene turned off (it seems), so
boys are all prone to be horrid self-centred bastards.  

It struck me that the road to utopia is therefore clear - switch on that
gene in boy foetuses.  (I assume it's way too late to do anything once the
developmental path is well-launched.)  It wouldn't turn boys gay, I presume
- or (a different point entirely) into wimps, because women are obviously
capable of protective ferocity, not to mention crabbiness.  But it would do
the world a lot of good if human males were like females in this general
respect.  <pause to allow the alpha males to bellow in rage>  Science
fiction has verged on such a possibility in books such as Stanislaw Lem's
RETURN FROM THE STARS, where men are calmed but not literally emasculated
by `betrization', and in John Brunner's STAND ON ZANZIBAR, where a mutation
makes everyone in a certain tribe more empathic.

A further speculation: every now and then, the salient gene will be tweaked
on by accident or mutation in a male.  What critter emerges?  A (potential)
saint, perhaps?  Jesus and Buddha and St Francis?  Or, after all, Priscilla
Queen of the Zodiac?

Ditto girls with dad's gene tweaked off in error - the rare bad/andro girl?
 Serial killettes?  Mrs Thatcher?  (Prob not the latter; she used her full
complement of sociality skills to other than standard ends, I suspect.)
But it means that the old sf scheme of lesbians making kids sans men by
recombining haploid bits of their ova would lead to a world of women just
as nasty and brutish as the men they replace (but shorter)...

Another diffident, although not ironic, pointer:  Dr Jim Penman's THE
HUNGRY APE, ideas from which I borrowed in THEORY to calibrate my own
heuristic (defined as a stick for poking into dark places) is available on
the Web at

http://www.hungryape.com/content.html

My own weirdness indicators started flashing when I learned, elsewhere,
that Penman is an evangelical Christian who believes that God intervenes on
your behalf if you pray.  On the other hand, he's a self-made millionaire
with a franchise business, so maybe he's right about God's help.  : #  And
on the other other hand, he claims that his historical models are derived
from refutable aggregations of data and theory.

knowledge of the tree is the conscious representation of the tree in

	Yes, He basically argues that: we don't have qualia, "It just
seems that we do".  (Quote from Consciousness explained.)

	But this is absurd if you think about it.  An inacurate
seeming is some conscious knowledge that we have that does not
acurately model what it is suposed to represent.  So he is basically
simply arguing we don't have qualia, we just have qualia that falsely
represents the fact that we have qualia.  An obviously silly statement
that assumes we have qualia to start with.

	We'll we can't know that anyone really went to the moon
either.  Maybe as soon as they left earth orbit they really
disappeared.  Maybe just prerecorded information was being feed to
earth.  Then a copy of them re-appeared upon return with complete
memories of the experience installed even though there is no real
moon.

	But this is what matters.  What matters is people can go to
the moon, do things like ger rocks and resources and everything else
as if it really existed.  Of course, even though it isn't correct, we
must take the simplest theory.

	Just as we don't kneed to know absolutely that there is a moon
out there, when we can do things like merge conscious spaces, eff
feelings, migrate between other upload hosts, and do all this fun
stuff, who cares if there is some more complex theory that explains
reality.  I just want to know the simplest theory that explains
everything and allows me to do all this kind of immortal stuff.  I
don't care if I really didn't go to the moon as long as I will never
be able to tell that I didn't.

> The differences could be crucial, you really felt sad but it's
> different with me,

	While are understanding is so limited we should stick to
simple sensations like the taste of salt.  I don't think I've ever had
precisely the same "sad" feeling.  But eventually there must be an
entire set of physics developed to describe all our spiritual, or
phenomenal sensations down to the most precise possible experiential
detail.  When put together in complex ways these laws will be able to
perfectly predict all our feelings just as simple physical laws
explain other complex physical processes.

> Actions are not a perfect instrument for studying consciousness but
> it will just have to do because we will never find anything better.

	We will be able to do infinitely more than simple actions.  As
I said before, we will be able to eff feelings, we will be able to
experience all the experiences of a sexual experience, not just half,
we will be able to merge minds into a unified spiritual space and so
on.  Effing isn't merely "actions" though it may not be absolute
proof.

> I think the idea of intelligent zombies is crazy


	No!  We have zombies today.  A color sensing computer can tell
us what color something is far better than we can!  But their
representation of color is nothing like the experience of red or any
of the color sensations we use to represent color.

1) The Genetic Code,

	Yes, Any type of physical diversity or distinguishability can
be used to represent abstract information.  But this still does not
tell us precisely the nature of our conscious representations and what
they are fundamentally like.

2) Nobody has ever seen even a hint of fundamental new physics in the matter 
   of the brain,

	That is simply because we filter all information through the
abstracting filter of our senses.  We have never looked for or even
had the tools to look for actual phenomenal qualities.  We know,
abstractly, how an atom interacts with other matter but we have no
idea what it is like to be that atom.

> and all that takes is information.

	But information is nothing unless it is represented by
something physically real.

> 3) There is no scientific reason that information processing can't

	Precisely!  But just because abstract binary representations
can represent color as good as our sensations can doesn't mean they
are the same fundamental representations.  They are not consciously
like each other though they can both simulate or represent each other
in an abstract way.

	A red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.  We
just don't yet have the tools to eff such feelings.

Read Alice Miller's book, "For Your Own Good, the hidden tragedy of
childhood", which states in detail how we are taught pessimism. It also
applies to the topic which may cryonicists bemoan, "why don't more
people sign up?". BTW, I suggest this book to ALL members of this list.

There is one exception which isn't likely in the case of gamma bursters.
If the source object is behind a massive object, ie, at the focus of a
gravitational lens, the image of the object may be much larger than t*c
in the sky. t*c still applies to the original object though.

This presumes that the upload does not have control of its clock rate.
If I as an upload want to do something which involves real time delays,
I can suspend myself until the delay is over, eliminating the subjective
experience of everything "out there" being really really slow.

If I want to use the resources instead of sitting in "wait states" I can
always initiate or fork various versions of myself with can then wait
for thousands of different real time projects. Of course there will be
joins as well as the various tasks are completed.

Thanks for your rant. Not all cryonicists expect nanoresurrection into
fleshly form. I, for one, rather expect to be transformed into an upload
who then would gradually merge into whatever ongoing processes exist at
that time. The only way to presently store the information which
represents myself is via the dewar. When accurate disassembly is
available, I would expect my storage provider to convert my data into a
more reliable and less expensive storage format, especially with BACKUP
COPES!

BTW, would an investor in nanoresurrection be a member of an indrexed
fund??

Are you talking about DNA computing? As far as I know, very little
*practical* work has been done since Adleman's famous use of DNA to
solve a simple instance of the Hamilton-path finding problem (I hope
I'm wrong), but there has been plenty of theoretical work done in the
field which shows that it is euqivalent to Turing-computability. It
might not look like bits/bytes and machines, but it is the same
thing.

DNA computers (or other chemical computers) have the advantage of a
small scale and massive parallelism, but they are somewhat limited by
diffusion speeds, the amount of mass you can handle (combinatorial
explosions happen even here) and similar practical stuff.

This weekend we had a media-planning meeting in Aleph, and we
discussed what image we wanted our association to have. It might be
interesting to hear if Extropy Institute has made any similar work.

To sum up, we decided that the ideal image for Aleph (given our
knowledge of Swedish media, politics and culture) would be to be
known as responsible, serious, forward thinking, international,
tolerant and with a hint of "staying at the cutting edge". We decided
to tone down things like the use of smart drugs, ultra-advanced
technology and grandiose visions of a pothuman future when dealing
with non-transhumanists in order to avoid scaring people away and
causing misunderstandings, and at the same time show that
transhumanism is about living a practical, forward-thinking life.

On Sun, 15 Jun Anders Sandberg responds to my question:

>Am I talking about about DNA computing? ... equivalent to
Turing-computability.  It might not look like bits/bytes and machines, but it
is the same thing....

Anders, Yes, DNA computing sounds correct...  I'm a lay person on this
subject so I don't know what Turing-computability is either...  I will
research the Web page you referred to-- thanks.  What I'm really wondering is
if there is a way for the Extropian user community to upload their ACTUAL
brain DNA to a "DNA computer network" (or Chemical computer), where their
brains would be networked through say actual DNA "axons" as to provide a
"collective brain bank"-- where the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts?

And if so,  would such a system have the same theoretical advantages of
"small scale and massive parallelism" and limitation by "diffusion speeds,
the amount of mass you can handle (combinatorial explosions)", that you spoke
of, or are AI and bit/byte based machines/neuronets a better solution for
bringing into fruition the "Extropian Brain Uploading"  theory, that everyone
has been discussing the past several days?

I am neither sure that you have accurately represented Dennett's

	You should look into the Turing test.  Exactly how do you confirm
your spirtual perception of colour as such and how do you know that a
simulation wouldn't as well?  Do you believe in the ghost in the machine

Only if the cycles are defined with sufficent imprecision.  Here's a
cyclical theory that is suffciently precise to be disproved: the rate of
growth of the French population has oscillated from psotive to negative with
a 47-year period since the twelfth century.  I just made this theory up, and
it's probably false.
But it's hardly vacuous.

Begin analogy:

But geography is continuous, one kilometer after another, no one kilometer
any different than any other kilometer, every kilometer of equal length.  No
kilometer is to be given a privileged position when starting a cyclical
analysis.  There is no "basin/range alternation" identifiable anywhere
except in relation to yourself and yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert
otherwise is to commit a category error in analysis.

End analogy.

A generation is a theoretical concept used by people who try to explain
history.    I don't see why it's a category error to construct such a
concept, and then argue that it provides a correct theory.  What two
categories are you claiming to have been confused in this case?

     "My own weirdness indicators started flashing when I learned,

     God intervenes on your behalf if you pray.  On the other hand, he's a 
     self-made millionaire with a franchise business, so maybe he's right 
     about God's help.  And on the other other hand, he claims that his 
     historical models are derived from refutable aggregations of data and 
     theory."
     
     My response:
     
     Hmmmm.  Might want to look at that.  Perhaps it's appropriate to 
     "believe" in God when the return on investment is viable. <G>
     
     I get occasionally tweaked by the credulity of someone who calls 
     themselves "born again" "evangelical" and particularly 
     "fundamentalist" as an adjective to describe their Christian beliefs.  
     It's probably a trigger effect from being raised in the South around 
     all the B.S.  I finally decided that most of the people espousing 
     eternal life were not people I'd want to spend it with (given the 
     little kid perspective that "heaven" is small enough where you'd often 
     bump into people you didn't care for).
     
     That person who regularly prays, whether to God, the Universe, Mother 
     Earth, Buddha, who/whatever is focusing their intention which is the 
     first step towards bringing something tangible out of the 
     imagination/mind.  Many Christians don't even get this because they 
     are still behaving like programmed peasants of the Middle Ages (your 
     reward is in heaven not here, suffering is good, poverty is noble, 
     etc.)
     
     I recently read on the effect of benevolent/positive thinking/feeling 
     vs. malevolent/negative thinking/feeling on one's genetic structure.  
     Manifesting a loving energy, exercising compassion, discernment, less 
     likely to judge and deride may be a determining factor in activating 
     more of the 64 potential DNA combinations (of which we use about 1/3) 
     in our genetic makeup.  The oscillating effect of higher benevolent 
     energy intersects our DNA more frequently and increasing the 
     likelihood of activating more of the currently inactive amino acid 
     chains.
     
     I'm intrigued.

     "Rick Knight" writes regarding the transition from nomadic herding to 
     farming:
     >  So history (or a cultural trend) should repeat itself?  No thanks. 
     
     Robin then inquired:
     
     What do you mean here?  That you will personally not want to upload,
     or that you will try to prevent this historic event by stopping others
     of us from uploading?
     
     And I clarify:
     
     It was actually a tangent thought off the "uploading" thread.  I'd 
     welcome the ability to upload as I am ongoingly ravenous for 
     information but I didn't quite get the herding/farming analogy.  And 
     I'd never want to prevent others from doing what they want although 
     I'm not crazy about Hale-Bopp style suicide pacts, White Supremacy 
     movements and the like.
     
     The herding/farming transition definitely complicated life but it also 
     ushered in a period of mindless domination and proprietorship that is 
     all but taken for granted today.  It's a trigger issue for me (kind of 
     like abortion: I'm for it rights-wise but not comfortable with it 
     life-wise) since agriculture ultimately enabled the sciences and the 
     arts but at the expense of marching over the backs of the many who 
     were at first slaves, then serfs, now consumers <G>.

Considering that the French are always getting into wars that they lose,
its rather beleivable that there is such an effect of baby booms after
each period of getting the shit kicked out of them, then baby busts

     I reply,
     
     Sorry if I am one of those people.  It does occur for me that amongst 
     the many contributors to this list, there is a preference for those 
     things most proveable, tangible and material rather than anything 
     etherial, supposed, or otherwise imagined.  I think there is validity 
     in both arenas and one should be neither entirely material and 
     pragmatic or lost in the clouds and a naive nudnick for any slick 
     story/meaning of life that comes along.
     
     I certainly don't regard my tactic as arguing by intimidation (since I 
     don't profess to argue and intimidation is a shut down tactic in order 
     to be "right"/win, which in turn, limits information exchange).  
     
     Rudeness is interpretation and for the most part, the wordings of many 
     posts would have to be fairly explicit for me to interpret them as 
     rude since so much meaning is not imparted by this media (no body 
     language, inflection, etc., just words).
     
     So it could be circularly observed that to brand comments (none were 
     referenced so we'll just go with the general tone of the digest) as 
     attempts to intimidate and then further labeling those comments rude 
     is a defense/fear mechanism in and of itself.  Moreover, deciding to 
     be offended may be regarded as a tactic to divert attention away from 
     the informational exchange to devote to oneself and their feelings.  
     
     Rather a lot to extrapolate on such a brief statement but I am somehow 
     strangely compelled.

	I'm not a Dennet expert and Dennett does have lots of good
things to say.  I simply know that this particular argument that he
uses against qualia is silly.  Maybe you could present some of the
other arguments which you were referring to?

I think Dennett's idea is that there is no mental 'substance' from which
qualia could be made, and that our seeming to have them is a *judgement*
we make when probed, not a sort of phenomenal surface or 'thin film'
(made of - as he puts it - mental 'figment') that we could merely report
on like we would report on something physical we saw.

Sounds like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a common symptom of which is
significantly decreased convolution in the brain.  According to my parents
(who live in an area of Alaska where FAS is prevalent in many people),
individuals with FAS can often be distinguished by their behavior.  They
tend to be aggressive and have a hard time conforming to social norms.
Part of this may be a direct result of their significantly hindered ability
to learn.  Although most FAS victims do not have the physical symptoms many
people associate with mental retardation (i.e. Down's Syndrome), most have
unusually low IQs and have an extremely difficult time grasping complex
concepts.  Many never get beyond an elementary school education.

More to the point, belief in historical cycles may derive from
apparent local patterns.  If you keep on fighting wars with Germans 
without one side thoroughly conquering the other, and every two
generations or so, then hey, you've got an important cycle!  Ditto for
the Germans fighting the French.  And the Russians, always being
invaded, always freezing the invaders out eventually.

Ooh, and China, always squabbling with those nomads.  Nomads come, get
repelled or assimilated, and come again later.

But the Roman legions wouldn't have seen any cycles.  They come, they
conquer, they go conquer something else.  Then, much later, they 
collapse.  Britain doesn't have any interesting war cycles I can think
of, and the US has been expanding and is young anyway.

But these cycles aren't mystical.  For some reason the Germans and
French never beat each other thoroughly, so could always face another
around.  Russia's always in the way, but always too hard to subdue.
Whatever China did with the current horse-riders didn't affect the stem
population beyond China's borders, which could always send a new wave.
So you could argue there are erratic cycles there, but you can also
point to the mechanism, and why those mechanisms aren't functional now.

And so with the _Fourth Turning_: you look at the evidence and the
proposed mechanism, or vice versa, decide whether there's enough to
argue about, and if so then argue about it.  Or you don't; my reading
list is well stacked right now.

Umm.  To recap my original point: belief by certain European historians
in cycles may stem from perfectly explicable cyclical elements in local
European history.  Observe local cycle, assume rest of the world behaves
like Europe (or forget there is a world outside of Europe) and
extrapolate that global behavior is cyclical.  Then convince silly
American or Australian historians short on evidence and criticism.

	I am neuroncentic.  But, there must be a bit more to the
neural process than we can now abstractly observe.  When we are

to represent conscious information.  A conscious qualia such as red
can abstractly represent a one or a zero or light of a particular wave
length.  And a pattern of voltages on a bus can abstractly represent
the same thing.  An important thing is that a quale representing

the particular sets of qualia a brain uses to represent information.
Hence, the Turing test will not be a problem once we understand or

information in our consciousness.

Aaah... somebody mentioned the book alt.culture and I remembered

Here's what they have to say at
http://pathfinder.com/altculture/aentries/e/extropians.html
Extropians
[Image:Extropian logo (Extropy Institute)]
California-based nonprofit mini-cult of fewer than 500 members built on
the belief that future technologies will overcome problems that today
seem insoluble. Immortality through technology is a central tenet of
Extropianism: fervent hopes for the future include cryogenics, time
travel, and uploading one's consciousness to a computer. The
organization, whose guiding light is an Englishman called Max More (b.
Max O'Connor), also embraces libertarian thinkers such as Ayn Rand;
ideas like privatizing the air are expounded in the magazine Extropy,
as are neologisms like "de-animation" (death), "disasturbation"
(wishful disaster scenarios), and "smart-faced" (stoned). The
Extropians' slender achievements were hymned in a lengthy 1994 _Wired_
feature.

This is true. In my basic neuroscience course a pathologist gleefully
showed us slides of various malformed brains. You can remain normal
with some rather non-trivial damage, especially if they are in-born. 
One of the more interesting types consisted of cortex embedded inside
the white matter or even turned inside out! During early development,
radial glia cells provide a scaffolding which the neuroblasts climb
to the brain surface, where they form the cortex. The lowest layers
develop first, and higher layers climb past them (another absurd
result of evolution). Under some (rare) circumstances this process
fails, and the cortex is inside out or pieces of it are left inside
the brain. According to the pathologist the victims can be quite
normal (although, as he put it, "few are Einsteins").

There is even a certain "look" to it, with drooping eyelids and a
subtle shift in facial features. Yet another reason to avoid alcohol.

I agree with you. But one has to play on the safe side, especially
when dealing with subjects which have a huge potential for flakiness
(uploading, nanotechnology, transcending the human condition, the
singularity, life extension etc). There is mountains of imagined,
supposed and ethereal stuff out there, but very little practically
useful stuff in the areas this list deals with. So we need to keep an
eye on what can and cannot be done, and avoid being swept away by our
hopes. 

Of course, you are right that many here are a bit sensitive about
certain "spiritual" issues (even my blood pressure rises
involuntarily when I encounter what I perceive as "new age fluff"),
something which suggests the presence of sacred cows (and we all know
what to do with them! :-). Still, I think we all have to learn to
deal with each other and try to make something very practical out of
our grand visions.

"Should" and "is" aren't necessarily what happens in the IPO biz. Brealy
and Myers may be theoretically right in the old corporate finance textbook
(they also say there's no difference, from a financial prospective, between
equity and debt, for instance), but the market doesn't happen in a bluebook
exam.

IPOs, especially larger ones like Iridium's, are usually sold to
institutional investors in order to get the issue out the door quickly.
Unfortunately, these very institutional investors usually don't hang onto
these IPOs for long, preferring instead to "flip" the hot ones into the
market after a few days or even hours, in order to turn a quick profit. So,
typically, the investment bank underprices the IPO to make it "flippable"
as a way to "reward" the institutions for being such good customers,
especially for all the times they've bought into secondary issues of big
boring existing companies, like, say, a bond issue for Kodak or IBM or GE.

Of course, there's also the company management, who is usually more
concerned with getting the stock issued as quickly as possible, and so they
tend to think with their pants than with their heads when it comes to an
offering price. Offering disasters, like the recent Wired magazine
floatation, tend to stick out more in the minds of a company's management
than the 'macroeconomic' effect of the investment bank shortchanging their
existing shareholders on an IPO which will change the shareholder list
drastically anyway.

As a result, I bet that offerings of companies in which the management and
employees of the company are the sole shareholders are more efficiently
priced than a company whose shareholders are venture caps and institutions.
Microsoft would be a good case in point, because all the shareholders were
employees and managers, and the company was completely bootstrapped from
day one. MS only went public because their population of stock option
holders exceeded the regulatory maximum for a privately held corporation.
They had more money than they could spend at the time, and so they probably
wanted the best price possible. OTOH, the investment bank had all those
institutional customers itching to flip whatever MS shares they could get...

:-).

Dear fellow Extropians:

If you think about it a bit more seriously there is a germ of an idea
there. From a more pragmatic perspective it might be more effective to
work from within the structure of an existing major political
organization and modify its direction in order to help advance society
more directly. Logic would indicate that the political organization you
might want to consider changing is that organization which is the least
progressive and least representative of our diverse culture. I think you
can all figure out which party that is. 
What do you all think about that one?

There's nothing wrong with the concept of a generation, since it's been

The listing from alt.culture sounds a longer version of what I 
originally read.  I dropped by Kramerbooks today and described the 
book to the manager.  He thinks that it was _The Gen-X Reader_, but 
they didn't have any copies left.  Can someone check--it would be in 
the lit-crit or media section, I think.

BTW, I wish Will had shared his alt.ending to my little story with 
the list, what little I got sounded great!

The "moon theory" explains lots of things, things, like RADAR reflected off 
its surface, the tides, the chemical analysis of rocks, and photons entering  
our eye. The only thing the "conscious minds other than me" theory explains  
is behavior, if as you say it can't even do that then it's useless and 
logically I'd have to take solipsism very seriously.


        >I don't care if I really didn't go to the moon as long as I will

I agree, and it's why I don't take solipsism very seriously.

If you keep asking a sequence of "why" questions, before very many steps you  
will come to a ontological primitive that no theory can answer, such as, 
"Why is there something rather than nothing?" or "Why does intelligence 
produce  consciousness?". The only answer is that's just the way the Universe 
is.

I said INTELLIGENT zombies. I have to see an intelligent computer, color

True, but it does tell me that the basic architecture of my consciousness was 
grown from a DIGITAL seed, The Genetic Code. My present consciousness was 
also influenced by the experiences I had in my life up to now, and every bit 
of it came to me through my senses and they can be represented digitally also.

I don't quite know what to make of that. Of course, everything we know or 
will ever know about the world ultimately comes from our senses. So what?  

Science can find no difference between one atom and another, a Hydrogen atom 
in my body is identical to one in yours so that can't be what makes my 
consciousness different from yours. True, matter is needed for me to exist,  
but that's not the important part because matter is generic so any matter 
will do, good thing too,  the matter in my body is quite different than it  
was a year ago. The important thing is the way the matter is organized and  
the name for that is information. I am not an object, I am not a noun, I am  
an adjective, I am the way matter reacts when it is organized in certain ways. 
              

        >We have never looked for or even had the tools to look for actual

If we have ever "looked" we must have used senses to do so.
           

        >We know, abstractly, how an atom interacts with other matter         


Yes, I even know how you interact with other matter.            

                           
        >but we have no idea what it is like to be that atom.


True, I'm not an atom, so I can not be something I'm not. I'm  not you so  
I'll never know for sure exactly what it's like to be you, only you know that,  
in fact, I think that's the definition of "you". If I did know what it's  
like to be you then I'd be you.


        >information is nothing unless it is represented by something         
        >physically real.
              

Two erroneous opinions I have plus two other erroneous opinions I have  are 
still equal to 4. Are my erroneous opinions  physically real? 

There is no point dancing around it, what we're talking about is the soul. 
Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the soul  
and still remain within the scientific method.  Consider the similarities:

1) The soul is non material and so is information.  

2) It's difficult to pin down a unique physical position for the soul, and       
   the same is true for information. Exactly where is the location of the       
   information that Caesar was a Roman or that 2 +2 =4 ?  

3) The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness, exactly the       
   same situation is true for information.  

4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.     

There are also important differences between the soul and information:  

1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  

2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is       
   understandable, in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is 
   understandable.

3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that,        
   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.                                                         
                                                         

        >just because abstract binary representations can represent color as         
        >good as our sensations can doesn't mean they are the same         
        >fundamental representations.  


Why not? In Science if two things react in exactly the same way then they're 
the same.
              

        >They are not consciously like each other though they can both         
        >simulate or represent each other in an abstract way.


I strongly disagree. In daily life we use behavior to determine what other 
people are thinking and are likely to do next, it seems to work pretty well.  
What evidence do you have that two entities can behave exactly the same way 
yet have different consciousness?

It seems to me that the mind is what the brain does, if two brains are doing  
the same thing then there is only one mind.
              

      >A red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.   
    

I can't prove it but the evidence is very good that what you say is true.      


           >We just don't yet have the tools to eff such feelings.


But we already have the tool, imperfect though it may be, it's the exact same  
tool that evolution used to make consciousness in the first place, behavior.  
The conclusion is clear, intelligence is impossible without consciousness.

I think religion may have genetic roots.

 Behaving like there is "somebody out there" to watch after you, may
be an instinct among all young animals. Many genetically programmed
emotional expressions - such as crying - are directly based on the
expectation that there is some Benevolent Observer/Caregiver out
there who would notice you and do some "magic" to improve things.

 I do not think this instinct is explicitly directed at parents: in
many cases, young animals may have trouble identifying or locating
their parents; also, help may come from other relatives and tribe
members.  Rather, the instinct may be simple: assume that there is
Some Big Smart Entity out there to do things for you, express your
concerns - and they will be addressed.

  There is such a big evolutionary advantage in having this Reliance
on Big Benevolent Force mechanism that it seems to be the most
important surviving technique for an infant.

  There doesn't seem to be that much utility in eradicating this
instinct after the baby grows up.  Some parts of it, e.g., public
expression of emotions, may be of use later, as the society is
usually somewhat compassionate.  Other expressions - like crying
alone - may be just an exploitation of the old mechanism that
gives a baby some immediate reward (feeling of relief) after
it cries for help.
  The same may be true about dreaming of the a Big Superior Helper.
Pray/cry to it, and you will get some relief. The relief is given
just by the babyish neural circuit, and is temporary, while the
call for help is futile and based on an invalid extension of the
childhood's reliance on superior adults - but so what?   A wrong
belief in the head of an old animal will do little harm to the
evolutionary process.  It may even be helpful - the sickly adult
would occupy itself with crying instead of getting off its butt
and looking for resources, while its offsprings will enjoy the
saved resources, and try to stay closer to those adults who don't
exhibit signs of weakness.

  Maybe, it would also be useful for social development if those
weak in the head would spent their time trying to obtain assistance
from God rather than from other people.  However, by some perversion,
they often use the idea of God to extract support from their neighbors...

I don't think your model needs to assume any real evolutionary
advantage to this behavior/mental model. Animals build simple mental
models of their environment, and it is likely their parents (and
other friendly animals) are included (there is an evolutionary
advantage to have such a model during *childhood*). As the animal
grows up and leaves its parents, the mental model remains and under
some circumstances it becomes actual even if there are no parents
present. It doesn't give a big advantage, or a big disadvantage, so
evolution will not lead to some system making animals forget their
parents explicitly.

Actually, I like Sasha's model, it makes a lot of sense although I
think he is overestimating the evolutionary pressure on having the
"Big Helper".

The Communist Party? 

Seriously though. Looking at the growth of the reform party, it's easy
to see that big things are possible. Even if your leader is insane.
(Well, that would describe the Nazi's too.) Look at the last US
Presidential election. The Libertarian party didnt even finish 4th.
They finished 5th. Ralph Nader and the Green Party finished 4th.
(Albeit many california/Alaska/Hawaii voters voted for him out of
spite in last minute voting because ABC/CBS/NBC/CNN had already
declared clinton the winner.)

What it all proves, however, is that Americans in particular are ready
for multipartisan politics. Winning elections today has nothing to do
with right ideas, vision, drive, determination, sincerity, or
integrity. It is a matter of having a candidate who is Photogenic,
quick witted, and able to 'handle' the press. Because honestly, most
voters base their decision on who to vote for based on what the press
tells them. Bob Dole lost the presidential election not because he
supported tobacco companies, not because he was republican, but
because he was older, not photogenic, cold, and aloof. Clinton, with
all of his whitewater/travel office/paula jones/funding baggage won
handily because he handles the press better.

So as extropians looking at the political arena, we must look at the
best "Intelligent Technology" to win elections. THAT is the prime
directive of a party today. You win elections first, make change
later. We need a slick, savvy, intelligent, photogenic person as a
mouthpiece, and once elected, work change from the shadows. Deceitful?
perhaps. The way things are done already in most other parties?
Definitely.

Take a look at the Libertarians and Howard Stern's Gubernatorial bid
for New York. My personal opinion is that he would have won. (Only in
New York, sheesh) He stated from the beginning that he would take
office, reinstitute the death penalty, and step down. Leaving, of
course, the lieutenant governor, a trusted hand picked libertarian
insider, as Governor. Stern says he dropped out because he didnt want
to disclose his income on the forms. I think he got cold feet because
he thought he would win. (ED Note: I dislike mostly everything about
Howard Stern)

As a 28 year old, I cannot run in the important elections for another
7 years. There is an Ohio Senatorial race in my 35th year, and I will
be running.

Interesting point. It calls to mind what my mother used to tell me as
a child. "Dont do that," she would say, "or you become no better than
them." (Where 'that' was getting in a fight, tattling, etc.)

It also reminds me of Rearden's defense in "Atlas Shrugged." That by
refusing to be part of the system, you refuse to be ruled by it, and
deny its right to control you. A defense which hasnt served American
militia and separatist groups well.

The real point here is that you, as an Extropian, have two choices.
You can be a Hank Rearden, living life your way, but still being
affected by governmental pressures. (Taxes, local ordinances, etc.)
There are things which are difficult to shrug off. (Although, that
does lead us back into the Perpetual Traveler discussion of two weeks
ago.)

Or, you can use the system as a tool. As an American, I dont have alot
of say in my government. All I can do is use the structure as it is.
And if I see the structure of government as a tool to be used for
change, a very extropian view IMO, I will learn to play the game of
politics. I may not always win, but in my book, it beats doing nothing.

The two extropian stances on Politics, as I see it, are Becoming a
Perpetual Traveler and dropping out entirely (and legally), or playing
the political game to it's fullest, using it as one uses a hammer or a
crowbar.

--Chris

P.S.- My recent posts on political issues have a decidedly American
slant because that is all I know. The true GEP (Grand Extropian party)
would be multinational. I realize that politics in, say, Russia are
vastly different than here. But I know that I will be looking for a
political party in 2004 when, finally at age 35, I run for the
Senatorial seat in Ohio. Perhaps I'll be part of the Max More/Robin
Hanson Presidential bandwagon of the Extro Party.

No -- political parties can advocate radical change.

This does not make the idea less silly, though.

The Libertarian Party is silly enough already.

	There are lots of things having phenomenal representations
explains also.  And this, with our current lack of understanding and
lack of ability to objectively manipulate and observe it.  When we can
finally get our intelligence around observing much larger sub sets of
neurons in our brain there will be lots more physical things it will
explain.  When we can predict that YOU will feel what you feel when a
certain set of brain, in a certain state, performs a particular way
and so on it will explain all this also.

	Precisely!  But there is something.  Without something to
represent information there is no information.

> or "Why does intelligence produce consciousness?". The only answer
> is that's just the way the Universe is.

	No, intelligence doesn't really produce consciousness.  Our
brain uses conscious stuff to represent information with.  If such
phenomenal physical stuff or phenomenon didn't exist or wasn't
possible in our universe, our brain might have used something else to
represent the information required to produce intelligence.  I'm sure
some animals and insects aren't conscious like we are.  Nature uses
some qualia for some intelligences and likely different qualia for
different intelligences.  And maybe just abstract representations in
very low, computer like, bug creatures.

> I said INTELLIGENT zombies. I have to see an intelligent computer,
> color sensing or not, when I do I will conclude it's conscious.

	There are machines now that can pass, at least limited,
Turring tests.  Soon they will be completely unlimited and
indistinguishable.  What would you think of these computers when they
try to answer the question: "What is blue like?"  A computer may have
a pre prepaired script of abstract text to answer such a question but
this is completely different to what we do when we try to answer such
questions.  Imagine how you would act if you were trying to convince
someone you used a red and blue qualia to represent 700 and 500 nm
light inversely from me.  You could try it but you might be lying.  A
machine trying to convince you it knew what blue was like would be
absolutely lying.

> My present consciousness was also influenced by the experiences I
> had in my life up to now, and every bit of it came to me through my
> senses and they can be represented digitally also.

	No.  When you see light reflecting off of a red surface, this
information about the wavelength of light is abstractly represented by
firing neurons.  These firing neurons, in turn, produce a red
sensation in your brain.  This red abstractly represents the way
particular wavelengths of light reflect off of the particular surface.
Though the two things are abstractly like each other or model each
other they are fundamentally not like each other at all.  We know that
neural firing is not physically anything like light reflecting off of
a surface.  We simply abstractly know that if we feel a red sensation
then 700 nm light is being reflected.  Knowing this doesn't imply that
the two phenomenon are anything like each other.  The actual nature of
the red quale, or what it is like, did not come to you through your
senses.  Your brain simply used these phenomenal qualities to
represent the abstract information it was getting about the world.

> Science can find no difference between one atom and another,

	Yes, and it is my bet that science will not be able to
distinguish between me experiencing a red quali and you experience a
red quale.  Although you may use one quale to represent 700 nm light
and I may use that particular one to represent 500 nm light.  We may
call these different representations red but they are not subjectively
the same.

> The important thing is the way the matter is organized and the name
> for that is information.

	But there is more than just this!  Though 700 nm light and a
red quale can represent the same information what they are
fundamentally and phenomenally like is also important.  You can tell
the difference between light and firing neurons.

> If we have ever "looked" we must have used senses to do so.

	I know that the sensation I get from looking at a fire red
mustang is very different from what I experience when I try to
remember that red.  With my eyes closed I can't normally experience
this red sensation, unless I am dreaming.  I know the difference
between these two representations and I did not find out this
difference information from my senses.

> If I did know what it's like to be you then I'd be you.

	Some day you will be able to configure a part of your brain to
reproduce the same conscious phenomenon that is going on in my brain
because of our scientific physical understanding of the processes that
we will discover.  You will then know precisely what it is like for me
to experience something.  As I said earlier, you may discover that I
represent salt with an entirely different quale than what you
represent the taste of salt with.

> There is no point dancing around it, what we're talking about is the
> soul.

	Yes.  The soul is particular set of physical stuff that
produces a particular set of conscious phenomenon to represent itself.
The information describing which particular stuff and the organization
of this stuff is us.  But, just as important is the fundamental and
phenomenal natures of this stuff is the answer to the question: what
is this stuff like?  You can abstractly represent a red sensation with
700 nm light but this light tells you nothing about what red is really
like.  You can abstractly represent any part of information about what
this stuff is like with different stuff, but it will be just that:
different fundamental physical stuff or phenomenon.  What is
representing abstract information and what it is like is important also.

> 4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.

	Yes, if you take the proper fundamental physical stuff and
phenomenon and put it in the same operating state, it will eternally
be you or indistinguishable from you.  But, if you use different stuff
to represent or model the same information or process, though it may
abstractly model you, it will be fundamentally different and
distinguishable from you.  The information is important but the nature
of the particular stuff and what it is like is also important for
consciousness.

> 1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  

	I would completely disagree with this.  What is there about
the soul that can't be duplicated given the proper ability to
manipulate physical stuff into the proper operating state?

> 2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable,

	What a depressing thought.  Why would you think this?  I see
no evidence that points to this.  Once we understand and predict the
physics of conscious phenomenon we will fathom it all.  Once we do
this the world will become a very different place in which uploading
and immortality will not be the only differences.

>   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.

	Why would you say this?  If there is anything there of any
importance, that has any influence at all in this universe, both
consciously and physically, and in our lives, we will eventually
completely understand it just like we know and understand traditional
physics.  Why insist something like this so faithlessly and what
evidence is there to support this assertion of eternal ignorance?

> What evidence do you have that two entities can behave exactly the
> same way yet have different consciousness?

	You can put on colored glasses which will invert the qualia
you use to represent particular wavelengths of light.  (Or you might
invert the color wiring between your retina and the primary visual
cortex) What you once called blue might become red and what was once
red might become blue.  You will act the same, but you subjective
experience or the way you represent the visual world will be very
different.  And of course your answer two the question: what is red
and blue like would become inverted.

> I can't prove it but the evidence is very good that what you say is
> true.

	No, you simply haven't yet discovered a way to demonstrate
that a red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.  A big
difference.

> The conclusion is clear, intelligence is impossible without
> consciousness.

	No.  Machines are intelligent.  They know things.  But this
knowledge is only represented abstractly and not with the phenomenal
stuff of consciousness which we use to represent what we know.  The
two are very different and this difference is what is all important
with consciousness.  A machine can represent joy/desire and behave as
if it is experiencing joy/desire, but it can't, YET, really know what
joy/desire is like.

In addition, we are social animals.  Calls for assistance from "gods" or
"spirits" can only be expected to have some effect on other people about
(especially if they believe in the same gods or spirits).

An amusing (and possibly apocryphal) example of this comes from the early
history of the University of Chicago.  The college was having money troubles,
as it often did.  Harper, the president, went to Rockefeller, who had original
ly funded the school, to ask for more money.  Rockefeller, who had already
been through several rounds of this, said that Harper could talk about
anything he liked, as long as he didn't ask for more money.  Harper then just
asked Rockefeller to get down on his knees and help Harper pray for the
salvation of the school.

Harper got his money.

Clearly, it depends on what it is one wants to achieve! Mountains of
imagination, unproved suppositions and dreamy etherial musings may not help
you when the cargo door is stuck, but  - they make for wonderful music, VR
worlds and new recipes for visual confections... even for a better day...

Anders, you are not so disarmingly critical as many of our male list members,
but Anders, you are also an artist, as I am, and the realm of play and
creativity is COMFORTABLE to us...  not so for many of our more critical,
high focus friends...

I understand the concern above.
 For myself ... it leaves me feeling that I am being told I have nothing to
contribute to "extroping"...unless I can "prove" a  value to art and
creativity, in some objective way. Bluntly ignored by many, or subjected to
dogmatic stodginess of our more technical list members- who critically  ( oh
yes, critical thinking is a gift in itself, and I aspire to it) react when
our thoughts turn from technical data and mathmatical theorum to
brainstorming futuristic delights of imagination, artstuff and mind... it
makes me fear for a dreary grey matter world...

I scoff heartily at most so called spiritual people, and find New Age
downright dangerous...because it is one thing to imagine and muse on things
we know aren't real, in hopes of awakening new ideas... and another :
stubbornly pretending the imagined is real...

A fetus with two Y chromosomes and no X's is not viable. The Y
chromosome has only a few genes that are needed to instruct the embryo
(which starts out female) to become male. Only a few master proteins are
encoded on the Y chromosome.

Here are viable (some are more viable than others) combinations:

Because we exist in the universe we will never be able to completely
understand it. However, in theory, using the resources of the universe we
should be able to accelerate ourselves to a point where we can make an
educated guess.  As for the question "Why is there something rather than
nothing?" there isn't, what we percieve as something is nothing.  The
question "Why does intelligence produce consciousness?" the dictionary
defines consciousness as "aware, knowing" - The question answers itself.
 There is always a lot of confusion about what consciousness is, this is
because the word is used to discribe some sort of mythical magical thing,
which can obviously not be explained for the same reason you can't explain
why there are invisible pixies at the bottom of my garden.

We are conscious, we are aware, therefore we react.  You are not in control
of it, the only way you could change what has happened and what is going to
happen (the same thing) is to change the first glimmer of movement in the
universe (obviously impossible because you are the result of that movement).
 Everything ever since is a chain reaction, the only reason you're reading
this is because you have no choice (you made a decision to read - but that
decsion was not your own, it was based on the trillions of things that went
before it).

Information is 'about' physical things.  It must be representing something
physical and it must be represented by something physical.

How are you defining the soul exactly ?  If the soul is like information,
what is the information on ?

An abstraction would only seem the same, on a physical level it would not be
identical and nor would it react the same.  Science would not look at the
software representing your brain on a computer, it would look at the physical
reactions of the computer (at a level deeper than the fact it sounds the
same).

Only if they occupy the exact same space, otherwise they are seperate.  All
of the differences between seperate objects are due to position and movement.

Sorry. Though I'm very libertarian, I think that any product which is
addictive should be able to be regulated in this fashion. Since
addiction can be construed as a form of physiological slavery, the use
of manipulative, subliminal advertising(and don't say there's no such
thing, it all is or it wouldn't exist) to promote the enslavment of
people to a substance, and to the producers of that substance should be
monitored and controlled. People have the right to put whatever they
want in their bodies, in my opinion. They also have the right to be free
of outside influence when making those choices, a part of their basic
9th + 10th amendment privacy rights.

Only if done with a hint of satire can a political party be subversive
(in the sense that the structure being satired loses credibility.)
However, for a political party to actually subvert anything, it probably
can't work within the structure itself. Change from within, according to
the rules, is not subversion. It's just democracy.

In what way would it be a forking attack?

To change reality, first you must acknowledge reality as it is. As Sun

According to the definition of "cult" in one popular internet book I
looked at at the book store today, the primary feature of a cult is an
autocratic leader who claims a special line of communication with God or
some other supernatural deity or force.

I don't see it here. Of course, we could then market ourselves as the
Un-Cult or Anti-Cult. Considering that most ignoramuses see philosophy
(Max's pidgin) as religion for intellectuals or pretentious theology,
perhaps it would behoove us to angle ExI on a more political line in
order to make plain our strictly non-religious focus.

"Besides their role in sex, the sex chromosomes (particularly the X
chromosome) carry other genes whose functions are quite different.  For
example, there are several genes on the X chromosome responsible for
producing the light-sensitive pigments in the cone cells of our retinas, and
another gene for one of the proteins concerned with bloodclotting.  The fact
that these genes are on the X chromosome means that their inheritance is
sex-linked (specially, that males inherit these genes from their mothers,
not their fathers), but they are not functionally concerned with sex or
sexual behavior in any way.  Correspondingly, ther are many genes on the
autosomes that are concerned with sex, but their actions are controlled (via
a long chain of causes and effects ) by TDE."

What does it take to produce productive work towards life extension 
and well being?

A belief that it is possible
A belief that it is a good thing
A belief that you are capable of it
A belief that it is a better thing to do than the alternatives 
(for people with high need for achievement scores)
A decision to do it
Knowledge and skills
Actual possibility and capability

(Skim)
If significant life extension is not possible it may still be 
rewarding, but does not stand out from the many other things 
one might do.  Possibility is a key issue but is best approached 
with an open mind which I think is more likely once the value of 
longevity is established.  Therefore the first question to tackle 
is whether longevity is a good or bad thing.

(Skim)
My own thinking on meta-ethics suggest that values are an evolved 
phenomenon.  They come about as a result of genetic tendencies, 
cultural influences and personal experiences but have no inherent 
validity.  There may be an inevitable direction to which ethics 
are heading but that involves a discussion of fatalism and the 
fate of the universe which I do not think is required at this time.

My point is that I think longevity may be a really good thing and 
will move on to considering whether or not it is indeed good given 
my own values (which you will hopefully find comfortably familiar). 
I will follow that (when I can) by a discussion of common values 
and how to argue to those values (ethics).

(Skim)
I will make the argument to my own values short.  I think its 
really cool.  I like an awful lot of things.  I am having a lot 
of fun in life and there are a ton of things to do.  I think the 
future is going to be pretty bright and look forward to 
participating in it.  I cant see how my survival will doom 
humanity so I dont even need to weight the relative value of 
my survival and theirs.  I could conceivably be wrong and the 
future may be very grim indeed, but I doubt I will be forced 
to stay alive in such a world.

Okay, there is all the justification I need.  My argument hinges 
primarily on the prospect of a worthwhile future and my 
observation that I find life good now.  

Now what I want is a relatively sound set of arguments and 
techniques that convince other people that my longevity is good 
or at least neutral and their longevity is also (thus generating 
customers and co-workers while simultaneously being a very helpful 
fellow).  I also want to see how hard it is  to convince people 
of the value of longevity before moving on to possibility.  

My first quest is to identify peoples values and the relative 
importance of their various values to them.  Values vary by 
culture and from one individual to another but what sort of 
value groups relevant to longevity can I identify?

(Skim)
>From Paul Churchlands  _Engine of Reason, Seat of the Soul_ I 
learned that brains function as neural nets doing vector 
calculations.  From a psychology book (Zimbardo and Gerrig) I 
learned, recalled, or inferred the following, people have states 
or modes,  behavior habitually falls short of expressed morals, 
prior beliefs influence perceptions, thinking is a conditioned 
behavior, optimism is a good habit, situations have a big 
influence on behavior, belief that a therapist can help is a 
prime requisite for good therapy, and many people follow the 
group and/or authority figure.

I think I would be best to return to my study of marketing 
and sales at this point but I would like hear some ideas.  

What are the common values about longevity and how do people 
group based on their thinking about life extension?  

What are the most persuasive ethical arguments that can be 
made in favor of longevity keeping values in mind?  

What sorts of  people would be easiest to convince?  
What sorts of people would be most rewarding to convince?  
What are some signs that a give person is beyond practical 
help for the time being?

Chris Thompson recently wrote that he believes that winning elections by
influencing the media appears to be the sum total of expedient political
experience.

I suspect that -- like most people -- Chris has never been inside a
political clubhouse or participated in a major political party caucus.

The reality of politics substantially transcends the election of
candidates. Organizational mechanics in professional political
organizations such as the Democratic and Republican Partys in the US or
the Labor and Conservative Partys in the UK are quite complex. This goes
far beyond the usual focus on Presidential or PM selection by the media
and the sometimes to easily influenced voter. 
Obviously, the media will continue to be a problem if it fails to
provide substantive enlightenment and diversity of opinion and fact
instead of its usual simplistic focus on the lowest common denominator. 
Realistically, I wish I knew of an easy way to get more people to think,
and think primarily beyond the self. 

If a small group of intellectual activists would climb into the somewhat
soiled seats in the political clubhouses of the US and the UK (among
other democracys) and attempt to restructure their ideological fixations
into a far greater degree of open-mindedness could we better promote
some of the more currently applicable theories of the Extropians?

I think the future AND the present look pretty bright, and I ALSO like a ton
of stuff, I participate in tons *more* of that stuff than most people do, and
I intend to survive longer, prosper and be healthier becuse of it! Some other
folks will see how amazingly resilient and strong this makes me and mimic it,
and perhaps survive as well...

I'd be interested to know which one you think will be on which side? I'm
tempted to forsee the US as the authoritarian/mercantalist and China as
free market libertarian.

Where do you get this?  I admit I'm less sensitive to such things, but I
haven't noticed many denouncings of art and entertainment on the list.
All I remember is Eliezer's obsession with Singularity-creating as the
primary and only goal of his life.  In fact, I thought the cyclical
complaint about the list was that there was too much play and creativity
on it that wasn't backed up by efforts to apply to the real world.  I
certainly haven't noticed an oversupply of technical data or
mathematical theorems on the list.

I have heard suggestions that the proportion of technical types at home
in the liberal arts is probably higher than the proportion of liberal
arts natives at home in technical subjects.  Of course there isn't so
much social approval of a defensive pride in ignorance of the
humanities, the way people can shrug off not having a mathematical or

Insofar as for me "extroping" is not something I worry about applying to
my entire life, you don't have much to contribute.  It's not that I'm
too stodgy to appreciate art; I'm a very big fan of fairy tales and
Celtic music.  Visual tastes aren't so well-developed, but what I've
seen in members' galleries hasn't grabbed me.  Ditto for much of the
poetry.  As I lack the language and concepts to usefully criticize what
I don't like of "transhuman art", and am too subjectivist to place a
high priority on learning how at the moment, exactly what should I do?
When I think of "extroping" (actually I've never used such a word
myself) I think of Della Lu or the High Willow, and those connections
are largely technically defined.

You're free to believe me or not, but I know for a fact that I'm conscious, 
I also know that Evolution produced me, and I know that Evolution is only

intelligence, but there is a mystery here. Why am I conscious?

I still don't understand why you say "conscious like we are" instead of 
"conscious like I am". Anyway, you think insects aren't very conscious, 
I agree because they don't act very intelligent, but if you're correct and  
behavior tells you nothing about consciousness then there is no reason they 
couldn't be conscious, rocks too for that matter, or a cadaver.

No!? What do you mean "No"? The image you're looking at this instant is a

True, and we know that the digital electrical signal produced by  a CCD  
television camera is not physically anything like light reflecting off of a  
surface, and we know that neural firing is not physically anything like the  
quale of seeing a color. In other words, the physical nature of the objects

Of course you used your senses, otherwise you wouldn't know what red "looked" 
like in the first place and so discover that your color memory is faulty.

Then "I" will know precisely  what it is like for part of my brain to be 
configured like part of your brain. "I" would still not know what it's like  
to be you unless the part grew until it included the entire brain, and even  
then "I" wouldn't know because "I" would no longer exist.

At one time programs were run on computers made with vacuum tubes, modern  
machines use different stuff, would the results be fundamentally different

Even if true, which I very much doubt, the nature of the particular stuff can 
be expressed, in fact can only be expressed, as information.

My idea of the soul, information, can certainly be duplicated, I was

Agreed, it's one of the two main reasons religion is so depressing, the other

eternity for the slightest infraction of his many rules.

Because according to the religious even trying to understand the mechanism of  
the soul is blasphemous and the less logical a belief you have faith in is,  
the greater your virtue.

You say right at the beginning that you invert the qualia, if so then of

it is now, and if you suddenly took off my colored glasses I would be 
completely disorientated.

Just out of curiosity, why do you think it's easier to build an intelligent 
machine than a conscious one? Considering Evolution's experience in building  
such things, you could make a much stronger case that a computer might be  
able to feel emotions but it could never be intelligent.

Nature found it much easier to come up with feeling than the ability to  
reason, it's certainly came up with it first. The most ancient part of the  
brain, the spinal cord, the medulla and the pons is similar to the brain of  
a fish or amphibian and first made an appearance on the earth about  400 
million years ago. According to Paul MacLean of the National Institute of
Mental Health it deals in aggressive behavior, territoriality  and social  
hierarchies. 

The Limbic System is about 150 million years old and ours is similar to that  
found in other mammals. Some think the Limbic system is the source of awe and  
exhilaration because it is the active sight of many psychotropic drugs,  
there's little doubt that the amygdala, a part of the Limbic system has much  
to do with fear. After some animals developed a Limbic system they started to  
spend much more time taking care of their young, so it probably has something  
to do with love too. 

It is our grossly enlarged neocortex that makes the human brain so unusual  
and so recent, it only started to get ridiculously large about 3 million  
years ago. It deals in deliberation, spatial perception, speaking, reading,  
writing and mathematics, the one new emotion we got was worry, probably  
because the neocortex is also the place where we plan for the future.     

If nature came up with feeling first and high level intelligence much later,  
I don't see  why the opposite would be true for our computers. It's probably 
a hell of a  lot easier to make something that feels but doesn't think than 
something that thinks but doesn't feel.

By itself a brain can not detect it's position, a brain can't detect anything, 
only the position of the brain's sense organs is important. It's not just 
space, a brain can't detect time either, I could stop your brain for a 
billion years and then restart it and you would never know unless your senses 
told you.

If representing the function of a brain requires simulating every atom
in the brain then there's no point to creating uploads beyond the
virtues of creating backup copies. However, it may well be that the
number of bits required to effectively simulate a neuron is quite small,
say less than 10^6. Making a neuron via biology is then an incredibly
inefficient way to do so, and other approaches could provide many orders
of magnitude improvements in size, speed and energy required. Also, an
upload provides access to many of the abstractions which make computers
so useful. For example, editing. As wetware I have only very, very
limited access to editing myself. Or how about optimization and what-if
scenarios, things done every day with spreadsheets? The list of
possibilities is huge.

What can be done to forever kill off this evil, dangerous, and slanderous
meme that scientific rigor isn't beautiful?  The idea that there is a
conflict between rational thought and creativity is common in our
culture, but anyone who is capable of both knows what hogwash it is.
This idea must be rooted out and exposed before it kills off the
future of rational thought in future generations.

Are the stars less wonderous to me because I understand nuclear fusion?
Is a rose less beautiful because I understand how a high-phosphorous
fertilizer and a good drip system made it that way?  Is a Feynman
lecture any less a great work of art than a Wagner opera?  Who are you
to ridicule the intense beauty I find in an argument as finely crafted
as any Michaelangelo sculpture?

I /am/ an artist, dammit, and not because I have a few silly poems on
my web page, but because I see the beauty in a mathematical proof, the
inspiring integrity of a rigorous philosphical argument, the fine
craftsmanship of a good statistical analysis, the impact of a carefully
tuned paragraph.  I pity those who only see art in trinkets of shape
and color when the true miracles of the human mind are so much more
powerful and further-reaching.

And you can always use both of them. This reminds me of a wild
discussion I had with a friend recently (originally about a friend
whos unemployed). He complained about the system, and argued that
you should have a strong political opinion of the things that are wrong.
I strongly insisted on having no opinion about the system at all. Even
though I was very firm about it, he didn't took my opinion serously :-(

I just looked through Volume 8, Number 3 (the September Issue; I like
accelerated publication). The site is
http://www.iop.org/EJ/3/99/bin/toc/na08003/ (unfortunately only for
paying customers). If you can access it, the mpeg animations from the
first and last article mentioned below are very fun.

Some fun stuff: the NASA article about molecular gears (Molecular
dynamics simulations of carbon nanotube-based gears, by Jie Han, Al
Globus, Richard Jaffe and Glenn Deardorff), which suggests that
nanogears will work up to 600-1000 K and rotation rates less than 100
GHz. Sounds good to me, although the animations looked a bit rubbery. 

"On the importance of quantum mechanics for nanotechnology" by Noid,
Tuzun and Sumpter was a bit more worrying, they claim that classical
molecular dynamical studies of nanosystems may give inaccurate
answers, and that quantum simulations may be needed (they propose
their ICQMC model to deal with this). I'm not sure about how powerful
their critique is, but they seem to suggest that some qualitative
results may not hold due to quantum effects; low frequency modes may
be more troubling than previously thought. 

Finally, "Dynamics of He/C60 flow inside carbon nanotubes" by Tuzun,
Noid, Sumpter and Merkle has some fun simulations of fullerenes
carried through nanotubes using helium. Seems the tubes can work as
pipes too.

        That is very true.  However, I don't think that Nadia was trying to
seperate art from science, but moreover to show that *others* often try to
create such a rift.  Anyone who enjoys something enough to excel in it is
the true artist...the creator.

Right now it looks the reverse. Seeing as how even Clinton is now coming
out against internet censorship, I think that we will be starting to see
more libertarian views entering the US body politic as policy solutions,
though there could just as easily be a coalition of Christian wackos and
feminist PC cops staging a backlash. Hong Kong could wind up being the
bitter pill that China needs to swallow to begin political
liberalization, though this is still highly doubtfull without a good
sized revolution. As eastern europe shows, leaving the tyrants alive to
vote after a peaceful coup is not a good idea.

Exactly!! Yes, absolutely true! THANK YOU for saying so! That false dichotomy
is capable of killing us! And try and stretch around to the other side and
think: What can be done to kill off the dangerous, slanderous meme, that
non-critical thought isn't useful and crucial to the creative process?  That
is brands one forever irrational to use that part of our wetware?

No, but it won't explain the essence of it's pleasure! And those items are

Ahh, I long to understand that art! It is from what I hear a beauty of

trying...
It is one hope of mine that in this lifetime I can grasp that ancient
beauty...

Trinkets! Hey, finally someone sees the POINT! 
This is a touchstone.... a crux... 
You have hit upon the powerfully dangerous and slanderous meme of ART AS
PURELY VISUAL OBJECTS! Thanks Lee, that says it beautifully! Creative
thought, and all the ways to it, *are* art! I am sorry you totally
misunderstood my post about the higher values of "Low- focus", imaginative (
I am not as good at expressing myself as some writer types). I want to stress
that as an Extropian,  I of course value rational thought. It is helpful for
many tasks and Musings..! My point was that both are ultra valuable
especially to creativity of new and unlimited types, 
but thanks for your searing and emotional reply, for it shows me how tender
this area is!
 ....thanks for being so passionate about your art(s)

Touche!

And, I might add, much great art has profound and complex math and science
behind it.  Understanding how a great artist like Beethoven or a greek
sculptor puts his work together simply adds to the awe and pleasure such
things generate.  Creativity and rigor are more than just "not imcompatible",
they are downright complementary.

In recent mailings there has been talk of "changing the system from within"
by an "Extropian Party" or something like that. I can almost guarantee you
that this won't work, because (true) Extropians are such an incredibely
small
minority. In fact if Extropy were some suicidal CULT it would have more
"followers"
than it has now. Our "enemies" are not just the politicians and business
conglomerates and their henchmen who rule the present "system", but also
"the people" themselves. They are the ones who really hold the system up,
and prevent important social/political/ economical/technological change.
The reasons for this are of course a childish fear of "the unknown", an
aversion to personal responsibility, pure laziness, stupidity and related
negative characteristics. Indeed, most people prefer to huddle up
under the ubusive wings of Big Brother, pretending to be safe, rather than
to boldly and independently surge forwards in life, always looking for
improvement. 

Therefore, any attempt to change the system from within is certain to fail,
the
progressive Extropian ideas simply lack a broad popular support.
Consequently, Extropian politicians would be a small minority and thus an
easy target for their less enlightened colleagues. Their progressive
proposals would either be badly
compromized, or be ignored/defeated.

What are the alternatives then; doing nothing?  No, this would definately
be very
un-Extropian. "Dropping out", as has been suggested in earlier postings?
Yes,
only not as some kind of "lone individualist" living in the hills, but
rather as a group
of  ultra-progressive colonists. Whereto? Well, at first an ISLAND STATE
would
be the new Extropian homeland (something like the Libertarian Island, only
preferably on an already existing island that would be bought. This is a
lot easier
and cheaper then the "floating concrete" variant). In this new state (with,
of course,
minimal government according to the enlightened Extropian principles) a
highly
advanced civilization could develop in relative peace and freedom,
combining the best social/technological ideas the world has to offer.
Cryonic suspensions would
for instance be the norm, and would have full financial/legal backing by
society
and state. Other so-called "controversial procedures" like genetic
manipulation,
euthanasia (of course followed by suspension) and abortion could be
performed
in a safe and supporting environment. Due to the unusually high
concentration of
enlightened minds, the new state would soon be a hotbed of new ideas and
technologies, and a mecca for brilliant researchers, artists, engineers,
computer
experts etc. etc. Also, many (legal/economical) advantages of having your
own state would bring unprecedented wealth to it's inhabitants. Money that
could at
least partially be used to accelerate important research (like the
Prometheus Project) and the next important step...the journey to and the
colonization of MARS. 

Real freedom lies in space, and Mars seems like the most rational place to
set
up colonies, before venturing into "the great beyond". If the Extropians
can make
it to one of the planets, they can have their own HOMEWORLD, hopefully the
first
of many. Mars could be relatively easy terraformed by letting big chunks of
ice
crash on the surface -> instant atmosphere (in theory, at least). The
advantages
of an Extropian homeworld are even greater than those of the island state,
mainly
because of the almost absolute freedom from the oppressive, backward
"sheaple" back on earth, and their stifling, antiquated ideas.

Of course the "conquest of Mars (and later space) would have to be done in
phases; first preparing and executing trips to the moon, setting up lunar
factories
to built a large (rotating -> artificial gravity) spaceship, testing
spaceship, flight to
Mars (photon/solid/liquid fuel propulsion, for instance), going in a high
orbit above Mars, sending expeditions to set up colonies, while others
search for ice (frozen H2O) to terraform Mars, terraforming and "adjustment
period", inhabitation.

Any "tough" future colonists (the real Extropians) out there?

The "people" are you and I as well. My point is that, given the best of
information, the "people" will generally choose to better themselves.
The problem then becomes giving the people the best of information.

This is a common view and, in my opinion, untrue. People do not "huddle"
with Big Brother. Indeed, it is Big Brother who "corrals" them into
finite areas bounded by law. People are, in my opinion, by nature
self-aggrandizing animals. Fear may have once been the reason for the
social contract. However the only things "unknown" these days are of
concern to the most expert of scientists. Indeed, it is arrogant to
underestimate the collective intelligence of the human race -- or at the
very least the democratic electorate.  People are smarter together than
by themselves -- once again, if they have the best of information.

Watered-down policy is the essence of Madisonian political architecture.
I would expect nothing less than a half-baked attempt at deregulation of
key industries.

	den Otter <otter@globalxs.nl>, I like your ideas!

	Let's do it!

	Except we've got to focus on this death thing first and THEN
we'll have time to go play in space.

	The results of the research funded by the Extropian
society/state (i.e. such things as eternal life), though made cheaply
available to the supporting members, could be patented and strictly
controlled in the rest of the faithless world that initially refused
to contribute their fair share of supportring research.  Though
they're skeptical now, once demonstrated, they would be willing to pay
anything for it.  Such a supply of capital could be used to help those
that couldn't otherwise afford it and to finance the colonization of
mars and stuff.

Something exists in nothing in order for that nothing to observed as nothing,

wouldn't help us if we did know.  To individuals perception is everything,
that's what we are.  To the universe perception is nothing.

Think about it, logic *is* cause and effect.  There is nothing that exists
that has effect without cause.

True, without something to percieve the universe the universe may aswell not

These are 4 emotions that are attached to something physical.  All these
emotions are physical reactions, to physical things.  They have been evolved
to help you react (although in modern society the triggers for these emotions
have become more complex).

So the essential thing that makes you be you (and me be me) is the position
and velocity of your atoms.  Why should this be information? or is
consciousness the processing of the information, and the soul the infomation
it processes?

By 'an abstraction' I mean a computer simulating of a brain (or functions of
a brain).  If the computer reacts the same as a brain, it is a brain.

True, and two similar brains without senses would act the same.  However,
even if the brain cannot detect it's position, it's position can effect it
(amount of oxygen, radiation, etc.)  But what would the brain care!?

Also:  If we could build conscious software to run on other systems
(conscious or otherwise) could it be that other consciouses exist within
ourselves already.  Or is it a one per system thing (which would rule
uploading everyone to one super-computer out)

Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission
http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/1997/vol1/index.html

Volume 1 - May 1997      Articles and Abstracts

The Six Essentials? Minimal Requirements for the Darwinian
Bootstrapping of Quality by William H. Calvin (40Kb)

Selectionism emphasizes carving patterns, memes remind us of minimal
replicable patterns, but a full-fledged Darwinian process needs six
essential ingredients to keep going, to recursively bootstrap quality
from rude beginnings. While there may be situations ("sparse
Darwinism") in which a reduced number suffice, another five
ingredients, while not essential, greatly enhance the speed and
stability of a Darwinian process. While our best examples are drawn
from species evolution, the immune response, and evolutionary
epistemology, the Darwinian process may well be a major law of the
universe, right up there with chemical bonds as a prime generator of
interesting combinations that discover stratified stabilities. 

Cultural r/k Selection by Agner Fog (56Kb)

A new model of cultural r/k-selection is introduced. This model, which
provides a classification of cultural processes based on the factors
that influence memetic fitness rather than on selection mechanisms,
predicts that cultural evolution will go in different ways depending
on the balance between internal and external conflicts of a society. A
society dominated by external conflicts or war will evolve in a
direction called regal, whereas a society in a peaceful or sparsely
populated area will evolve in the opposite direction, called kalyptic.
The regal or kalyptic characteristics of a society influence the
evolution in many areas of culture, including religion, political
structure, art, music, etc.

The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity by Liane Gabora
(115Kb)

Like the information patterns that evolve through biological
processes, mental representations, or memes, evolve through adaptive
exploration and transformation of an information space through
variation, selection, and transmission. Since unlike genes, memes do
not come packaged with instructions for their replication, our brains
do it for them, strategically, guided by a fitness landscape that
reflects both internal drives and a worldview that is continually
updated through meme assimilation. This paper presents a model for how
an individual becomes a meme-evolving agent via the emergence of an
autocatalytic network of sparse, distributed memories, and discusses
implications for complex, creative thought processes and why they are
unique to humans. Memetics can do more than account for the spread of
catchy tunes; it can pave the way for the kind of overarching
framework for the humanities that the first form of evolution has
provided for the biological sciences.

Macromemetics: Towards a Framework for the Re-unification of
Philosophy by Derek Gatherer (66Kb)

The review of the philosophical and scientific antecedents of memetics
by Elan Moritz [27] is extended to cover 20th century philosophy. It
is proposed that `macromemetics', ie. the study of the evolution of
entire meme pools, is in many respects a similar enterprise to that
attempted by the cultural evolutionist school of anthropology which
flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Memetics may
provide a new, and more rigorously Darwinian, slant to this rather
neglected branch of anthropology. Furthermore, it is proposed that
much of the terminology and conceptual apparatus of memetics may be
reconciled with that used by recent Continental philosophers in their
studies of culture, thus suggesting a possible Darwinian framework for
the re-unification of Western philosophy.

I apologize for my lack of skill at debate, for the reason that the two
points I was trying to make got lost somehow, and I was mistaken as saying
that low focus, noncritical thought is *better* or more *beautiful* than
critical, scientific high focus thought. not what I meant at all..
so here goes again:
1).
I merely seek to point out that *both* have their own role to play in the
creative act, IN FACT, neither one is separate from the other - it is more of
a sliding scale, with logic and critical/rational linear thought on one end,
and dreaming/emotional/imagination based thought on the other...
The mind can exist in both, to one degree or another...and neither one should
be revered as superior, or should end up eliminated.. 
This does NOT mean that I ignore the beneficial evolutionary trend towards
higher focus, logical thought, nor  devalue it's role in the development of
our present technological fortitude.

And it is numb.

Furthermore, IMO, some individuals are more comfortable staying on high
focus, less imaginative thoughts, just as some are only comfortable in low
focus, intuitive and emotional thinking...
IMO, the more advanced we become we will be able to slide up and down the
scale with ease,  imaginative/emotional and critical/logical - depending on
 what is most useful to our task. This does not negate the beauty and grace
of either state.
As I said, the type of thought useful for songwriting, creating worlds and
images may not work in a practical situation... but then the same is true for
the reverse!

I found it interesting that was perceived as insulting to logic! However I am
at fault, for I was not clear. 

2).
I was asserting that on the list, an unintentional denigration of those
traits ( (emotional, intuitive, imaginative, artsy touchy feely thoughts) had
the implication that a person who does enjoy a good MUSE- imaginative,
emotional, visual, poetic, romantic, dreamy... is doing something
nonextropic....

Maybe I am correct, and my musings are not valued.. since I am not a
scientist, only a to science.... but my experience with Extropy is that
regular doses of low focus, belly laughing, fun, music neophyte, pleasure,
laughter, dreams and flights of fancy are imperative to a good full
experience, along with -nanotechnology, cryonics  and the delights of arguing
whether A =A

With Love,
Nadia

I really don't see that.  I simply them both as completely disjoint
capabilities--among hundreds of different things the mind is capable
of, none of which bears any relation to any other, and that are not
on any "scale".  As you say, some people are better at or more
comfortable with certain mental talents, just as some people are
better at specific physical skills.  I think it is good that you
encourage people to develop all of those abilities.   But when you
explicitly compare two of them and place them on a scale, you make
the mistake of implying that they interfere somehow. 

I do not learn to juggle at the expense of learning to shoot a
basketball (though it might appear that way considering my talents
in those areas :).  Each is completely individual, as are the
talents of rational thought and creative imagination.  They have
nothing to do with each other, and discussing them together and
calling them a continuum of sorts just feeds our prejudices that
they are somehow at odds, and that perception can cause genuine
harm by perpetuating stereotypes like "artist" and "nerd" based
on that mistake.

Perhaps I am deficient in non-logical talents; if so, I might learn
from the musings of other creative minds who are not, but I don't
plan on abandoning those rational facilities I do have, and I will
vigorously defend their value.  Sorry if I occasionally catch an
artist in the crossfire.

This is a minor point, but I beg to differ. It's just that I am very 
tired of seeing "Mars" be the first thing that springs to people's
lips when space development is discussed. I've already lived at the
bottom of a large gravity well for a few decades, and I don't think
I'm going to be eager to get into another one as soon as I get out
of this one.

Oh, I haven't really picked one yet. I figure at the beginning minimizing
delta-vee while still getting yourself to a rock with sufficient volatiles
will be the main thing, but later on... well, most of those big rocks out
toward Jupiter have low albedos and spectroscopic signatures indicating
polymerized formaldehyde and other organics, and Drexler hasn't said 
anything to make me think that carbon atoms aren't going to continue to
be in hot demand.   ;)

Something in orbit around Jupiter might be nice too. Nick Szabo made a 
nice argument (involving the extraction of energy from Jupiter's intense,
rotating, magnetic field) that Jupiter may well be the industrial capital
of the solar system for a long time to come. Sure, you can get more
energy by hugging up to Sol, but the inner Solar System lacks volatiles,
which means it lacks carbon, which means you have to import a lot of mass.

(Interested parties are referred to Nick's essay:
	http://www.best.com/~szabo/comet.mining.html )

Thom Quinn listed viable combinations of sex chromosomes:
	XO	XY	XYY	XYYY
	XX	XXY	XXYY
	XXX		XXXYY

Strange that the list includes XXX and XXXYY but not XXXY.

I agree. I stake a claim to Amalthea, I want to build a
tether-generator there (and to find out what that green stuff on the
slopes is). If there is no life on Europa, I suggest that we seed it
(shades of Schismatrix?).

I think both of you are slightly right, slightly wrong (talk about a
definite stand! :-) The creative act needs both dreaming/imagination,
the creation of new and unlikely ideas, and critical analysis to get
rid of those 99% which are pure junk and implement the good ideas; 
this happens to a large extent almost subconsciously and forms an
integral system. Overly critical thinking strangles creativity, and
overly imaginative thinking never gets anywhere. 

Nothing in the mind is disjoint from everything else, our modularity
is not very good; most of our mental abilities overlap in nontrivial
ways. Of course, imagination and analytical thinking are basically
different processes, but they are closely intertwined even if it is
not obvious. 

> I do not learn to juggle at the expense of learning to shoot a

I'm not entirely sure about that. Ok, I doubt you would get any worse
by trainign both, but cross-talk does occur when we learn to do
different things with the same part of the brain. If they are
different enough there is no problem, but similar actions easily get
mixed up with each other. There is also interference from older
memories; for example, I have some trouble with some falling
techniques in ninjutsu because of old motor programs (likely
from my childhood) which kick in when they shouldn't.

That is a good point. Placing things on a line tends to suggest a
dichotomy. It would be better to see it as a complete graph, where
each mental ability forms a vertex...

The influence of your parents during childhood, you are legally stuck
with, though with a good shrink, one can usually minimize the damage
later. You pick your freinds, so its your fault what they do to you. You
vote for your elected representatives, so its your fault what they do to
you.

One could reasonably say, "buy that magazine at your own risk, caveat
emptor", although this is a place where one's right to be informed is
used to do an end run around your privacy. However, I wouldn't want to
have to lock my TIME and NEWSWEEK magazines up in a safe like my guns
and Playboys/Penthouse's just to keep them away from my kids. Nor would
I want my kids or nieces/ nephews to be bombarded with billboards
enticing them to smoke while they are on the bus on their way to school.
I also do not see any commercial free sources of news available.

More and more, people are using mailers which produce this kind of
output.  I see replied-to messages quoted in full almost more often than
not on some mailing lists.  Often the main content of the replied-to
message is itself a set of earlier messages in an exchange.  It is not
unusual to have messages of hundreds of lines with only a few percent
original content.

The large MIME attachments are annoying as well.  I suppose if I had a
MIME compliant reader these would just clutter a directory somewhere.  This
particular one, application/ms-tnef, is one I see a lot.  What is it?
I assume it is added by a Microsoft mail client.  Is it a rich-text
formatted version of the message?

When I say that A causes B, I mean that if I place the events observable from   
my frame of reference in a sequence ordered according to time, and I find  
event A in the sequence, then I will always find event B at some later point  
in the sequence, and that's all I mean. 

Some thing have no cause and so are random. Modern Physics has caused the 
idea of causality to be weakened and that has caused me to write this. If you 
like this post then I gladly accept the credit, but if you hate it, don't

They are caused by physical reactions but as you keep telling me, the  
subjective feeling is not the same as those physical reactions, yet I can  
still use information to count those immaterial things.

Why should data on the position and velocity of an atom be information? 
I must not understand the question.

It's an alternative definition, it's OK but I like mine better because it's 
on a lower level so I don't have to explain words like "Ideas".

If you smother one brain or blow one up with a H Bomb then obviously they 
are no longer the same. My point is that if the information on how  my mind 
operates is put into a computer and then my body is destroyed my 
consciousness does not stop, if two phonographs are synchronized and playing  
the same symphony and you destroy one machine, the music does not stop.

Subject: Income vs. IQ
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

The 13 June 97 Science, p 1651, mentions recent work by Murray on
Income as a function of IQ and age.  Murray looks at 710 pairs of
siblings, now in their 30's who have been tracked since 1979.  Each
pair has one normal IQ person (890-110) and either one dull person
(<90) or one bright person (>110).  Graphing the average income of
these people as a function of time (and hence of subject's age),
Murray finds the income of all three groups stays low and the same for
about five years, then for the next six years the dull group gets a
lower income while the top two groups stay together, and then finally
the bright group splits off, ending with a income almost twice that of
the dull group.

Of course the article was interested in how much IQ variance
contributes to income inequality, but I started thinking about how
this time dependence would extend given longer lifespans.  (Warning: I
never read the Bell Curve.)  

Holding constant the IQ variance but extending lifespan, would income
variance at the end increase?  That is, the longer time you have to
work and invest in learning things, the more benefit you can get out
of your higher IQ?  Or would the same income variance spread out over
a longer time scale?

Varing the IQ variance for a fixed lifespan, is there some maximum IQ
beyond which IQ doesn't help income within the lifespan, so that
longer lifespans are required to take advantage of it?

Or am I tring to read too much into a few noisy data points?

Thanks Lee... again a great post.
This, to me is like saying brain and mind are different. Thoughts, all of
them, are a part of mind. I do not mean to say that they all come from the
same PART of the mind. When you daydream, you are using the same mind that
uses logic, you are merely using it for a different thing. If you have
trained that mind to logic, it will respond better in those areas. 

I was not thinking in terms of inherent  thought "capabilities", because I am
convinced that, unlike our present physical limits,  we have a LOT of control
of our thoughts, and can choose our thoughts. Also that we can train them.
I would choose 'thought skills', and give the owner his/her free will in the
matter.

I think that is a bit different, yet still I prefer skill to talent, which
implies that we were born with it, rather than developed it.  think the
discomfort I used to feel in logical, numb, pure focus thought was due to
lack of using it, not a capability I lacked...
If there is a physiological predisposition toward rational thought, it has
not ever come to my attention. I have heard rumblings that women lack the
logical skills of mathematics, but have not wanted to let that stop me from
trying...


  I think it is good that you

I see, and I will think about that. You have a point. Conversely  I have
become convinced that this perceived "sliding scale" model frees one to more
creative thoughts ( To visualize this: compare it to the slide from the
dreamlike highly illogical state of sleep, into the clear alert morning
thoughts of scheduling, and back to musing, say in a shower, to the creative
"AHAA" state, where a sudden burst of inspiration hits you) you strengthen
those skills... whereas seeing them as different and separate,  keeps one
thinking you are good at ONE and not the other. Where they may just be
different functions of the same thing....

Anyway, if you want to reply, do so off list,  I am going to go away again -
clearly I am better at images and avatars than at words about art or muses~

I'm hoping you mean this sardonically (ho ho ho, very funny), but if not,
I don't think this argument is going to do you much good on a list as

Yes, many people like for the state to make their lives more convenient
by telling other people what to do and what not to do. As long as we
continue to rely on a statist system, I can deal with people who want
the state to make their lives more convenient for them by apprehending
and imprisoning violent and larcenous people, but I don't have much
sympathy for those who call for the state to make their lives more
convenient by forcibly imposing restrictions on what sort of information
people may print and distribute.

Sorry, but in my little world the First Amendment trumps your domestic
convenience. (Begging the pardon of non-Yanks for my self-indulgent
parochialism.)

Announcing the "publication" of the X-33 History Project website.

The X-33 is an experimental, single-stage-to-orbit technology demonstrator,
reusable launch vehicle being designed, constructed, and tested by NASA and
Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works in collaboration through a Cooperative Agreement.

The goal of the program is to yield proven technologies that later can be
used by Lockheed Martin in the construction and operation of a fleet of
commercial single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles to be called
VentureStar.

The X-33 History Project is documenting the development of the X-33 through
a series of efforts, including the collection and organization of relevant
documents and other materials into an archive, the undertaking of a series
of oral history interviews, and the writing of a monograph and a formal
project history for the NASA History Series.  In addition, a number of
historical fact sheets, a chronology of key events, and several popular
media and scholarly articles will result from the X-33 History Project.

Currently, the X-33 History Project maintains a website at the following URL:

Actually at the moment my model has constant creativity, and it is the
criticism which slides freely.  If you call random spew creativity, but
I suspect that is what it must amount to under the hood.  When you're
tired you're not too focused, more ideas get through, you feel more
creative, and some of them might even be good.  When you're sleeping
you're not focused at all and your mind goes on a random walk.  That it
makes as much sense as it seems to do while you're asleep is probably
due to our neural networks desperately trying to find patterns.  If
you're too tightly focused and critical not enough ideas are allowed to
live long enough.

Hallucinogens perhaps actively affect the creation of ideas, vs. simply
tearing down the critical walls; I wouldn't know.  For my purposes a
constant source of idealets with varying intensity and quality of
surrounding filters works as a model, so far.

Smart people have more dumb ideas than dumb people, because dumb people
don't have ideas.  Really smart people, of course, recognize their dumb
ideas before they open their mouth.

That last sentence was not meant as a jibe at anyone specific.

ASTEROID DISCOVERED TO HAVE ORBIT LOCKED TO EARTH'S
This week came the interesting news of a 5 km asteroid whose
orbit is dynamically locked into the orbit of the Earth, making
it, aside from the Moon, Earth's only known natural companion.
An explanation of the quite special orbital geometry is difficult
without diagrams, but one can attempt it. The story is that
more than two hundred years ago, the French mathematician
Lagrange investigated the dynamics of the gravitational three-
body problem, and discovered that if there are two bodies, A and
B, and the mass of B is less than 0.04 the mass of A, then as B
orbits around A, there are two equilibrium points in B's orbit,
one leading B and one trailing B, and that at these equilibrium
points a third smaller body (or bodies) can enter the two-body
system and there can be sustained a dynamic equilibrated
arrangement. Such arrangements have in fact been observed for
asteroids associated with the Jupiter and Mars orbits. This new
asteroid, called asteroid 3753, is associated with Earth's orbit,
but in a quite special way: the orbit of 3753 encompasses both
equilibrium points and is a "horseshoe" orbit, and it is only
because the asteroid's orbit is highly inclined with respect to
the plane of the Earth's orbit that a collision is unlikely. The
analysis and numerical solutions of the relevant dynamical
equations were presented by Paul A. Wiegert et al (York
University, CA; University of Turku, FI). (Nature 12 June)

NEW LASER STUDIES OF ULTRAFAST REACTION DYNAMICS
Most chemical reactions involving two or more reactants occur in
the presence of a solvent, a significant presence, since the
solvent molecules are always interacting with the reactants
themselves in some important manner. To fully understand what
occurs between the main reactants, one must understand the
participation of the solvent in the reaction sequence. The
problem has been that these solvent-reactant events are of
extremely short duration, on the order of femtoseconds
[10exp(-15) sec], and it is only recently, with the availability
of laser pulse techniques, that physical chemists can observe
chemical bonds break and reform in real time. B. Jefferys
Greenblatt et al (University of California Berkeley, US) have now
described the use of such techniques to examine the influence of
a solvent on the photodissociation of a molecular cluster ion
(Iodine-Argon). Apparently, in a single experiment, they have
presented "a comprehensive picture of the recombination,
relaxation, and evaporation processes that follow photodissocia-
tion of a diatomic molecular ion in a cluster." (Science 13 June)

TWENTY-TWO DAY OBSERVATION OF A SINGLE MOLECULE ENERGY SWITCH
Single-molecule optical information storage would make possible
information storage densities enormously greater than any that
can now be achieved. This is one reason why physicists and
physical chemists have recently been much interested in single-
molecule doped systems in which the single molecule is forced to
switch energy states. The problem has been that so far no one has
found a way to produce accurately controlled switching. Now F.
Kulzer et al (University of Munich DE) have reported accurately
controlled switching of energy states of a single molecule of
terrylene resident in a p-terphenyl crystal, and show switching
of "single-molecule absorption lines in a controlled way between
well-defined frequency positions." The experiments involved
flipping the same single molecule switch for 22 days. Single-
molecule optical information storage devices are not yet a
reality, but this is certainly a significant step forward.
(Nature 12 June)

NEW OBSERVATIONS OF CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF ENZYMES
There is a consensus that chemical systems in biological
organisms came into being through evolutionary processes. Some
hold that natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism
involved, while others consider the possibility of additional
mechanisms. In any case, the extant chemical systems evolved, and
the question of how they evolved is important for our
understanding of many vital chemical systems such as the immune
system in humans. Enzymes, for example, are proteins that are
capable of exquisite selectivity and enormous catalytic power,
and we would like to know how any particular set of enzymes in an
organism came to exist. Gary J. Wedemayer et al (University of
California Berkeley US, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
Berkeley US) this week presented the results of x-ray
crystallographic studies of a particular antibody enzyme (Fab
germline fragment, which matures into 48G7), and correlated the
data with the antibody's biophysical, kinetic, and structural
properties. They suggest that a limited number of protein
frameworks, each capable of evolving multiple configurations, is
the origin of the extraordinary diversity present in the
antibody-catalyst domain. They further suggest that their studies
provide important insights into the molecular basis of the immune
response, and may also be of significance for the understanding
of other biochemical systems and functions. (Science 13 June)

EVIDENCE FOR CROSS-KINGDOM TRANSPOSABLE DNA ELEMENTS
A transposon is a limited DNA sequence that under the proper
dynamic conditions can effectively translocate from one DNA
system to another, either in the same cell, or between cells, or
between cells of different organisms of the same or different
species, and remain functional. Until now, transposons were
thought to be loosely limited to same or neighboring species
translocations. But this week Frederico J. Gueiros-Filho and
Steven M. Beverley (Harvard Medical School, Boston US) have
demonstrated that a transposon of what is known as the "mariner"
family can be experimentally translocated cross-kingdom, in this
case from the insect Drosophila mauritiana (a mosquito) to the
protozoan Leishmania major (the pathogen responsible for
malaria). This development has caused excitement among micro-
biologists because it makes possible new genetic techniques
not only in the study of the malaria parasite, but also in
studies of other parasitic pathogens. The authors point out that
the reported mariner translocation involves the crossing of an
evolutionary divide of one billion years. (Science 13 June)

SUGGESTION OF EVOLUTIONARY DUPLICATION OF YEAST GENOME
After a systematic computerized search of a particular entire
yeast genome, Kenneth H. Wolfe and Denis C. Shields (University
of Dublin, IE) report that statistical analysis of duplicate
segments suggests the entire genome underwent duplication
approximately 100 million years ago. Duplication of single genes
is considered a significant source of biological novelty, but
this is the first evidence of the possibility of the duplication
of an entire genome. The authors suggest that duplication to
tetraploidy may have led to the ability of this species, S.
cerevisiae, to anaerobically ferment sugar and produce ethanol.
(Nature 12 June)

NEW DATA SUGGESTS IMPORTANCE OF MUTATION RATE VARIABILITY
There is a growing consensus that at least in bacteria mutation
rates within a species can be highly variable, and that this
variability is itself subjected to Darwinian selection. Two
related reports appeared this week, one involving mathematical
modeling [F. Taddei et al (University of Paris, FR; University of
Sussex, UK], and the other experimental observations of
populations of the bacterium E. coli [P. D. Sniegowski et al
(University of Pennsylvania, US; Michigan State University US)].
Both groups provide support for the idea that high mutation rates
may play an important role in adaptive evolution. In an essay
reviewing this work, E. Richard Moxon (University of Oxford, UK)
and David S. Thaler (Rockefeller University, US) claim a broader
implication, and state, "The generation of variation is itself
under genetic control, allowing a reflectivity -- an informat-
ional feedback -- on the mechanisms by which diversity is
generated in biological evolution." (Nature 12 June)

AN UNUSUAL OUTBREAK OF DEADLY HANTAVIRUS DISEASE
Hantavirus is a serious pulmonary infectious disease with a high
mortality rate (approximately 50%). It is caused by a family of
viruses (Hantavirus or Hantaan virus) named after the Hantaan
River in Korea, where the first strain was discovered in the
1950s. For the past 40 years it has been thought that the virus
spreads only via the inhalation of microscopic bits of contamin-
ated rodent urine or feces. Now after an investigation into a
hantavirus outbreak in Argentina last year, it has been concluded
that the first known instance of person-to-person transmission of
the hantavirus has occurred. The epidemiology of this pathogen
will need to be revised. (New York Times 17 June)

  From one of the religion-and-genetics posts:

  > [...]
  > ...assume that there is Some Big Smart Entity out there...
  > [...]

  I think some of us are a bit too hasty to dismiss the possible
  existence of Some Big Smart Entity. Given reasonable assumptions, the
  present existence of such an Entity is inescapable. If you believe that:

  1) Evolution to unlimited power and intelligence has a nonzero
     probability of occuring, given a reasonably complex universe;
  and

  2) Reasonably complex universes have existed, at least
     occasionally, throughout an infinite past;
     (It seems unlikely that our own Big Bang could have been the
     only one to ever occur.)
  and

  3) Given infinite past time, anything having a nonzero probability
     will have happened;

  it follows logically that

  4) Evolution to unlimited power and knowledge has already happened.
     That is, the "Big Smart Entity", or "God", or whatever you want
     to call Hir, does in fact exist.

  Forget the Ontological, Cosmological, and Teleological Arguments.
  The Evolutionary Argument for the Existence of God rules.

  Now the really interesting question:

  Why, after infinite past time, with Some Big Smart Entity having
  surely evolved by now, do we find ourselves in a universe with more
  than a sextillion stars wastefully dissipating their energy; i.e. a
  universe full of chaos and entropy?


  This is, perhaps, an extrauniversal extension of Fermi's Paradox: a
  typical intergalactic civilization should be able to do a great deal to
  control cosmic entropy, slapping Dyson spheres around all those stars
  to prevent their waste of energy and whatnot. So why do we live in such
  a wasteful galaxy, among so many other wasteful galaxies? As Fermi
  asked, "Where are they?" And why aren't they cleaning things up?

  Going on to consider the likelihood that Big Smart Entities of
  unlimited power and intelligence exist, somewhere, having had infinite
  past time in which to develop, why haven't they organized all of
  Reality by now?

  Possible types of explanations: they can't organize all of Reality;
  they don't care to organize all of Reality; or they in fact don't
  exist.

  1) Big Smart Entities (BSEs) are incapable of influencing this
  universe. This would imply that

    1a) There has been as yet no evolution to unlimited power and
    intelligence in this particular universe.
  and
    1b) BSEs that evolve in other spacetime bubbles are forever
    confined to those bubbles, no matter how far they advance in
    power and intelligence, so that they are incapable of influencing
    All of Reality in general, and our universe in particular.
    That is, there are in fact some ultimate limits to the
    implementation of power and intelligence.

  In addition to being a bit depressing, I find (1b) implausible.
  Even our lowly pre-interstellar race is beginning to conceive of
  theoretical possibilities for wormholing out of this spacetime bubble.

  2) BSEs are able but not willing to impose order on our universe.

  Perhaps they find universes full of entropy interesting to watch
  from time to time. Perhaps they are completely involved in virtual
  realities, completely unconcerned with our universe.

  I have trouble with this explanation as well. Given infinite past
  time and infinitely many universes, BSEs will have evolved not once,
  but (if allowed by previous BSEs) infinitely many times. If only *one*
  of them wants to impose order on our messy spacetime bubble, it will
  have been done.

  3) Perhaps Reality is not infinite after all, and no BSE has yet
  evolved - i.e., perhaps there was an Ultimate First Event a finite
  number of events ago, with not enough time yet for a BSE to evolve.

  Again, I have a hard time with this possibility. An Ultimate Limit
  on past events just seems counterintuitive to me.

  But this seems to exhaust the possible types of explanation.

  So, in sympathy with Fermi, I'm wondering not only "Why are there no
  signs of extraterrestrial extropic activity?" but, even more,
  "Where are the infinitely advanced extrauniversal intelligences?"
  Why, after infinite time for power/intelligence to evolve, does a big
  chunk of Reality remain out of control?

I addition to the variables of tired/not and smart/dumb, my model
includes how much one cares about being accepted.  Most smart people
are ambitious, and won't generate or express ideas that would get them
in trouble in the circles they care about.  Some people don't care as
much about this, and so are willing to express wilder ideas.

In areas where ideas are likely to be accepted, I tend to look to
established authorities for the best ideas.  But in areas where
creative ideas are likely to get people into trouble, I look more
toward the fringe, where the smart outcasts are mixed in with the
clueless.

I'm not trying to shirk responsibility here; if I don't take charge

As far as this mailing list goes we're just a common interests group, no
different from a mailing list on cars, for instance.  We don't have a leader,
we don't have a god, we don't all hang out in some weird church (and if we

Having said that, the ExI logo and the extropy.org website do look a bit

Incredible.  NASA has attatched a full-time historian to this project, which
is perhaps 1% of its total funding.  I can only conclude that NASA has a
full-time historical staff, containing roughly a hundred employees, whose
purpose is to fatten themselves on taxpayer dollars, while bombarding the
people who do the actual work with memos requesting information and urging
proper techniques for archiving documents.  My government is crazy.

You vote only for a platform and a person. Once elected, that person is
free to implement their platform any way they like. Indeed, they can do
the opposite of what they say they would. You have little power over who
gets elected. You have no power over how they actually govern. To say
your vote counts would be a gross overstatement.

The most meaningful thing you can do with your vote is not to use it.
You are making a statement, "I refuse to even consider the options you
have given me. They are all equally worthless."



Never vote, it only encourages them.

This is precisely a point which Abraham Maslow refers to in _Toward A
Psychology Of Being_.  He states, and I'll paraphrase here, that if we
squelch our ideas for fear of seeming foolish or dumb, we could be
inhibiting a very important ingredient of our thinking process.  This
ingredient I'll refer to as "raw creativity."  It stems from the unconscious
mind and can be pretty creepy.  It can be alarming, it can be scary.  Yet,
if we inhibit ourselves, we just might be inhibiting an idea, once
developed, could help us in the future obtain far-reached inventions.

And, this is where wisdom of experience comes in. Smart people do say what's
on their mind because the developed sense of self-trust that the thinking
processes has become finely tuned.  And, even if a slur of speech is
extracted that raises an eye-brow or two, so what!  Many geniuses have
laughed at themselves for a foolish though.  And, in doing so have gained
the respect from their associates.

You are correct in accessing that people who don't care what others think
are less troubled by reverberations. Yet, I tend to think that individuals
who don't care what other people think are defensive, and have a lot of
maturing to do.

I look for established voices also.  I also look for less known voices that
have wisdom. The "fringe" is not really a fringe by the people who are
sitting on the edge of the cliff.  It's quite cosy there and plenty of room
to mingle about.  It looks like the fringe 'cause it might be unfamiliar,
but its really quite ordinary.

Yes, exactly.  MS Exchange for Win95 puts those in, but the software
allows that feature to be turned off, as it should be.  Netscape mail
is another MIME-clutter offender and sends 8-bit mail as well, which
can confuse some readers.

MIME in general is a good thing, but few mailers do it well; most
use it to obscure more than to clarify.

ASCII is one of the few standards in this industry that people
generally took seriously and that has been stable for along time.
One should generally stick with it unless you really /need/ the
extra capabilities of mime (say for sending pictures).

For some groups there is a correlation between income and IQ over a
number of decades.  If we postulate that there is some factor that
causes both higher IQ and higher income it seems likely that the
income results will compound over time.

I don't think IQ differences above a certain level are meaningful but
let's assume they are or deal with IQ's below that level.  Given a
large number of income generating puzzles some percentage of them
will benefit from a higher IQ, the more difficult one's coming up
less frequently.  Again I think the compound interest analogy is good
with very high IQs adding small percentages which take a long time to
become significant.

>Or am I tring to read too much into a few noisy data points? 

There is a lot of IQ and income data out there so I suspect you could
develop a number of testable hypotheses.  It is interesting but
I can't think how the results would be useful.  In any case I doubt
you will get a chance to reap the full benefits of your own prodigious
IQ before intelligence increasing technology becomes widely available.

Over all I find it hard to imagine a futere where income inqualities
are not much greater than they are now.

If this is true it has great implications for AI and for human
enhancement.

This also sounds like a declining marginal value of intelligence.

I think creativity is linked to the emotions, and higher levels of critical
thought/logic are unemotional, numb, and dry. New ideas, original ideas, are
not deductive, but result from a blending of many things... almost accidental
pairings of unrrelated thoughts... like the guy who accidentally dipped his
chocolate in peanut butter..What happens is that the creative moments are
often unfocused, daydreamy moments...resulting in flashes of "AHA!" which may
be very unclear and even unuseful,  but THEN the critical parts can go in and
hone and perfect...

random spew is fine, it is EXPRESSIVE,  and can result in great Music, but it

Exactly - you are allowing your brain to flow to areas less ruled by logic
and more by emotion: hence the new and odd combinations of peanut and
chocolate slip through

Dear fellow Extropians, 
It must first be understood that politics is the art of the possible.

Is it possible for any individual or small group to influence a large
political organization for the purpose of bringing about change?

The answer is yes. You cannot expect change to occur overnight in most
instances, however. The object in a political organization is to
influence prevailing opinion by presenting logical, viable alternatives
to existing policy and ideology.
Frequently, this is an evolutionary activity. 
It's not that easy to change the minds of the people whose primary
activity is political involvement as an outlet of their daily
frustrations. 
We are not dealing with great intellectuals or academiticians, but
rather with people who are simply trying to survive in a world they did
not make. 
Most people are willing to accept change if they understand how it will
benefit them. 
If all of society re enlightened through continuous education and
knowledge accumulates, change occurs that much faster. 
Maybe we can consider the move to Mars next year.

Scientists at North Carolina University have announced that they are 
very near to perfecting a male birth control pill.  

<pause while kathryn dances a little jig>

The pill is projected to be cheap to produce, with no side effects 
and 98% effectiveness.  It works by effectively 'blinding' the sperm 
(not killing them).  Also, one week after ceasing the pill, a man 
would return to full fertility.  That's a much better deal than the 
female pill, which is implicated in many immunological disorders and 
takes several months to reverse.  

We shall have to wait five years for this pill to get to the market, 
but maybe people could get it by volunteering for testing programs.

Sin,

I think logic is very importanat in "retracing one's steps" after having
made a huge leap of lateral thinking. Lateral thinking can take you to
unknown territoriy - places that logic alone cannot take you. But like a
trail of grains of rice or candies, logic can help you find your way home
from a magical mystery tour of the mind - and actually prove that
there *is* a *logical*, but very cryptic, path to your lateral, creative
thought!

I suppose I wasn't specific enough.  IQ is thing measured by IQ tests.  
It has a correlation to some forms of intelligence in some groups but is 
not the same thing as intelligence.  When I say I don't think IQ above 
a certain level is meaningful I mean that I do not think the tests are 
very reliably correlated to intelligence above certain scores.  I don't
think we are approaching some upper limit on intelligence or the parts
of intelligence most useful for making money.

IQ tests measure factors other that those used for generating income.
As a wild guess I would say there is a set of normal curves that make
up IQ and it is progressively unlikely for a person to be at the upper 
end of larger numbers of them (though you may be able to use some forms
of intelligence to develop others).  Some of these curves are related to 
income but once a person reaches a high number in several of those it 
is more likely that additional IQ increases are in other areas.  These 
are genetic and cultural curves that can be changed by genetic 
engineering, smart drugs, and better training methods and don't apply 
to AIs.

Certainly there are things other than intelligence that affect income.
I would guess there are factors that serve as limits, thresholds, 
multipliers, and inverted Us.  There is also the match of individual 
traits and skills to environments.  Over time there is more of a chance 
that a rarely used talent will be of value.  Also there are many rewards 
to a person not normally classed as income.  It could be that higher 
IQs encourage the seeking of more diverse forms of reward but that over 
time it becomes more likely that someone with a high IQ will eventually 
become interested in income and focus on it.

This is one of those areas that seems like it would be a lot more
informative with some data and a spreadsheet or some simulations,
but I can't think of anything I would do with the answers if I had
them.  There is a lot of demand for intelligence testing and predicting
success at various things though.

If we took a thousand Marilyn vos Savants and a thousand Bill Gateses
and left them alone for a thousand years who would end up with the
higher IQ, who would end up with the most money and who would have
the most fun?  From my rough perspective of history the people with the
highest IQs have not been the richest but they have done well.  The
people with the most money have not been the brightest but they were
not dummies.  I am not sure who has had more fun or if it is not some
third group.  I think given enough time the brightest ones would end
up being the richest ones.

>Over all I find it hard to imagine a futere where income inqualities
>are not much greater than they are now.  

My guess would be that most people will get richer but the rich and
the smart will get richer faster.  Many people are however more
concerned with relative wealth than absolute wealth.  It makes a lot
of sense if you are competing for mates or survival but is less
important if you just want to have fun in a relatively peaceful
environment.

What is the extropian stance on capital punishment? Personally, I am
against the death penalty because I don't believe that two wrongs make a
right. However, the issue takes on an added dimension when, in our
envisioned immortalist future, murder is equivalent to denying someone
eternity. What should be the punishment then?

That's useful feedback, thanks. Do other folks agree? The spiral logo is a
neat way of saying "here is extropian stuff" but if it really does give the
wrong impression we might need to scale back on its use. Is it just the
spiral logo, or do other aspects of the site give a misleading impression.

An entrenched incumbent is buttressed by thousands of dollars of donated
money, money that has his next four (or six) years locked up. This means
that *ANY* ideology represented in government by the tyranny of a
majority (democratic or, at the very worst, despotic) will be conserved
(i.e., will "die hard"). I mean to say that given a system of patronage
and privilege (the control of monetary resources), the pace of change
will be too slow to even call it "change." Whether logical or viable,
new ideas (especially those that are, dare I say, "revolutionary") are
the bane of those people in power. The only way to effect meaningful
change in an established hierarchical system is to usurp the chain of
command, and grab the reins yourself. 

EXTROPIANS OF THE WORLD UNITE!

The brilliance of these people lies not in their product (what
product?), but in their initial choice to "be in control." Power is the
ultimate end of all human societal interaction. I see us here every day
debating how mankind may finally have power over his fate. The notion of
extropy is a power-hungry invention. Dammit, we *CAN* be what we want to
be! This is arrogance, this is claiming power, and this I love.

> Most people are willing to accept change if they understand how it will
> benefit them.

Absolutely and entirely, 110% correct! Information has always been the
key to human societal evolution. But, unfortunately, the more
information one has, the more work one must do to sift out the crap.
(Just do a search with the keyword "government" someday.) I think that
paranoia is a more likely outcome than paradise.

> If all of society re enlightened through continuous education and

Education by whose standards and into what ideology? What kind of
knowledge will eventually accumulate? And will it all be crap? IMO, fast
change is revolution. And in the end, there's always someone who winds
up holding the reins. I hope it's you.

> Maybe we can consider the move to Mars next year.

We will consider it. Whether it happens, depends on where the money
goes.

Two wrongs are only wrongs by a particular definition. I personally
believe that those who cannot give life should not be so quick to hand
out death.

When we can decide to give life, we can then decide to take it away.

That's one of the few issues upon which libertarians, and even
Objectivists, have no specific stance.  I've seen Friedman make
economic arguments against it, but I think in general libertarians
are split just as the public is.

I personally don't think the US Government, or any government on
Earth I've seen, has anywhere near sufficient moral integrity to
issue such a judgment, so I oppose it.  Any government who would
knowingly execute an innocent man after using him to testify
against the real killer has no business being given that power.
(Jesse Dewayne Jacobs, by Texas in 1995.  Governor George Bush Jr.
signed the death warrant.)

As far as punishing immortals, there's still isolation.  Removing
one from public interaction and communication should be hardship
at any level of technology.

Tipler uses an argument similar to this combined with the Fermi
paradox *against* the extended steady state cosmology in _The
Anthropic Cosmological Principle_. If we accept 1,2,3 and 4, then it
would follow that any such BSE would have developed, including one
which will now manifest in my room wearing a kilt. [Checking] No, it
has not occured :-) 

The problem is that you assume 2 to imply that BSEs appear in our
universe; it might be physically impossible to move between universes
even for BSEs.

Is it really chaotic and entropic? The "Harvester hypothesis" of me
and Jerg Rhiemeier says that stars are really quite efficient
artefacts inhabited by nuclear life, from that perspective the
universe is quite well ordered.

And as Stapledon suggests in _Star Maker_, BSEs doesn't have to be
nice or interested in efficiency: they might be interested in drama.

I agree that many people are often risk-averse. However this is still a
function of imperfect information. Why does one choose not to invest in
a new software firm? Because he doesn't know that the firm will
eventually be Microsoft. In the same way, a person who decides not to
risk a drive to the beach because it may rain, only wishes he knew more
about weather systems when it turns out to be a beautiful day. IMO,
people are inherently self-aggrandizing (as I have offered before on
this list), and if they *KNOW* they will be increased by a certain
change in situation, skill, or whatever, they *WILL* accept the change,
and quite often, pursue it for themselves.

I don't know if this is true, but if it is, that means that the people
on this list probably have, or firmly believe they have, more
information than the rest of humanity.

     How interesting to see a seemingly harmless comment of mine mushroom 
     into a debate about who is and isn't artistically inclined, the 
     measure of contributions from the liberal arts as opposed to the 
     sciences.  Calm yourselves.  Turn down the ego potentiometers and 
     understand, without a need to defend, that your contributions are 
     viable, artistic, scientific, mathematic, literary ad infitum.  
     
     One of the most intriguing visions I ever had was a very, very 
     intricate line drawing, the likes of which would've confounded even 
     M.C. Escher I think (I was tripping...).  My mind, full of wonder, at 
     this very beautiful and extraordinarily intricate image wondered how 
     it could've been made.  I immediately zoomed in on the most 
     infinitessimal little lines of the much larger picture.  It became 
     what appeared to be a freeway viewed from the air with mathematical 
     equations relaying back and forth.
     
     I hope my point is clear.  Art and Science synergize continually.  It 
     is not a competition.  Though there are clearly different ways of 
     perceiving by the art-dominant or science-dominant mind, it is an 
     ongoing dance of the fanciful imagination supplying the seed for the 
     mineral-rich and grounded soil.  (like the metaphor?)

     I wonder if the founding fathers in declaring the right of free speech 
     imagined multi-national companies with huge advertising budgets, using 
     creative minds to find the most superficial yet entertaining methods 
     to make alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and eating junk food 
     glamorous, adult, familial, nutritious, etc..?  Somehow I doubt that 
     their vision stretched into our 20th century lifestyle.
     
     Free speech is not an oan all or nothing consideration in my book.  It 
     is leveraged by discernment and the discernment of the collective at 
     that.  And even then, if the decisions of the people are a result of a 
     smoke and mirrors deception by a charismatic leader (say...Hitler or 
     Kohmeni), is it true discernment?  (I've doubled back on myself...a 
     hazard of the overly-philosophical <G>).
     
     We tried prohibition in this country and that didn't work.  I wouldn't 
     vote to reinstate such government restriction and would in fact vote 
     for the legalization of marijuana.  BUT, I see why pot is not 
     legalized after what Corporate America has done with the liquor 
     industry.  Absolute Vodka ads are a stylized pop art form and cleverly 
     conceived at that.
     
     The only thing these ads are good for are their lampoon-ability.  
     Recently, in California, the cowboy-like Marlboro men are now on a 
     billboard with one saying to the other, "Bob, I've got Emphysema."  
     And there's plenty of suffering for the addicts to alcohol as well.  
     
     So, no, with alcohol consumption linked to so much dysfunction, death 
     and destruction, I don't really associate "free speech" with a 
     multi-billion dollar industry's ability to exercise it sensibly, with 
     conscience or any other motive than how much money they can make off 
     their product.
     
     Free speech to me is like freedom to walk in an urban area.  You're 
     safer from the large fast moving objects in the designated cross 
     walks, following a sense of order and cooperation.  And since most of 
     us are living in urban centers, perhaps we need to understand that 
     King George and monarchal threats no longer justify the absolutism we 
     apply, sometimes against the simplest common sense, to assure its 
     application.  Ostensibly, this is a trigger sentiment to some and I'm 
     willing to discuss ramifications I haven't considered in an 
     all/nothing application of the right to say what you want.  In most 
     things in a cooperative democracy, there are limits and not just 
     yelling "Fire" falsely in crowded theater.

Yeah, the motives of legislators and bureaucrats are so much nobler and
purer than the motives of businessmen, we'd better make sure they have
veto power over what gets said. I'd much rather be brainwashed by Bill
Clinton and Newt Gingrich than by Hugh Hefner or Bill Gates, wouldn't
you?

I don't care for capital punishment either, even though I vigorously
support the recognition of a legal right to use deadly force to defend
oneself from threats to one's life. But once you've got someone in 
handcuffs and leg irons, they're no longer a genuine threat to anyone's
life, so it's no fair to go poking them with lethal injections.

I've always thought that ostracism and exile were among the least 
offensive extreme punishments. Of course, people who are into revenge
consider inoffensiveness a disadvantage among punishments.

Careful.  People *KNOW* many things that are false, and it is not
possible to know the future with 100% certainty.  The main thing that
people seem not to know is how probability and statistics and risk
work, and what they most seem to aggrandize is what they will lose on
a given down side.  Surveys show that many (most?) people are more
afraid of public speaking than of death.

A given person can be an optimist in the face of scanty information,
or a pessimist in the face of extensive information.  I think most
people tend towards pessimism, and others towards optimism.  I tell
some people everything I know about cryonics and they say "What if
it doesn't work?".  My reply:  "Maybe it won't, but then nothing's
changed.  The point is, what if it _does_?".

I can't think of any other reasonable position on this issue than that
each person should choose whether the face the risk of capital
punishment.  Under a private law scenario, choosing this risk will
probably save you on law enforcement costs, since other parties will
know they that for the same level of enforcement effort, they can get
more deterrence from this more extreme threat.  It should be up to
each person to decide if this savings is worth the risk.

How will you implement this policy? You can present the milder aspects of
these ideas to non-transhumanists but then, when they look at your web
sites or literature, they will see all those wild ideas. How do you plan to
segment the market? Will you set up different web sites and print different
literature for the different audiences? If so, how do you prevent
crossover? (A quick web search and the non-transhumanists will find the
explicitly transhumanist sites.)

The public image and presentation issue is tremendously important for the
future of our ideas. Apart from Anders' comments on the above questions, I
encourage everyone else to offer suggestions. How do we find the optimal
path between being boring/blending in with other ideas, and standing
out/looking scary.

I'm facing this issue very clearly now as I write my book The Augmented
Animal. I don't want to tone it down yet I'm trying to make the ideas
appealing and reasonable to the average reasonably intelligent reader who
hasn't heard of many of these ideas before. (A tough and smart editor helps
with this!)

Onward!

A quick solution to your problem: get rid of MS. Differently from the real
MS, this condition is commonly deemed curable, requiring only a few week
quarantine. 

Don't use broken tools. Use free software.

The idea of all things having cause and effect is flawed, of course.  You're
always going to end up with a first cause, and who knows what caused it!?
 But nothing you could observe after that initial cause is random.  I would
also argue that the initial cause was not random, because I don't believe
that random events exist.

Information can exist on it, but it does not exist until we create that
information, until we percieve it.  As you said "...according to many of the
most popular interpretations of Quantum Mechanics nothing is anything until
it is perceived".  Information only exists on something once we percieve it,
but it exists 'physically'.  Our consciousness is the processor of
information, our soul is the infomation we process, as you said this is the
only important thing to you.

As you said in earlier post:

>The soul as I understand it is something important, the only important thing

>about me, the only important thing in the universe, is consciousness.

I believe there are two important things about you (and every conscious
being):

Your physical structure, as created by your genes, which shapes your logic.
 The way you process information (your logic circuits).  We could call this
your consciousness.

The information you have processed.  Which changes the way you process
information and shapes yourself.  The information you have processed and who
you are can be considered the same thing.  So i'm going to say this is the
soul.

I believe both of these concepts fall into what you describe as a soul and
consciousness, but in a more direct way.

If a computer processes information, which is an abstract representation of
something physical and alters it's logic according to this information, would
it not be conscious?

I was just trying to point out that, even if we do not percieve the universe
it can still have effect on us.  If you uploaded your consciouness you would
no longer be conscious because you would no longer have a physical world on
which to accumilate information.  As you said, a brain is nothing without
senses, it is also nothing without something to sense.

Peoples perceptions of the universe can be very different.  I remember
hearing about a disorder (I forget the name) that makes people 'see' sound.
 For instance, when a dog barks, these people can see triangles coming out of
the dogs mouth.  I wonder what it would be like to hear what you see? or
smell what you touch?

"What is the extropian stance on punishment? Personally, I am against
the death penalty because I don't believe that two wrongs make a right.
However, the issue takes on an added dimension when, in our envisioned
immortalist future, murder is equivalent to denying someone eternity. What
should the punishment be then?" 

Well, I think execution is the only right punishment for murderers, now and
in the
future. In fact, the whole justice system should be according to the
supremely fair
and consequent "an eye for an eye" principle. The punishment should be like
a mirror
image to the crime. Of course this usually isn't possible for reasons of
practicality, but
it *should* be the basic idea behind every judicial decision.

Of course, c.p. should only exist in an "enlightened Extropian State",
where you can 
actually (more or less) trust the legal authorities and (thus) only the
guilty are punished.

Reasons why to prefer execution over incarceration:

1) It (execution) is a lot cheaper (no endless appeals in the new
system)---Eternal 
imprisonment is  infinitely (!) expensive.
2) It will prevent repetition by the same offender (guaranteed !)---One can
escape from prison 
or get paroled or pardoned by bleeding heart humanists (and kill again).
3) It *probably* has a better preventive function than imprisonment.
4) It satisfies the rightful need for revenge of the freinds & relatives of
the victim 
a lot better than the prison alternative.
5) It is the most rational, fair and consequent punishment for a horrible
crime. 
If someone is killed, his future is taken away from him. Consequently, the
offender 
should have no future either, not even in prison.

The only really valid objection against capital punishment is the fact that
if you
accidentally execute an innocent person, you can't "bring him back".
Fortunately,
we have cryonics. Once (in a couple of decades or so) it is proven that
suspensions
can be successfully "reversed", it could become a standard practice to
"freeze" a
convict after execution. In case of a judicial error (which is btw very
unlikely in an
"Extropian System"), you can revive the victim, make excuses, pay damages,
and
all is well.

Incidentally, I think corporal punishment should be (re-)introduced also.
It is cheap,
effective and very just...

I have nothing against either the site or logo.  However, I do think they
could be used in a more subtle way.  Large computer rendered logos and black
backgrounds do have a very 'sci-fi' feel, image is obviously important and I
think it might be best to take a more subtle approach in design.

How about a larger web presence, a drexlian 'fact forum' for extropian ideas
and information.  I understand that the Foresight Institute are trying this
with a dedicated browser, we could try something similar using better
established web technologies such as Java.

	i am currently of the opinion -- and please play devils advocate 
	here, if any of you has any ideas -- that new ideas more often
	than not ARE scary and frightening to the established order.
	evolution seems to take place among the young.  transhumanist
	ideas are nothing more than a radical (not violent, but swift and
	sure) shift of the human way of life.  max, if you were to offer

	philosophy you are going to frighten and confuse middle america,
	whether you like it or not.

	i'm afraid that if you have something truly revolutionary to say,

	TRANSHUMANISM, you WILL create enemies, you will scare people,
	you will get people accusing you of satan worship, forming a cult,
	or whatever else is fashionable in Tabloid TV.  You will either
	have to shut up, stop publicizing your ideas, or soften your
	ideas if you want to avoid this.

Only if they suggest that the current status quo has to change. If
they are just ideas, then they are usually irrelevant (although many
groups have discovered too late that simple ideas can have unexpected
consequences).

Yes, transhumanism is extremely radical and threatens a lot of
groups. Softening it is IMHO the wrong idea, I think it is better to
introduce it gradually and show how the many reasonable ideas one is
presenting leads to a bigger picture. People can accept the idea of
living healthier using (say) food supplements or calorie restriction.
They can accept the idea of having knowbots making them more
efficient. They can accept the idea of using psychology to develop
oneself. Once they have accepted many of these small ideas it becomes
more natural to accept other ideas (like planning their lives, since
they will live longer), and so on.

No, there is no point (and actually a bit dishonest) to present two
images (a bit like scientology starting out as self-help training and
then turning into a religion). I leave secret teachings for the
initiates of the inner order to the cults. 

It makes a lot of difference if the first impression people have of
transhumanism is somebody speaking about how you can become
smarter/happier/more long lived through some fairly simple tricks
(especially if they can be demonstrated easily) or if it somebody
speaking of uploading oneself into a computer and colonizing the
entire universe. The latter is so far-out that it doesn't matter
other than conversation fodder (if even that), the former is
downright interesting, and can in time lead to discussions about
basic transhumanist philosophy and other practical self-enhancing
methods. 

As I see it, there are three groups of people we want to reach: the
people who are or will become transhumanists, the people who think
transhumanism is a good thing, and the people who accept
transhumanism as a valid view, even if they disagree with it. We need
to enlarge the last group if we are to be able to make our voices
heard in the debate, otherwise we will be seen as simply some lunatic
fringe group of no importance. The second group is of course
important to get public support. Compare this to the environmental
movement: practically everyone today agrees that environmental issues
are relevant, many support environmentalism (albeit passively) and a
small group is active environmentalists.

As a radical idea becomes more acceptable it seems to go through
different phases. At first people find it crazy or ridicullous. Then
it becomes scary and people get angry about it. Then it is new and
suddenly completely mainstream. We have moved from crazy to scary,
and that is a good thing. But there is no doubt that we have
turbulent weather ahead.

Point noted and appreciated. However I'm not even considering
information that is false. If one knows false information I concede that
this is entirely worthless. But at the same time, if one knows true
information, I'm suggesting that as that kind of information increases,
people will be less risk-averse. The conclusion is that perfect
information about all things (omniscience) leads to perfect behavior.
Risk becomes irrelevant.

You're right. But I'll take 99.9% certainty as good enough.

I think you're saying that the more information people have about such
things, the better they will perform. If so, this is precisely my point.

I'm not sure what you're saying here.

Is public speaking a risk? I think so, in a certain way. Now, I'm not
sure that the only reason people are afraid of public speaking is
risk-aversion. I figure self-confidence (a purely mental construction)
is the primary basis. Indeed, when I get up in court, the more
information I have about the law and the facts of the case, the more I
look forward to my argument. Again, where information increases,
risk-aversion decreases, the more sure of yourself you become.

I personally tend towards cynicism. But this only because I'm a stark
optomist. I have such a feeling that mankind is capable of everything
that I can't help a certain arrogance towards the people who are running
our world into the ground.

Is anyone else completely disgusted with the estate tax?

Here in Canada, we use the euphenism "probate tax", but it's still the
same ugly tax.

How can government profit from it's citizen's demise?  Isn't that just an
incentive for government to kill us off.  Obviously it wouldn't be
advantageous for government to kill off a young worker who is contributing
more income tax that s/he could in estates taxes, but for someone older
who is using up free medical benefits, no longer paying income tax, and
sitting on a large estate, why should government care about these people?
And, more relevant to extropy, why would they care about longevity?  It
seems to me that it would be to the government's advantage to cover-up
and dissuade people from conducting longevity research.

I wonder if you get an estate tax refund after you are reanimated from
cryonic suspension ;)

It's quite unsavory indeed.

An estate tax is levied on a person's right to transmit property. The
rationale seems to be that government protects this right with its laws,
and maintains also the infrastructure which facilitates it (probate
court, public records, etc.) This would perhaps warrant (according to
TINSTAAFL) a surcharge on the transaction itself regardless of the
amount being transmitted. Certainly not a percentage tax on the property
itself (unless it varied in accordance with the complexity of the
transaction.) Regardless, most probate courts do charge a small fee and
the other transactional costs are borne entirely by the decedent's
estate or the inheritor's wallet. It's usury plain and simple.

I don't think there is anything cultish about the spiral logo.. I don't
think anyone mistakes a bunch of arrows for a religious symbol.  The only
cultish-extropian thing I've ever experienced on the web was the picture
on your web site (I think it's gone now) of you looking at your watch or
something with a computer generated 3-d landscape in the background.  It's
not neccessarily that this IS a cultish image, but it could be
misinterpreted to be something like the whitewashed picture of that
maharishi guy superimposed on a bunch of clouds.

Personally I want to achieve a variety of tangible things; the only
reliable way of doing that is to concentrate on the tangible, provable and
material aspects of life. I've met zillions of people who dream about and
talk about achieving many things, but few who actually do anything about
it. The latter folks have a high success rate, the former almost zero.

Unfortunately, many new ageish cults have adopted the symbols and 
artistic style that used to be within the domain of those who 
considered themselves pragmatic futurists.  Reading up on Heaven's 
Gate really opened my eyes to the appropriation of verbiage and 
symbology to create a veneer of scientific appropriateness.  

Whether organizations like Extropy should accomodate this and change their 
own style is another question.  Any symbol might be interpreted in a 
cabalistic manner;  why should we limit our artistic expressions?  I 
would rather that effort be put towards correcting these (previously 
discussed) citations of Extropy Institute as a cult and getting hard 
information out about transhumanist thought in general.  

Sin,

This is kind of a tangent, but I thought I'd bring it up.

Often I find I begin to appreciate an artist I didn't originally like once I
understand where they're coming from.  One thing I almost hate is when I read
a foreword to a collection of a comic strip I don't like (yeah, I know, I
read everything).  Often afterwards I start appreciating the strip!
 Sometimes this almost makes me feel used.

I've had similar experiences with my favorite art, music.  Schubert was once
no big deal to me.  But then I got a music professor who explained about
Schubert's playing with keys and some interesting deliberate breaking of
compositional rules.  For example, in one song, Schubert deliberately makes a
beginner's error of going to the dominant too soon to create an atmosphere of
somebody who doesn't know what they're doing (which is the point of that part
of the song).  Now I love Schubert.

"Modern" art (which is not really modern anymore - we need a new name)
generally leaves me cold, no matter how well I understand it.  John Cage can
be interesting, but I don't think he should be listened to - his pieces are
better appreciated as visual or conceptual art.  Some abstract painting
(complex semi-random smears/streaks/etc), however, I now like, as I realized

I have great fondness for Cage.  He first created his music to animation on
Sunset Boulevard above what is now the Whisky A-Go-Go.  There he and Oscar
Fischinger (animator) explored symbolic imaging with sound.  I love what he
did with Ju Ju (African for becoming emerged in the "play" of life - a type
of Action Art where you see what happens next by fully participating in the
art of life.)  Best experienced by the one doing it -;)

Modern Art covers a century of art and many styles and art movements.  Its
roots  can be seen in French 19th-century avant-garde throughout the late
20th Century.  Modern Art subsets such as the Abstract Arts of Cubism,
Abstract Expressionism , Fauvism, etc. are less literal (Impressionism,
etc.)  than symbolic and noted for their design quality and color.
(Mondrian, geometric shapes and monochromatic colors expresses a theory of
universal harmony.)

The Modern Art era completed and there was a fusion of Conceptual Art and
Action Art, Performance Art and other genre's when Technological Art came to
surface.  This was/is a fascinating period of art because we can watch art
create itself vis-a-vis digital evolution and the Electronic Arts (Virtual
Reality, A-Life.)  Simultaneously, Transhumanist  Art (1982)  grew into
Extropic Art (1997) which is an art movement (subsets Automorph Art and
Exoterra Art) combining imagination with critical thought.  Voila!

Thanks for some interesting points. I realized since my last post that the
best solution to the problem would be to live in  a world where it is
*impossible* to kill someone. This could be accomplished by uploading of
backup copies and cloning. In this way we would not have to deal with the
(in my opinion) very difficult ethical question of capital punishment.

I would be all in favor of government thought control to protect the world
from dangerous or erroneous ideas, provided you can prove to me that this new
ministry of truth would have the following 4 properties:
  
1) A ministry of truth that can always tell truth from falsehood.
 
2) A ministry of truth that can always tell when little people like me and 
   you can not handle the truth and so must be lied to.

3) A ministry of truth staffed exclusively by saints so it always has the 
   moral courage to do the right thing and would never abuse its awesome 
   power.

4) A ministry of truth that can magically enforce its edicts on incorrect
   speech even in a world that contains strong encryption, anonymous 
   re-mailers, DC nets and a Internet that spans the globe.

I concede that stupidity can be hazardous to your health, and perhaps it's a

world safe for fools, especially when it would mean less freedom for me.

That cliche originally came from the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes

a man imprisoned for saying America should not be in the First World War.
Years later Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire legal
career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous saying.

aarrrgghhh.... placing things on a continuum, is what I meant by sliding
scale, not a LINE... arrgghhhh, this debate shit makes me crazy . maybe it's
just cuz I suck at it!
Oh., BTW - I have been acused of being emotional, um...
- is that something bad?


Ok, I am not making myself clear: 
imagine a sliding scale of thought in time, not in space...
Imagine perceptions and thoughts as a Stream, not isolated bits of
information or data.
Now:
In this stream, or continuum, we move through our day  - thinking.
In other words, we slide from a high focus logical state: deductive, linear,
used for say, a math problem... then perceptions influence your "thought
stream" - say , a noise behind you...you look behind you and gather some
fresh perceptions, your mental focus slides into a different focus, - your
focus governs the relationship to your thoughts.

Some people, some of the time, percieve the world in a way that fastens on
the details, clipping out interesting detail of a scene, such observers
question and wondr abotu the details. This type of person may go after the
data, for closer inspection.
Some people, some of the time, percieve in a "diffuse "way, simply watching
the world go by... more likey to notive mood and ambiance than to fasten
analytically on particular details. Ths person will be more passive, rather
than go hunting about the landscape huntng for points of interest.
everyone experiences both, and will recognize some aspects of themslves at
least in some measure...

One of these is a high focus state and the other low...
Higher focus people are more comfortable camping out for sustained periods at
the the higher ends of the spectrum. Lowere focus personalities aren't.


When you believe thoughts are bits of data points, then there is a dichotomy,
because you will see it as a bunch of points on a graph paper... 
If you see us as a stream, it will be more of a pattern...

Yes, "cosmythology" really irritates and worries me. It would be
interesting to see how the new age crowd reacted if one used their
terminology to describe something hard and normally considered
unspiritual, like (say)  national economics or bridge building :-)

Exactly. We in Aleph have even bigger problems with this than ExI; 
our logo *is* cabalistic (the hebrew letter Aleph). One solution we
came up with to make the cover of our handbook look non-new age is to
surround it by a plasmid: new age and genetic engineering usually
don't mix (let's ignore Rael for the moment).

I think this is a good idea. We should not let others decide what our
symbols and ideas means, that is up to ourselves.

Really?  Think about this:

>>>physics/general 1 anduril(2791)1may93 5:47 *

"... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, pass-
ions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union of creative
imagination and rational critical thought, I should like to write 'Science'
with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the printer's upper case.

  "Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,
responsible and enlightened beings. 'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the
emancipation of man from self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of in-
capacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a
state of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack of
intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use one's own
intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use
your own intelligence! This is the maxim of the enlightenment.' [ref. 6, 
'Was ist Aufklarung?']


  "Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...


  "The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of
atomic [fission - TH] energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the
long run) have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science
as an 'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our 
physical environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is 
apt to be self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us 
free - if it does not do away with us altogether. And while knowledge is 
worth dying for, power is not. (Knowledge is one of the few things that 
are worth dying for, together with liberty, love, kindness, and helping 
those who are in need of help)."

Unilaterally killing someone is an irretrievable act of aggression -- 
murder, all the worse for being carried out against a captive person with 
no means of self-defence, and who may -- it may transpire -- be _innocent 
of the crime for which they are executed_.

The liberal (word used in its widest sense here) argument against is that 
the laws protecting rightsd should be upheld _with only the absolute 
minimum of violence which may be necessary.


It is quite extraordinary that anarchists or libertarians -- of all people 
-- should endorse the death 'penalty.' All this can lead to in practice is 
assassinations and coldly calculated judicial murders by the State.  Or 
lynch mobs.

That anyone can imagine that this can possibly lead to a more liberal, or 
libertartian, or more anarchist society is *entirely risible*.


[1] Execution itself is _morally indefensdible_.  Ity degrades everyone 
associated with its practice.  That can only serve to degrade the justice 
system itself.  It also in itself violates fundamental laws.

CIA prohibited assassinations for moral and prudential reasons which 
Richard Bissell gives in his autobiography, "Reflections of a Cold 
Warrior"  [Yasle, 1996]. Not least, because it degrades policymaking with 
an 'Off with their head' modality of thought. He was chief economist to 
the Marshall Plan, Deputy Director, Plans at cIA, and President of the 
Institute for Defense analyses at princeton. He studied economics under 
hayek for a year, at LSE, and found him incomprehensible (Hayek's English 
was noe too intelligible back then >:-} ].


[2] It's _unnecessary_: check the murder rates country by country and 
compare them with the execution rates.  Supporters would predict an iverse 
correlation:  but there is none.  In fact, countries with execution are 
frequently _more_ murder-prone.  Every country in Europe is safer than any 
state in the US, AFAIK.


[3] In fully rights based libertarian terms, it's *impossible.*

Reasons:

[a] The accused is tried in court.  The prosecution team, the jury and the 
trial judge(s) must accept personal responsibility for the outcome.  They 
are all subject to execution if they turn out to have got it wrong, and 
have in fact convicted (and thus caused to be executed) an innocent man,


[b] An executioner must be found.  He must be liable to execution should 
his executing the accused should prove factually unwarranted.  You won't 
find one.  The jailers are accessories to murder, too.  Their belief that 
they were somehow 'justified' in conspiring to kill is hardly relevant as 
a defence.

[c] All of the above-mentioned people must also be able to provide full 
and prompt restitution to all the friends, relatives, business associates 
etc., who are themselves gravely damaged by the execution _even though 
they've done nothing wrong_.

[d] Not many candidates for the above-mentioned roles is likely to have 
that sort of money, and no insurance company would carry the risk on their 
behalf.

[e] If it's a statutory death penalty, _all the people who voted for it_ 
are also liable and subject to criminal and civil proceedings.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

Thought-experiment:

You get to vote on the matter, try the case, or execute the person, if -- 
-- and only if -- you agree to  this procedure.

If the man is convicted and sentenced, you must spend a month getting to 
know the accused, and get to know them, their friends, family and 
colleagues. Their unique and irreplaceable selves.

You must then try to learn what really happened, and why.

At the completion of the month, you _have_ to execute the accused _even if 
you believe they're innocent, and you'll destroy the hasppiness of others, 
perhaps deprive the world of irreplaceable talents, and be executed 
yourself into the bargain.

Would _you_ accept these terms?  If not, why not?

Would you ask _anyone else_ to?  Seriously?  How do you think they would 
reply to you?

I used to think a lot about death penalty for murderers as a kid. I then
thought that execution was nonviable, since making executor symmetrical to
its victim. The appropriate solution seemed back then to isolate the
offender irreversibly (in a kid's imagination: whisk away to alternative
universe, planet, etc.) to prevent future damage to the society. 

A friend of mine currently proposes dedicating an (navy-) isolated island
to the terminal criminals, destroying their vessels should they wish to
depart. This takes care of isolation, but is basically sending prisoners
to an ersatz hell during their life time. Since every law enforcement has
a noticeable error rate, this seems inacceptable. 

I see a big problem with death penalties in the US: costs for the death
row prisoner integrated over the entire time are easily sufficient to
maintain him during a life sentence. Unless implementation of death 
sentences is low-overhead, the cost argument is inapplicable.

To reduce costs, I think one might use modern technology for solitary
prisoner containment (with adequate hygiene, food, and media access),
wether automated cells (I don't think anybody can escape from a solid
metal cell with external life suport), or home confinement, automatically
guarded by exploding implants or collars.

Whether above captive maintance expenses are acceptable to the society... 
I dunno. An individual will pay private security to get rid of the 
offender. By whatever means, provided they are cheap.

Why? Somebody has commited an atrocity. If the victims security system is
inadequate, we're forced to believe the evidence gathered by others. If
the evidence is very weighty, that person is probably guilty, and ought to
be permanently isolated from the society. If the code of that particular
society demands execution, and I have been selected randomly for its
implementation (But why?  That should be the job for professional
security?). If I'd be reimbursed for that month of learning the details of
the case (But why? The jury has already investiated the case) I'd do. 

> You must then try to learn what really happened, and why.

That obviously depends on the amount of data, and who has gathered the data.

Then what is the point of that month? If I can't bow out: 1) this code of
this particular society is inacceptable, so one either tries to change the
code, or to depart the society. 2) On above terms: if I live in this
particular society and I get reimbursement for the one month, and a
possibility to bow out should this case appear fishy, I'd be willing to
play the executor. 

> perhaps deprive the world of irreplaceable talents, and be executed
> yourself into the bargain.

Why for? I'd thougt the randomly selected executor's personality would be
held anonymously to protect him from possible violence from relatives? 
What's the point to exposing the executor to attacks from the relatives, 
risking modern equivalent of Scottish highland clan wars? I thought 
current laws were meant as a point of reference (I know get tat if I do 
tit), and to prevent violence runaways, these being detrimental to the 
whole society I am a part of?

> Would _you_ accept these terms?  If not, why not?

I would accept the terms I mentioned above. Not _your_ terms. However, 
I'd rather subscribe to a society with a different code (life long 
imprisonment rather than execution). Talking about execution in an 
immortal society does appear a constructed case. There might be strife and 
conflict even after the Singularity, or there might be none: currently, 
this is idle musings.

First you teach them how to think like a transhumanist.  Discussion of more
radical ideas should be just that, discussion of ideas.  Don't say "this is
how it's going to be" but "it's going to be how you want it to be", then put
them all in a discussion forum and let them decide how they want it to be.

When I read Engines of Creation the first time the thing that had the
greatest effect on me was not the possibilities of nano-technology, but how
it is already used within us.  Making people take a look around them to see
how amazing the world is already will often soften the blow of radical
concepts.

Dear Geoff, Hagbard, Max and other fellow Extropians:

The estate tax -- as well as all other taxes -- including the, albeit,
badly flawed, "progressive" income tax -- were initially conceived about
the time of the First World War, as a method of providing additional
revenue for increased governmental expenses and operations.

An additional and supplimental motivation was the somewhat Keynsian
theory of promoting social change through the re-distribution of the
wealth of an established oligarchy and the creation of greater
socio-economic equality.

As with many, or possibly most, legislative actions the influence of a
controling oligarchy created (primarily through campaign contributions;
See: Bribes) numerous exemptions to the legislation in order to allow
the oligarchy to maintain and transfer their assets to their heirs while
avoiding taxes. 

In a limited democracy, such as the one presently we live in -- but do
not really control to any great extent -- the rule by economic proxy of
an ever changing, but usually self-serving oligarchy, remains a major
determining influence.

Obviously, if an estate tax were to be equitable, it would not include
the exemptions that currently exist, and the revenue generated would be
set aside in a specific account for socio-economic equalization.

The probabilities of this happening under the present campaign financing
scheme are currently slim to none. I suspect however, that they can, and
probably, eventually will be overcome to some extent through a somewhat
Toflerian "Power Shift".

If, in our paradigms, we merge a philosophy of fantasy with one of
reality, and consider the short, as well as the long term, possible
influence of a broad based and somewhat eglectic but still Extropian
philosophy on evolving cultures and society, it might be possible to
slowly alter and expand the extent of the conciousness of humankind.

The effort involved would, obviously, be substantial. 

Can we afford, however, to ignore the current state of our developing
society and simply try to ignore our social, moral and ethical
responsabilities to present and future generations by closing our minds
to the realities of our times and engage in escapism by fully focusing
on our attentions and dreams of a distant but better future?

Dear Fellow Extropians,
Sometimes it's simply circumstances that determine the degree of

It may occur to some that both Rick and Mark are partially correct.

Posibly, in the diversity of opinion and the variables of circumstances

Dear fellow Extropians,

Could it be that there is some confusion between stupidity and
ignorance?

There is a difference between those who do are unenlightened and have
not yet, but are willing to learn, and those who have been taught to
fear knowledge and therefore will not learn beyond the limitations
imposed upon them by their culture.  

Is it possible that given the appropriate circumstances we call all
learn far more than we have been taught?

Is it possible that rather than reject democracy as a system we can
learn to adapt the prevailing system to provide for full participation?

Quo Vadis?

I don't believe in jail or execution. Why? Because I don't believe in
the notion of State enforced criminal law -- being an anarchist who
doesn't believe in the benefits of the State, this should be an
obvious stance.

What *do* I believe in? Torts. I don't see why there should be any
real distinction between what happens if you break a contract, break
a piece of my personal property, or break my leg -- I should sue you
for damages, and get restitution. This is essentially a return to the
early legal systems much of Europe had, before kings discovered that
declaring certain offenses to be violations of the *KING'S* peace and
not torts was a way to earn a buck by collecting the fines for the
crown instead of for the victim.

In the context of a tort based legal system, "jail" and "execution"
become meaningless concepts. The issue is restitution, pure and
simple.  This might, of course, effectively result in most murderers
being effectively enslaved for decades or even their entire lives
making restitution to their victims, but I see nothing inherently
wrong with that. If you cause damage, you have an obligation to make
good on it. Damage is a matter between victim and tort feasor.

For others who influenced my viewpoint, see Friedman's "The Machinery
of Freedom" and Benson's "The Enterprise of Law".

        But what is to hold them to it?  What keeps a murderer from
murdering the family of the victims in the time that he is supposedly making
restitution?  I think that for violent crimes like rape, battery, assault,
murder etc., the best way to take care of it is with (as Eric Watt Forste
said) handcuffs and leg irons.  However, should the judgment not be wholly
circumstantial?  I, personally, see that in some instances murder should not
be a crime (rape and battery etc. are another story).  So the question turns
from "What should be done?" into "Who gets to decide?"  I am reminded of
Heinlein's "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" in which a witness to a crime
assembles some passer-bys to bring forth a judgment.  Both sides present a
case, and a decision is made in a short amount of time.  This way, a person
who is declared "innocent" does not have to suffer through many months of
invasive incarceration as frequently happens in our legal system today.

        As for the future, I would imagine that a drug would be found that
could provoke the truth from a suspect.  BTW, I am all for capital
punishment as long as it is based on circumstance and situation, and as long
as it is implemented honestly.

Interesting idea. As a neuoscientist, I'm a bit sceptical about
whether this is possible even in principle - we are not very good at
distinguishing real and imagined memories, so under some
circumstances even a "perfect" truth drug would fail (although fMRI
studies may help here). The problem also lies in whether something as
simple as a drug could compel truthfulness; we might need invasive
nanodevices.

A quibble, but hopefully a useful one to remember:  It probably isn't
exactly "idle" to speculate that strife and conflict will persist in the
aftermath of "the" singularity.  Gerald Feinberg's Promethian chestnut,
namely that "[e]verything will be accomplished that does not violate known
fundamental laws of science, as well as many things that do violate those
laws," has to be false, strictly speaking, to the extent that there are
indefinitely many outcomes that are at once logically possible but
mutually exclusive.  Any development toward a technological elimination of
the distinction between the "real" and the "discretionary" will be
asymptotic at best because the obstacles to instrumental success are not
exclusively problems of engineering, but are (ever more conspicuously with
the maturation of the sciences and the expansion of the instrumental power

takes up the task of extermination with any kind of regularity.  Surely?

AMongst ourselves substance should be of paramount inportance, but we
all know that the media and the ignorant masses put a much higher value
on image than anything else. In this age, how your enemies define you is
often how you are perceived by all. If we are to have any usefull effect
on our society, we must not treat these as mutually exclusive.
Overwhelming emphasis on substance is just as shallow/lazy  thinking as
only focusing on image.

Well, I don't think that email tag lines have much to do with list 
discussion, but that is a joke perpetrated by a dear friend of mine 
wherein we have been satirizing the "men are from mars, women from 
venus" mentality.  My own:  men are from toaster ovens, women, microwaves.

Yes.  This also ties into something I was thinking about this morning 
as I dragged my weary rear to a protest rally, in that the extent of 
the Extropian commitment to E-prime may render the process of 
image-making a bit difficult.  Our media tends to fall into the 
programmatic 'I am', and activists utilize this to get points across 
succinctly.  You adopt a political identity and render your own self 
as the image of that identity, thereby providing both a visual 
reinforcement of the verbal message.  And that political identity can 
change according to the issue at hand, but because it is only a 
temporary rendering and not a permanent life state, you can step out 
of it in private.  I've been wondering the extent to which Extropians 
who are in the media spotlight utilize this strategy, and I have 
pondered it in relation to my own contributions to the Internet 
Political Report.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

And I thought that meant Bovine Spongiforme Enzephalopathy, also known
as Mad Cow Disease. Maybe that's why that thread seems a bit crazy to
me.

If any such entity exists it will not care about your ridiculous
economic thinking, like having the universe full of stars is a waste of
energy. Transcending the human condition implies thinking capabilities
much higher than that of you and me.

Energy and time are the least important values to such an entity.
Information is the most important one. Bringing an universe into "order"
would mean destroying an information source, for no purpose. It's not
the calculating power that counts. If it was, the computers of today
would already rule the world. It's the information processed and the
external sensors that count.

Not infinite power, but infinite knowledge is probably the purpose of
any such entity. 

Virtual realities are insufficient if you want to discover physical laws
formerly unknown to you. You can simulate any reality, but if you don't
know the complete physics, you can't simulate the one necessary. You
must do experiments with the "real" reality. Not experiments damaging
it, but watching it with your sensors and taking care of not being
watched.

I am sorry to tell you all those entities will be and are non-Extropian
and non-Libertarian, and they will and do definitely not care about
money or economy. Otherwise, we would not exist.

And presumably it's written by someone who doesn't know much about the

I seem to recall someone asking about ion drives a few weeks ago, but
can't find the post in my archives. Looks like ESA are considering
building one for an asteroid mission (unless I'm mistaken as to what they
mean by 'solar-electric').

Hardly; in an anarcho-capitalist society you have a choice as to whether
you subscribe to a legal system which allows capital punishment. Since
this may reduce the associated costs of the system many people probably
would. I probably wouldn't, but my decision would depend on the 
difference in price.

And because foreign leaders might then 'bring the war back home' by
killing US politicians rather than US conscripts.

Or, perhaps, more murder-prone countries are more likely to execute
criminals in an attempt to reduce the murder rate.

Not true; several US states are 'safer' (in terms of lower murder rates)
than some European countries. If you're not an inner-city drug dealer then
most US states are comparable to most European countries.

I suspect the Extropian approach would be to back them up prior to
execution so that you could reinstate them if you were wrong. Of course
it's far from ideal, but it's better than killing them permanently; though
a smart criminal would back themselves up before undertaking a crime just
in case they're caught.

I published a paper in an IEEE Proceedings on CA modeling of these structures.
I'll put it on my website pretty soon.

I am not sure if Joe Michael (he is essentially Robodyne) thought it up
independently or not (nor do I care). See the "Me n Joe" post.

This little essay isn't finished yet, but some on these lists
 may find it entertaining anyway.


==========================================================

Me 'n' Joe and Those Crazy Little Cubes
Copyright (c) 1997, Forrest Bishop, All Rights Reserved

    It is often the case with inventions that two or more people come 
up with the 
same thing at the same time. This particular instance involves cubes 
that run 
around with each other.

    In 1991 or so, I hit upon the idea of a nanoscale device made up of 
cubes or 
other kinds of space-filling polyhedra that are able to move with 
respect to one 
another. The initial design was a cube, one thousand atoms on a side. I 
thought up 
some of the devices and "Modes of Motion" these cells could execute at 
that time.
    In 1992, when *Nanosystems* came out, I immediately snapped up a 
copy and 
did a preliminary skim. On page 416, Eric Drexler speaks of  assembling 
large 
objects out of building blocks, noting that "Blocks of sufficient size 
and 
complexity (e.g. containing a computer, motor, and actuators) could be 
made self-
assembling, although at a substantial penalty in properties such as 
strength-to-
density ratio." On the facing page (page 417), Figure 14.3 illustrates 
"Expansion 
of a eutatic environment....using sliding blocks..."
   "So", I said to myself, "it appears this idea is already being 
pursued (as is the 
case with more than  90% of the stuff  I come up with), and I need not 
waste my 
time with it.", and went on to other things. I try not to 'get married' 
to my ideas.
   The years passed, I conceived of other things nanotech, and in  
November, 1995 
decided to attend the Fourth Foresight Conference, specifically to 
determine 
which of these projects were dead issues, and which might be pursued 
further. I 
hadn't heard anything more about cubes or such in those years.
   In the parking lot at the conference, I met and spoke with Jeff 
Soreff, and 
mentioned the little cubes. He told me he had recently heard of 
something similar, 
and promised to email a pointer, which he did. This put me in touch 
with Tihamer 
Toth-Fejel, editor of  *The Assembler*, whom had published an article 
on 
"Shape-Changing Robotic Cubes", by Joseph Michael [new website]. After 
some 
very encourging email exchanges with 'Tee', I decided that my ideas 
were still 
relevant, and significantly different from Michael's. I wrote up "The 
Construction 
and Utilization Space-Filling Polyhedra for Active Mesostructures" (Dec 
7, 1995), 
and posted it at my new website,
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb
   Some central differences between the proposals involved the scale of 
the cubes, 
or "Active Cells", which I proposed be mesoscopic, atomically precise 
structures 
vs. Michael's macroscopic cubes, that they slide without detaching 
normally 
(Patent Pending), that the exterior surfaces have few or no moving 
parts, and that 
the faces be complimentary, rather than identical.
   I was now in a polyhedral frame of mind again,  and also came up 
with a 
possible "Universal Assembler" based on the "Active Cell" concept in 
January, 
1996, and a type of interstellar space probe.

Yeah, but at the present time it's difficult to sue someone when you're
dead.

 Dear fellow extropians,

Why is it that I am never amazed at the lengths people go to to
rationalize the taking of another persons life?

Those of us who have been in combat know far too well what taking a life
is all about.

Can we please end this absurd string right here?

Thanks,

Nothing caused the first cause, otherwise it wouldn't be the first cause.

Why not? If event B has no cause it just means that there does not exist an

If it was not random that means it had a cause so it can't be the initial  
cause. Either some things are random or, if you want to preserve determinism, 
there in an infinite chain of cause and effect and no initial cause.

The Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics may be the most popular 
with most but it is not my personal favorite, that doesn't mean it can't be 
true but it just seems to me to be passing the buck, it never tells us  
exactly what an observer is or what perception is.  Can anything less than a 
human pass for an observer as far as Quantum  Mechanics is concerned, what 
about an ape or a dog or a mouse or a bug or a camera or a computer?  

Everett's interpretation does not have to explain perception because it has 
nothing to do with the it, the same is true of John Cramer's Transactional  
Interpretation, or David Bohm's Pilot Wave Interpretation.  
	   

	>Information only exists on something once we percieve it, but it         
	>exists 'physically'.  
	   

If the Copenhagen interpretation is correct then information can not exist  
without consciousness and consciousness can not exist without information, 
this certainly doesn't lead to your conclusion that only meat can be 
conscious.


	>If you uploaded your consciouness you would no longer be conscious

We accumulate information from our senses, process it with our brain and  
store in into memory, we also take old data from memory, reprocess it, and 
return it to memory, an Upload would do exactly the same thing.
	   

	>As you said, a brain is nothing without senses          


I didn't say it was nothing, just that an intelligence without senses can't 
detect time or space.  And anyway, why can't an upload have senses?

What?! I interpret this to mean that you can subscribe to what people
call "legal systems" and still be an anarchist. If I'm wrong, tell me.
My point, based upon what I understand anarchism to be, is that if you
subscribe to a "legal system" created by another, you are not an
anarchist. As an anarchist you are advocating a return to the state of
nature (which may or may not be a good thing). 

I have to admit that IMO, anarchism is not the be-all and end-all of
human existence. Hobbes' Leviathan convinced me of that years ago. But I
do want to hone my views. Please, anarchist apologists, convince me
you're right.

Of course there is another possibility; they don't exist... Since the kind
of technologies we're predicting in the next few centuries are so powerful
and we can see no reason why we shouldn't colonize the entire galaxy in a
million years or so this implies to me that there aren't any other
technological societies in this galaxy (or universe, if intergalactic
travel turns out to be easy). The fact that we look out and see silence
across the galaxy shouldn't be surprising; if there was anyone else to
talk to they'd already be here and we would never have evolved.

Describe to me a random event, any event that you (or anyone else) believes
to be completely random..

An infinite chain of cause and effect would do nicely.  I doubt it is exactly
this, but it's the closest we can percieve, being a part of the universe
means we can never be an outside observer and thus never understand it fully.

I believe that any machine, meat or otherwise, that is adaptive has some form
of consciousness.  Adaptive meaning that it processes information and alters
itself to it's surroundings accordingly.  That includes people, dogs, apes,
plants and even some computers.  The only problems I can see are with
consciousness as software, i'm unsure as to the level of abstraction possible
(can we save consciousness as a set of rules or do we need to simulate every
last atom).

I withdraw that comment, even if we do not simulate a physical world, we can
adapt ourselves to percieve computer data, information, etc. in much the same
way as we percieve physical things now.

Please don't post HMTL to the list; it's annoying, wastes bandwidth and
very hard to read. It's particularly annoying when you also quote the
entire post you're replying to for no obvious reason. 

To get back to what I think is your point from what I can decipher of the
HTML: 

I was probably wrong about economics; Friedman argues for a system of
fines as Perry was discussing earlier, since execution only loses you
money whereas fines recover the costs. 

There's a big difference between combat and capital punishment, at least
in an anarchist society. In combat you probably don't really want to be
there and you're shooting at someone else who'd much rather be at home
watching TV. In an anarcho-capitalist society if you voluntarily sign up
with a legal system which allows capital punishment and then commit a
capital crime, you have little to complain about when they kill you. Of
course if a crime is committed on such a person by someone from another
legal system the arbitrator might decide to allow a death penalty, but
that's only likely to happen in extreme cases. Unlike the current monopoly
law an anarchistic arbitrator requires a reputation for fairness and
honesty in order to operate. 

While claiming that all killing is bad is very noble, at some stage you
have to accept that some people are so badly programmed that you have the
choice of either destroying their personality or destroying their body as
well (personally I don't see a great deal of difference between the two).
To give a topical example; what else can you do with someone like Pol Pot,
who's clearly demonstrated their desire and ability to kill millions of 
people?

The problems with dumbocracy are fundamental, and cannot be corrected; 
the basic idea is that a small group of badly informed people hundreds or
thousands of miles away are better qualified to judge situations than
those who are directly involved. All that 'full participation' will do is
to give this judgement power to millions of badly informed people rather
than hundreds. Personally I think that's much worse.

1. The family have guns and he'll probably be shot.

2. The claim would merely pass on to someone else, who'd take more care 
when collecting it.

3. If the family think he's likely to try to kill them they'd simply sell 
the claim at a discount to someone who is better able to collect. This 
might become the normal order of business; sell the claim at 75% of face 
value to a collection agency who'd pursue it themselves. That way the 
family are guaranteed to get most of the money immediately.

4. In a Friedman-like system he'd probably become an outlaw and anyone who 
wished could kill him without fear of legal reprisals.

So there are good reasons to pay up.

Murder is by definition a crime; homicide is another matter.

First you'll have to define 'truth' and demonstrate that we even know what
the 'truth' of an event is (see the traditional 'banana murder' psychology
experiment; 'shoot' someone with a banana and most witnesses will see a
gun instead).

On the contrary, the $33 million judgement against OJ Simpson shows that
if you can't take it with you, your family can at least profit mightily
from your bad luck.

        Then why not kill him in the first place?  If someone presents a
significant (and proven) danger to others, then why risk the safety of the
family?  If someone murdered my son, daughter, sister or anyone close to me,
I would not even dream of wanting that person around.  I'm sure that
rationality would be quite blind to me for awhile, and I would probably take
it into my own hands to kill him.

>4. In a Friedman-like system he'd probably become an outlaw and anyone who

        But still, letting him roam freely would be jeopardizing others; why
compromise the safety and life of others when it is truly unnecessary?
"Claim" or no, I still value my life more than my money...I think most
people are that way.  Perhaps I am slightly unclear on your concept --I have
not read any of Friedman's books-- but from what I can tell, it seems that
you are advocating a claimed parole on dangerous offenders.  If I am
mistaken, please correct me.  What I want to emphasize is that execution and
incarceration are sometimes necessary...though most certainly not
state-sanctioned.  If someone decides to take other people's lives away, why
should he be able to walk away freely?  If he caused a family pain, grief,
and a lifetime of longing for their lost relative, should there not be an
effect.  As I said in my last post, all crimes are committed with different
circumstances; what I advocate is to find a fair way to judge the
circumstances and make a subsequent decision.  The only question is *how*.

Has he come out? What about the recent mandatory key-surrender bill and
the new one to ban 'bomb-making information' on the Net (which means that
the Congressional Record would have to be withdrawn). Will he veto those
if they're passed? Methinks he's just changing his mind for political points 
now that the CDA's failure is clear.

I still think you put too much faith in the Chinese government. The 
situation there seems to be going the opposite way to Russia; instead of 
a government collapse followed by a change-over to a more free-market 
system we're seeing a change-over to a more free-market system followed 
(probably) by a government collapse.

So then the problems with dumbocracy can be corrected. Keep all people
well-informed.

So why am I writing about a game which was first released four years ago?
Well, I'm too stingy to spend $50-80 on a game, so I tend to buy them
later for $20 or so, and at the time the recommended hardware requirements
(486/50 + 8MB of RAM) were far too high for any computer I had access to. 

The game itself is basically a flying-around-shoot-em-up, though more
realistic than most, but the interesting aspect is the background. It's
kind of an anarchist 'Top Gun', with the US falling apart into seperate
states and mercenary fighter squadrons battling against collapsing nations
and the dreaded IRS ('We know where you live -- and where your kids hang
out too'). 

It has a very anti-authoritarian feel; missions include locating and
shooting down the director of the IRS and attacking the local goverment
for increasing taxes, and at the moment my squadron is protecting the
Hawaiian Seccessionists from US Navy attacks. 

Anyway, I thought it made a pleasant change from battling the evil
Russkies, or, these days, the evil terrorists. If you're a frustrated
fighter pilot at heart and have $20 to spare, it's worth a go. 

Anyone know of any other games out there with a similar background?

Can anyone recommend a relatively inexpensive and effective antioxidant or
antioxidant formula?  Has anyone experienced any significant or
interesting health benefits from an antioxidant?  My friend's father took
a relatively new antioxidant and it turned his eyes from blue to brown,
and so far they haven't changed back!  I'd prefer to avoid a side-effect
like that, but I am interested in taking a supplement to reduce free
radical damage beyond what is available in a standard multivitamin.

thank you,

A photon polarized at 45 degrees encounters a polarizer set at 90 degrees. 
Only 2 things can happen, the photon can pass through the polarized 
completely unharmed or it can be stopped completely, modern Science has no 
way of predicting which will happen, the probability is exactly 50, 50. 
You could say there might be some cause that we just haven't found yet, 
but experimental results have proven that Bell's inequality is violated, 
so if there is such a cause it must be non local. A  non local "cause" would 
not weaken with distance, it could instantly change something on Earth even 
if the "cause" was 10 billion light years away and do so without changing 
anything between here and that distant location.  It would also mean that
reverse causality is real, the reason of you just won a thousand dollars at 
the roulette table is a cause that has not happened yet and will not happen 
for a million years. A non local cause would be utterly bizarre, so different 
from our everyday meaning of "cause " that we'd really need to  invent a new

I am definitely missing something. 

How can an anarchist speak of law or legal systems? 

Who makes tort law, who decides tort law, and who enforces tort law? It
seems to me that the very state you hate does all of this. So then is
your beef with the state itself, or is it rather with the laws it makes?

There's more to say, but I'm interested in your rejoinder.

This is a remarkable assertion. Are you in regular communication with these
entities?

I will confine myself to remarking that "...definitely do not care about...
economy" is tantamount to saying "nothing is scarce to these entities".

Sounds fabulous... in both senses.

This has been posted to the technocracy list, as a reply to my request
regarding the goals of technocracy.  Could somebody please comment on
these guys' approach validity? I know that the loss of jobs due to
automation problem is real, probably forcing us to do some (discriminate!)
wealth redistribution over long. However, I somehow fail to see how below
approach should solve any problems at all...

Subject: TECHNOCRACY

Hello Karpal -- or Eugene Leitl -- or whoever.  Do you know zero about
Technocracy???  I know you can access their website at
http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/technocracy if you haven't read any of this
for all their official statements, but putting it my own words, what
Technocracy would be about is THE ANSWER to North America's [and
eventually our planet's] financial fiscal crises -- which have grown
worse with fifty years on Red Ink-o-nomics of WW II.

Technocracy's goal is to aid in the GREAT SWITCHOVER from fiscal
accounting of GNP to energy accounting system of ECO*nomics --
calculating everything in actual quantity produced by the amount of
energy [KWTS, ergs, BTU's instead of IOU's] on a total and a per capita
so that everyone in a geographic area would be supplied plenty of the
Earth's natural resources as well as those manufactured.

The BIG DIFFERENCE in today's manufacture, as well as agriculture, from
a century ago is the use of sophisticated technology instead of muscle
power -- especially with the 20th century's advent of KWTS -- and yet
we're still trying to price people when they perform only 2% of the
labor of today's world of push buttons and automation.

To sum it up -- The Summit of Eight are meeting in Denver to try a
fiscal fix when our real problem is perpetuating the PRICE/PROFIT SYSTEM
which perpetuates pollution and poverty -- while Wall Street and
Washington are going crazy on IOU's, the rest of are trying to survive
alive on the WAGE GUAGE which actually rations food/ housing/ medical
care / education instead of equitably calculating HOW MUCH STUFF VS HOW
MUCH POPULATION.

I know I'm putting this in simple terms, but Technocracy's goal is to
help implement this DESIGN which was developed by 300 top researchers
who took INVENTORY of North America's resources and minerals to see if
we could support our INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION which tends to gobble up
resources much faster than the 19th century hand-tool pace.

THE PROBLEM IS -- in Six Decades of publications, lectures and meetings,
not many Americans seem to understand what Technocracy is all about.

Just last week President Clinton in San Diego was talking about equality
of races -- whereas the DESIGN of a Technate of The Americas would
assure more equality than any money system ever has or could -- for
everyone would be assured their share [by choice not price] of whatever
our GNP would be in consumables and housing would no longer be by
mortgage -- so everyone would enjoy the best quality and most
sustainable.

You refer to Hayek and I've, for many years, received THE FREEMAN
economics journal [which is not about economics but financial] and Hayek
is discussing ways to make the dollarsign system work -- when the actual
fact is that KWTS changed forever the way people and machines WORK --
yet we're still attempting to price everything as if we're all still on
the farms and making stuff by hand -- which we aren't.

Did you just recently come into the Technocrat/Technocracy loop?  

In simple terms, Technocracy proposes MEASUREMENT by quantity instead of
PRICE -- I just spoke with a man this morning about how many KWTS his
household consumes and he couldn't tell me except in dollarsigns.  It's
awfully hard to get folks to think in terms of quantity instead of
price.

Entirely different from politics [which takes money and lots of it] the
physical lines of production crossed in 1913 [Chart on Brief No. 28]
going upward while the number of hours to produce unit of product went
downward from 14 hours a day to what we promote now -- and had zero to
do with who was President or banking -- these are physical facts.

There are INFLECTION POINTS in pig iron or automobiles where things take
an S-curve -- CEO Andrew Grove of INTEL Corp. told Commonwealth Club
several years ago that when INTEL hit the Inflection Point he had to lay
off not the usual 10% but a third of their workers and close down a
third of their plant.  [and IBM was hoping Intel would take over some of
their closed factories...no way.]

His message to the Commonwealth Club and to AMERICA, was that AMEERICA
has now reached its inflection point.

I'd like to see the Citizens rise up peacefully with a CITIZENS' BALLOT
for a new accounting system based on Technocracy's Energy Accounting
which has all been researched before we were born -- based on a DESIGN
which would prove ecologically sustainable -- for we all recognize that
our present M.O.N.E.Y. SYSTEM of Man-ipulating Of Nation's Economic
Yield as if there is not enough to go around, is not equitable and
doesn't consider some people as human beings deserving of even a roof
over their heads or appropriate food let alone education unless you can
afford $25,000 and cerdtainly health care becomes prohibitive for 40
millions.

What do YOU see as a better way to IMPLEMENT the best of what has
already been designed for North Americans to live well, but not as
wastefully?

Where do you fit into all this?  JQS

Beta decay. A neutron in a nucleus changes into a proton, an electron, an
antineutrino and some energy (released as one or more gamma photon(s)). 
The proton stays behind in the nucleus, the other particles leave.

Sit a single atom of a suitable isotope in a levitation cell (laser beam
crossfire). 
Wait. 
The exact time it takes for the beta decay to be observed is random--the
odds are 50-50 each half-life.

Or so they say.

Danny asked about studying the biology of cells.

Rather than searching the web, I would recommend that you purchase a copy
of the excellent textbook by Bruce Alberts et.al. titled " Molecular
Biology of the Cell" 3rd. edition (1994) Published by Garland Publishing
Inc.

Most major bookstores have it.

There seem to be some controversy about antioxidants since the
negative results reported in NEJM last year, and some positive
results published later. At present it is uncertain if (say) vitamin
C or E does some good or not (beside their obvious uses), but it is
clear that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables promotes a longer
and healthier life, possible due to antioxidants or other substances.

You are correct, you are missing something. In Anarcho- Capitalism, there 
would still be police and there would still be law, but it would be private 
police and private law. PPL's (privately produced law) in a anarchic world 
would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes 
among PPA's would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both 
parties BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can happen 
today. When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on 
who will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants 
to get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. The 
arbitrator would be paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, 
it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over 
another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and 
would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and 
juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. 
                      
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing 
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence 
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in 
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect
the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not 
such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not 
used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.
                      
I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich man's PPA 
makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my 
mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need 
one hell of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is 
expensive because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages 
it will need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for 
all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely 
limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could
never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to 
outspend a PPA that had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. 
A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer 
than all the yacht builders on the planet combined. 
                      
No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the 
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one 
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans 
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,  
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically .    
                      
In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to 
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as 
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be 
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%. 
As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that 
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you 
(like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man 
one vote.

Uh, yes. I think you need to read David Friedman's work; try

No, as an anarchist you have a choice as to which legal system you 
subscribe to, or not to subscribe to any (but then you're in a free fire 
zone).

Read 'The Machinery Of Freedom'; it will do a much better job and avoid 
cluttering the list. You also might like to consider changing your
pseudonym, since 'Hagbard Celine' was a confirmed anarchist.

Unfortunately,  I don't believe this is true.  There have evolved 
systems of memes whose *sole* purpose is to get you to value killing 
the other guy *more than your own life* (let alone net worth).  
Examples include certain muslim beliefs about jihad and paradise,  
the christian Crusades, Maoist revolutionary theory, and the 
extremely sophisticated psychological manipulation in Army and Marine 
basic training.  "A rational army *would* run".

I think this severely undercuts the economic arguments for PPL's.  I 
do have hope that a society of long living individuals will make PPLs 
possible, though.  Its no accident that historically, war and 
revolution have relied on teenagers who have little concept of their 
own mortality.

Ah, but what if you can con someone else into paying the price for 
you?

Well, that's not saying much.  Any 14 year old with dreams of glory

I see you haven't been paying attention. "Dead People" are
participants in lawsuits every day even in our current legal
system. Ever notice those words "The Estate Of" in a lawsuit?

Even if you have no family to sue on your behalf, under a suitable
legal regime your executors or others may be enlisted to do so for
you.

Leg irons and guys with upleasant weapons, presumably.

There are other mechanisms available, too. See "Njal's Saga".

Easily. Many places and times have operated without states but with
legal systems. Law does not require a State, any more than building
roads or delivering mail requires a State.

In medieval Europe, commercial law was entirely developed in private
courts without any power of state based enforcement behind them -- and
yet it worked well, and the Lex Mercatoria is the basis for all modern
commercial law.

In medieval Iceland, there was no "public" law enforcement at all --
all law enforcement was private. And yet, there was law.

If you want to learn more on this topic, I suggest "The Machinery of
Freedom" by Friedman and "The Enterprise of Law" by Benson as good
starting points.

<There seem to be some controversy about antioxidants since the

that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables promotes a longer and
healthier life, possible due to antioxidants or other substances.>

The following URL 
http://pio06.urel.berkeley.edu/documentation/Packer.html
provides information on the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid and its
role in the bodys anitoxidant recycling process:

<What [Lester] Packer has fleshed out in recent years is how
alpha-lipoic acid and other antioxidants interact in a complex
recycling process in the body. He showed several years ago, for
example, that vitamin E "recycles" vitamin C in the body; that is,
after vitamin E has disarmed or oxidized a free radical, vitamin C can
come along and return vitamin E to fighting form. The two vitamins
thus work together to prevent free radical damage in the body, Packer
says. Since then he and his colleagues have shown that, in turn,
vitamin C can be recycled by glutathione, an antioxidant produced only
in the body. The cycle continues with another antioxidant, NADPH -- a
coenzyme, or chemical essential to the action of other enzymes --
recycling glutathione. 

Despite this detailed understanding of the antioxidant cycle, when
Packer and other researchers tried to boost antioxidant levels to
determine whether they can protect against disease, they were unable
to find a way to increase glutathione levels. Glutathione cannot be
taken by mouth like vitamins C and E because it is broken down in the
stomach before it reaches the bloodstream. Alpha-lipoic acid proved to
be the missing link, Packer says. Not only does it act as an
antioxidant itself, it also stimulates production of glutathione,
giving cells a double dose of antioxidant. It also is easily absorbed
when taken orally, and once inside cells is quickly converted to its
most potent form, dihydrolipoic acid.

Because both alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid are
antioxidants, their combined actions give them greater antioxidant
potency than any natural antioxidant now known, Packer says. He notes
another property of alpha-lipoic acid that makes it a great
antioxidant. Since it is soluble in both water and fat, it can move
into all parts of the cell to neutralize free radicals. Vitamin C, on
the other hand, is limited to the watery parts of cells because it is
soluble only in water; while vitamin E is soluble only in fat and
sticks to the fatty parts of cells.

Packer says alpha-lipoic acid also is important in cell metabolism, or
the production of energy inside the cell. Without alpha-lipoic acid,
cells cannot utilize sugar to produce energy and they shut down. This
makes alpha-lipoic acid a metabolic antioxidant, able to draw on the
cell's own metabolism to magnify its protective effects and that of
other antioxidants.>

Seconded. Friedman's book is surely the best single source. My own
introduction back in 1981 was Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty. I'd
still recommend Rothbard as a secondary source. Where he goes wrong is in
expecting all agencies to enforce his libertarian constitution. Friedman
instead applies economic analysis to argue that the agencies would have
incentive leading them to a highly (but not 100%) libertarian result.

I was surprised at Hagbard's unfamiliarity with anarcho-capitalism. I took
it that the original Hagbard Celine (my favorite character in Shea and
Wilson's Illuminatus!) was an anarcho-capitalist. That book has a special
place with me, since it's the first place I ever heard of libertarian
ideas. I thought, to my frustration, that they were only fictional until I
came across an ad for The Alternative Bookshop in London. In 1981 I sent an
inquiry to them and received a bunch of leaflets with titles like "Taxation
is Theft". I bought For a New Liberty, then Nozick's Anarchy, State, and
Utopia and was hooked! (At that time the number of libertarians in England
probably didn't exceed 300.)

Apart from introducing me to anarcho-capitalism through the fictional
Hagbard, I have to thank Robert Anton Wilson for first showing me that
cryonics was done for real, through the sad story of his daughter Luna's
suspension in Cosmic Trigger. Anyone else find their way to these ideas
through Wilson?

Onward!

I can't see much difference between "calculating power" and
"information processed", but what you seem to be saying is that
communication is more important than computation. If I understand
you correctly, I agree with you on the abstract point.

I don't understand the part where you seem to be insisting that
money and trade are not modes of communication. It's obvious to me
that these are indispensable modes of communication.

Can you explain to us what the difference between these two
things is? Or are you engaging in empty rhetoric?

Execution is, in my opinion, not cruel and unusual punishment, it is
escape. Given that man is a wild animal, roaming free in his natural
environment, then permanent incarceration in isolation is the very worst
thing you can do to a man.

By whose definition? Not by the Right to Die movement. How is the value
of a terminally ill persons life any less valuable than, say, Bill
Gates? By some transhumanist theory, by all accounts we could easily be
living in a pocket universe simulation run by a quantum computer in
another universe. By this definition, the value of life here is pretty
meaningless.

Only if they want to be well informed. The right to be an ignorant fool
is a well recognized, if informal right here in the US.

TOday, people associate a tyrant and tyranny with autocratic or
totalitarian rule, when the original title was applied to rulers who
appealed to the masses as populists, seeking to outmaneuver the landed
gentry, the ruling aristocracy. For this reason, people like Buchanan
and Clinton, Perot and Forbes can all be considered tyrants or aspiring
tyrants. For this, one must fear the tyranny of the masses more than
some tin pot dictator, for popular injustice is more legitimate in the
eyes of history than injustice by rule of one.

For this reason, I personally would support instant democracy only in a
society of a certified well informed populace. I prefer Plato's
intellectual technocracy to a fully enfranchised populace.

Will not pay? Thats a mere matter of enforcement. In an electronic age,
a warrant should serve to seize electronic assets. It will be
interesting if the New York mobsters and their families can successfully
use the system to track down Sammy "the Bull" Gravano and any money he
may have made from his recently published biography "Underboss" (a good
read, BTW).

Cannot pay? Excuse me? Almost every headline criminal in the past decade
has written or participated in the writing of novels, screenplays, etc.
about their case. New York's Son of Sam Law is a good blueprint.

As I also said in that message, expressing remorse would be expected. I
would expect that criminals would have the choice themselves of either
being executed if they refused remorse, or imprisonment from life on
downward with remorse and a commitment to restitution. A truly guilty
criminal without remorse is merely a mad dog to be put down.

That is the problem, isn't it? Unfortunately, people have limited bandwidth
and they don't strain it very hard on the input side (though many people
do a bang-up job on the output side). There is an awful lot of information
out there to be kept track of, and Hayek has a lot to say about this
particular problem and the various cultural modes that have developed so
far to deal with this information-distribution problem. But it is not an
easy problem, and the fact that it is so difficult *is* one of the 
fundamental flaws of democracy which *cannot* be so easily corrected,
despite your glib assertion to the contrary.

Here are my comments:

1) I always get nervous when people use capitalized words a lot in
midsentence, as if they are trying to preach a sermon.

2) Beyond what is clearly a new form of the communism/socialism Free
Lunch meme, the idea of economic measurement by energy budgeting is only
a part solution. For a truly balanced system they would need to also
measure the mass involved, as well as the amounts of recyclable and
unrecyclable waste product.

3) It totally ignores the behavioral aspects of economics. As the fall
of communism and the widespread abandonment of much socialism has
proven, refusing to incorporate human productive motivations (whether
physical or intellectual labor) into the equation and process leads to a
downward economic death spiral.

4) What the poster is espousing is eerily like the benevolent State in
Niven's Known Space universe prior to the advent of the Kzin Wars. Read
up.

     Awful lot of pre-screening to assemble that group.  So, 100% accuracy 
     and assurance are necessary to invoke common sense legislation.  Well, 
     extroplate further, why stop evolution from impediment by ethical 
     considerations at all?  Of course, you'd have to put any humane

     aren't smart enough, willing enough or quick enough.  We could work 
     out the kinks as we go along though and save the questionably stupid 
     persons for last. <G>
     
     I would concur with your consideration that it is a character flaw on 
     your part to speak erroneously and without compassion in such an 
     absolutist fashion about free speech. It's one of my big gripes about 
     the practice of libertarianism.  Taken to its extreme, there is just 
     efficiency and no feeling.  Don't go there.    
                    
     But I do like the fact that you know your history about the cliche of 
     yelling "fire" in a crowded theater (particularly providing the 
     lifespan of Mr. Holmes, relevant in that it gave me the context of a 
     seemingly intelligent man, myopically held back by the times in which 
     he lived).  In that context (see intriguing background in next 
     paragraph), it has a poignancy that would make one want to ongoingly 
     kick themselves in the ass.  Standing on it's own, it's still a dumb 
     thing to do it and a hazard to fellow citizens who would be likely to 
     reflexively respond for the sake of survival.  And I maintain that 
     free speech is not giving a multi-billion dollar liquor industry carte 
     blanche to advertise as they please.  Sorry, but I choose to devote 
     some measure of my effort to protecting the innocent AND the stupid, 
     whether it is regarded as wasted energy or not.      
     
     Intriguing background trivia:
     
     That cliche (yelling "fire" in a crowded theater) originally came from 
     the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841-1935), he used it in 
     one of his decisions that upheld the conviction of a man imprisoned 
     for saying America should not be in the First World War. Years later 
     Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire legal 
     career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous 
     saying.
     
     
     I'm a little bit fiesty because of a nasty commute this morning so 
     pardon the peppered and sardonic nature of this response.  I believe 
     John that you are likely a very intelligent person from the few posts 
     of yours I've read.  I'll continue to note signs of compassion however 
     practically applied.

Yes, one must, when doing statistical comparisons, except groups that
warp one group more than the other. Europe has nowhere near the minority
youth gang crime problem as seen here in the US, as they have nowhere
near the same level of minority youth gangs, unless you count the
ongoing situation in the former Yugoslavia as a big gang war. Such
criminals overwhelmingly commit crimes against other criminals,
especially when it comes to violent crimes. Why? Partly because other
minority gang youths are much more accessible than any other potential
victim, partly because of the tribal rivalry dynamic involved, and also
because most gang leaders know that cops will not bother them nearly as
much when they are victimizing their fellows than when victimizing the
white middle or upper class.

Here in NH, we have a minority population of less than 1%, will little
or no gang activity, with the exception of some biker gangmembers which
are also very insular. Even though NH has a much higher number per
capita rate of gun posession (at least 10x more guns if not much more),
we have a much lower crime rate than Great Britain, more in line with
possibly Scotland, and we've never had mass murders like Dunblane.
Recreational gun use is very popular here, leading to a high rate in the
population of responsible ownership and use of guns. Boy Scouts are
taught to shoot, and there are active police explorer scout troops in
most towns. The state is also very supportive of private ownership and
use of guns. There are hunter safety courses in most towns certified by
the state, the right of self defense is supported (and our state motto
is "Live Free or Die", not an empty sentiment like most state mottos).
There is also a state law excepting gun ranges and clubs from the noise
restriction laws of the state or local ordinances.

Also, if you look at the current violent crime statistics, nationally
there was a 3% drop last year. In the 18 states that have passed
"right-to-carry" concealed weapons laws recently, violent crime rates
have dropped 8% in the same period, leading one to conclude that at
least 80% of that 3% drop nationally occured in just those states with
more liberalized concealed weapons laws, while the rest of the country
changed little. So much for the success of the FBI or Clintons "crime"
Bill.

As for the tort issue, I think that any criminal that expresses remorse,
is not considered a danger to others, and agrees to and participates in
programs to help solve their own root dysfunctions that led to the
crime, should be able to work on restitution, even under only house
arrest (electronic monitoring), since one can typically make more money
on the outside than stamping license plates in prison.

However, although I support the legalization/medicalization of drug use,
until it is legalized, I am rather hesitant to be so lenient with drug
related criminals, mostly due to the social problems that encouraging
freedom for drug pushers will exacerbate, and given that anyone
convicted of drug dealing, especially if they are a minority, has a
snowballs chance in hell of getting a legal job to pay restitution with,
giving them in home "detention" is merely encouraging their presently
illegal behavior, and that which their customers commit to get money for
their habits.

In the end we all know that solving our high crime rate nationally will
require 1)the legalization, taxation, and regulation of drug use, and 2)
the legal recognition of the right of all  majority age individuals to
carry deadly force for purposes of self defense of themselves and their
children/charges.

I get worried when someone tells me of a magic scheme to solve all of 
our problems, that involves the citizenry rising up, and imposing it
on everyone.

It sounds to me like someone took an ecology course, and was struck
by how ecosystems have energy economies. They then proceeded to 
rename a number of existing economic structures, and refer to them
in CAPITAL LETTERS.
To some approximation, money is already a shorthand in the economy
for energy transfers (to the point that you can model it that way),
and can be tracked the way that an energy budget is used in 
ecology. It gives a nice viewpoint of looking at it, and maybe 
some insight. 
Unfortunately this bunch seems to have missed that nature is the 
ultimate market economy (if income goes below expenses for an extended
period of time, the animal or plant goes out of business (dies and or goes
extinct)).
It sounds like they think this form of accounting will automatically make
some change in the system. However, nature is way ahead of them. Natural
systems accomodate parasitism (read: taxation), overgrazing (deficit spending),
symbiosis (sweetheart regulatory deals) etc. 
The problem is not the accounting system, but rather the system itself,
and they seem kinda vague about how they will change it, and how they 
will mandate those changes.

Specifics follow.

Why is it that the purveyors of "magic bullet" solutions seem to think 
everyone should already know them? This is a tip off that we're dealing 
with faith rather than reason.

The capital letters seem to be either out of a marketing department, or a 
Zippy the Pinhead quote generator. Neither bode well for the rest of 
the piece.

No specifics, but the implication of some sort of system to mandate that 
everyone got what someone else deemed was plenty.
The "geographic area" sounds suspiciously like a centrally planned 
economy for various regions. The past few decades have shown that to
be pretty much bankrupt (USSR, N. Korea, etc.)

Well, I can't argue too much with that. But that's partly because the 
last sentence is confusingly worded.
I keep wondering about the reference to KWTS (I assume they mean
kilowatts) almost as if it were a religious invocation.

Again this begs the question of who is going to do the calculating of 
who gets what.
It does use the time honored method of raising a specter that can then
be villified (The Summit of Eight), and hopefully keep you from noticing
that what they consider the real enemy is the "PRICE/PROFIT SYSTEM", 
i.e. free market economics.

Not only an appeal to credentials, but anonymous ones at that.
Sorry, but I stopped buying pigs in pokes some time ago.

Not many Americans understand what Scientology is about either, despite
several decades of moderately successful marketing.
And note how Technocracy is capitalized so it refers to something 
completely different than the usual meaning of technocracy.

This is what in science is called the too many miracles problem.
Just implement our magic system (which we don't rigidly define), and 
all the problems will go away.

I certainly see the quantitative changes it wrought, and in some cases 
even qualitative changes, but I don't immediately see how they negate
the utility of a market economy. Again, no reasoning behind it is given.

You could measure it in Quatloos, or whatever unit you want, but there
will still be a mapping from one measurement system to another. The
basic math doesn't change. 
It would take some work to account for all the input and outgo of a 
household in terms of energy used, but I'm not even sure it would have much 
real utility, outside of making decisions about environmental impact. 
Unlike a price system, it's cumbersome in its dealing with scarcity or
overabundance.

Simple obfuscation to draw attention to dissatisfaction with an aspect

Ah, so I am to understand that government and banking policy has zero to
do with the outcomes of the economy?
It's not a direct cause and effect relation, but each has some effect on the 
other. To say that it has none, is just a way of trying to sell that since
the current system is irrelevant you won't lose anything by trying ours.
I'll give them that the current system may in some ways be undesireable, but 
hardly irrelevant.

Another message that says the system is about to collapse or go thru a

Attempt to lay on a guilt trip if you support a free market system.
Also note the use of the acronym. Likely there is some defined 
definition of M.O.N.E.Y (tm) that is different from what is the
usual meaning of money, and the economic system it circulates in.
I'm reminded of the early 70s when one commercial jingle was:
"We've changed our name to Exxon, but it's still the same old gas"

Gads, the hubris. No allowance that there might be a better way than their
magic formula, but only a possibility of more effectively implementing
what they have already dictated (and not bothered to really define).
Sounds like the usual true believer viewpoint.

> 
> Where do you fit into all this?  JQS

An implication that if you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the 
problem. i.e. Why aren't you out there shouting our magic system from the 
rooftops, because any fool can see it's the best.


Well, sounds like the usual dreck from those who would impose a bankrupt
centrally planned economy for supposed environmental reasons. Their program
could have some worthwhile aspects to it, but it's impossible to tell from 
this. It's all sales, and no real info.
On the whole: No thanks.

When I say it is "the information processed that counts" I don't mean
its quantity but its quality. That's the difference.

Communicating with others is not actually necessary in the sense that
THEY have to hear YOU. It's enough if you listen.

Posthuman entities, if there are several ones and no collective (whereas
I consider the latter possibility as more likely) will need to talk to
each other to get results. But they will not demand money for them,
because whenever they give knowledge, they don't lose it.

When I give you an apple, I don't have the apple anymore. But when I
tell you about the principles of quantum mechanics (for instance) I
don't lose anything but I can only win (from a universal viewpoint: the
more people know about it, the more probable it is that new discoveries
will be made soon). That's why trade in the sense of "give and take"
loses its value.

It's not just rhetorics. When I want to achieve power, I usually measure
my goal with what I know _now_. For example, "I want to rule the world".
And when I want to achieve power I usually don't want to possess it, but
to USE it -- against other people, other entities or whatever. This
seems entirely unlikely to me for a posthuman behaviour, for it destroys
valuable information sources.

When I want to achieve knowledge, I want to know things I don't already
know. I want to find NEW things. And I want to possess knowledge, not
for the use against others, just for the possession in itself.

Such a sanctimonious fellow! I don't suppose you've ever played a violent
video game (which was the subject under discussion, not any actual acts
of violence, though admitted some slow people might not be able to tell
the difference) or watched and enjoyed a violent movie? Raised in a 
Buddhist monastery perhaps?

I should have refrained from replying, because all I'm doing is pointing
out that your post is free of content, which is the one sin worse than
initiating a content-free post, but I'm not afraid to sin occasionally.

Very convenient to hinge everything on differences you cannot
define.

I wasn't using the word "communication" in such a one-sided sense.
I intended the word to cover both receptive and transmittive
communication. Something you might have picked up on if you had
your receivers pumped up as high as your transmitters are.

This would be very nice if it were possible to carry out computation
without any energy and without any physical substrate. Unfortunately,
it is not, so information is not the *only* scarce resource. I do
understand that pretending it is simplifies your worldview vastly,
but I try to keep my weltanschauung as simple as possible, and no
simpler.

When you give me an apple and I give you an orange, and this happens
voluntarily, then you have an orange (which you prefer to an apple)
and I have an apple (which I prefer to an orange).  We both benefit,
positive sum game, and furthermore because our act (a transaction)
has infinitesimally affected the market price of apples and oranges,
we have anonymously transmitted some information to the world about
our relative preferences for apples and oranges. There's an
information-communication feat very difficult to pull off reliably
in an engineered system.

As for the rest, it sounds like an argument against institutions
of intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, and trademarks,
and I've already expressed my doubts about such restrictions on
information exchange in this forum previously. I can't think of
any good way to refute Lee Daniel Crocker's arguments on this point.
Right now, I think it's a bit theoretical, since gummints are still
running around shooting, bombing, and kidnapping people for even
more obviously innocent actions than giving someone a "free" copy
of some Microsoft product.

You claim that you have no interest whatsoever in making any use
of knowledge?

Don't you want to use your knowledge to help all the poor and
suffering people on this planet?

I hope that the above two questions have made it clear that you
have yet to adequately explain the difference between knowledge
and power, and that you have yet to adequately defend yourself
from the charge of using empty rhetoric. If you expect me to
believe that you do not seek to ever use any of the knowledge
you obtain (for instance, you will not use your knowledge in
order to obtain more knowledge), I'll hope you'll pardon me in
saying that I'm just not that gullible.

What you want is power to help the poor and suffering: stop
pretending otherwise. You mean to rule wisely and well, but you
mean to rule.

My question concerns what we are really advocating here. I see only an
ounce of anarchism in all of it. Where there exists a law, there must
exist coercion, otherwise what is its point? And where there exists
coercion, there exists something doing the coercing. Whether or not it's
a person or a piece of paper, it's government pure and simple. The
profit-motive basis is extremely interesting to me, but
democro-capitalism seems to me just as worthwhile. 

Why not just make an all encompassing contract (say, a Constitution)
which one may choose to sign or not. We can name an arbitrator (say, a
Supreme Court) which will interpret the terms of the contract. Anyone
who signs the contract (we can call them "citizens") are also allowed to
live in a certain geographical area (let's call this the U.S.) which is
protected by a large PPA (say, an Army). Those who have signed the
contract and then breach (let's call these guys "criminals") are
correspondingly punished according to the terms of the contract they
have signed (let's call this "expatriation"). Correspondingly, lets also
make an even bigger contract (called the United Nations) to make sure
the U.S. doesn't just decide to enslave the world. Or even better, let's
make a worldwide contract (called Gaia)...

Et cetera.

What is anarchy? Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of
government. Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as
an individual person. There is no world government to speak of, no
international law, merely treaties between nations. War has always
happened, even in the presence of treaties. A treaty (or contract) is
often a sly way of throwing the other party off. The history of
international relations until WWI is a study in anarchy. Accordingly,
the history of humanity is the history of war between nations in an
anarchic system. Regardless, can we make it work? 

While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people
contracting singly with all others in order to protect themselves, how
can this be desirable? You can't make a contract with every single
person you come into contact with. And if every possible term of the
contract is open to debate (such as whether I may kill you for XYZ
reasons; or if your first-born son will be interest for a three million
monetary unit loan) then people will be required to spend all their time
making contracts. IMO, this is ridiculous. The only real option is a
contract among groups of people. So we're back again to a government.

Contracts is a sticky business. Without an established law of contracts,
this idea won't even work. Offer, acceptance, consideration? That's only
the beginning. What happens when the named arbitrator dies? Or is killed
by my hired thugs? What happens if I forge your signature on a contract
and you forge my name on another? What about a contract of adhesion?
What about unequal bargaining power? What about fraud, duress, or
unconscionability? 

Et cetera.

It is no solution to pretend that we can include all permutations of
eventualities in a blanket term of the contract. It is similarly inane
to attempt to treat each specifically. There must some things that are
just "understood" as common to all and decent for all. 

I sense that what is really desired here is actually a very *LIMITED*
meta-contract for everyone. This would cover the bare essentials (let's
call these life, liberty, and property) and leave everything else open
for debate. But then again, this is not anarachy. So I must be wrong. 

IMO, the only certainty in a world where every human relationship is
codified, signed in triplicate, registered, notarized, and vaulted is
total war.

Ugh. This is Mutually Assured Destruction all over again. This is saying
that total war would not occur, indeed violence would occur with less
frequency. I am quite optomistic about humanity, but this is too much
for even me to say. Again I point to the only example I can of true
anarchy -- the world at any point before WWI. War between nations is our
history.

Furthermore, to me, the preceding quotation suggests that the
profit-motive is the final arbiter. In this situation, what does one
measure one's profit in? Not dollars or francs or rubles, because a
currency would require a large group contract which would "govern" its
value. What happens when a party declares his rubles to be worth more
than the contract stipulates? Send a PPA after him? This is coercion;
this is government; this is not anarchy.

So then a weapons race among PPA's? Small tactical nukes built from the
Anarchist's Cookbook? I foresee a very convoluted, and profitable
weapons industry -- not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable
resources which might be used for more transhuman pursuits.

But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four years
that the next idiot can't undo in four years. So eventually the 49%
become 51% and kill the other 49%. We don't really get anywhere, but we
sure as hell bounce back and forth like mad. I like this system because
it keeps the idiots occupied, leaving us free to go about our business
of ascension.

So I should spend everything I have to avoid being killed? How is this

 Dear Mark and fellow Extropians,

Apparently, at least one member of this select circle has not upgraded to a
browser that can read HTML. In an attempt to please a possible minority of
one (at least until he upgrades) I'll write in plain script.

Apparently there has been a misunderstanding about my aversion to a
dialogue about any form of death that involves members of our species
eliminating another for whatever reason -- or rationale -- might be put
forth. 

My aversion to argumentums academica et philisophica where it involves
killing is, as you might imagine, quite personal. It probably comes from
more than a few intimate experiences in which I was directly involved in
various forms of death several  means.  

To be as direct as possible, I find discussions of this sort repugnant. I
suspect that rather being concerned with improving the human condition by
education and other means, his is little more than an exercise in
sublimating ones own hostilities or sexual drives by intellectualizing
them.

Kindly alow this dialogue to end here.

Thank you,

A.M. Genen

Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,

Full participation should mean more than being fully informed.
It should mean being fully educated in reasoning and developing the
understanding required to make careful, critical, value judgements based on
highly developed knowledge, skills and abilities.

Ultimately, dear Hagbard, we should all be part of the ruling class.

The discussion itself is not repugnant at all. It is death that is
repugnant. 

Also, what on earth do you mean by the latter part of the above paragraph?

I started reading "Atlas Shrugged" a few weeks ago, and just couldn't
bring myself to finish it. It is so badly written that I am not going to waste
 any more time on.

The concepts that Rand tries so heroically to convey in her novel should
have been left to her mentor, Nietzsche.

Not at all, governments have about a 2% accuracy rate, but that doesn't  
prevent them from having all sorts of nifty common sense legislation. It's 
common sense that the Earth is the center of the Universe and those who say 
otherwise should be burned alive. It's common sense that black people are 
sub human and thus ethical to enslave. It's common sense that Jews are evil 
and so should be exterminated. It's common sense that government should 
monitor and control what we say to each other on the Internet, it's for our 
own good, we're too dumb to do it ourselves and your typical government 
bureaucrat is far more intelligent than either one of us.

I have absolutely no objection to that, I might even help you, provided it's 
voluntary. My objection is when people insist of saving me from myself, 
whether I want to be saved or not. I don't think I'm significantly stupider 
than the average person and I don't want to be protected, if I'm wrong about 
my mental capacity I'm willing to accept the consequences.

Actually I'm a very nice fellow, my dog thinks I'm wonderful and it's been 
months since I evicted and widows and forced their pre school children to 
work in my rendering plant. My employees like me also, they tell me that all 
the time, good thing too, otherwise I'd fire their ass so fast it'd make your 
head spin. But then, why wouldn't they like me, hell, I let them take half
a day off every other Christmas.

Interesting, I read these books at about 14 and I don't even remember
the term Libertarian.  I had forgotten all about the cryonics story
until you mentioned it.  I do remember lots of weird stuff and it all
got lumped in together.  I also read Prolongevity at about the same time.
I already wanted to live forever but I had not yet shaken off lots of
religious beliefs so pyramid power was about as appealing as cryonics.

I would love to hear the history of how various people on the list came
to hold some of their extropic ideas.

Two, and it isn't entirely a question of "upgrading".  Even when the
mailer I use on this cluster knows enough to recognize a MIME message
there's generally no point.  Often I'm on a terminal, in which case I
can't see anything special.  Sometimes I'm on an X console; then I'm
asked permission to go into MIME mode.  If I say yes it spawns another
xterm and displays the message in a small font.  Oh boy, the advance of
technology.  Using bold or italics isn't exactly worth the effort.  And
then I might want to save the text...

Not that I'd call mush (ancestor of Zmail, I hear) a "browser".  Runs a
lot faster, for one thing.

This is a mailing list.  Use e-mail and e-mail programs.  HTML is nice,
but more expensive.  Specifically running graphics programs is expensive
in time and memory.  I prefer not to enter that realm unless there's
reason to do so.  I will ignore people whose messages take more effort
to read than they are worth.

Or a real writer like Heinlein.  "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" gets the
ideas across, and is a real page-turner.

As a twelve year Internet veteran, let me first correct your terminology:
all "browsers" read HTML; that's their job.  Some of them also read mail,
which isn't their job, but many people think it is.  Email has been
around for a lot longer than the web has, and has developed its own
standards over time to allow interchange between the millions of
systems supporting it, hundreds of thousands of which have never even
heard of HTML.  Email programs support lots of features that have
developed over those years to make email more powerful and useful.
Many browsers fail to support many of those features, and instead like
to make up their own standards outside of the Internet community so
they can brag about "features" that have already been available in
standardized forms.

HTML is not and has never been a valid format for email.  It has
never been endorsed by any standards organization, it is not supported
by most serious email programs, and is a serious waste of bandwidth
and nuisance to those of us who use real email programs.  The MIME
format "text/enriched" /is/ a valid format, and less intrusive, and
understood by real email programs (but not, alas, by the idiots who
write Netscape mail and MS Exchange, so it should still be avoided).

All communication requires standards.  Without them, one would have
to tailor every communication to its specific audience, which is the
impossible state of affairs the standards were created to avoid.
Where the standards fail, expanding them is justified.  But where they
work well, and have worked well for years, flagrantly violating them
is pointless and rude.

P.S. Thanks for the opportunity to expand ny Web page's rant about
standards.  The email nonsense hadn't occurred to me at the time. :)

Politicians must be judged by their actions, not their words.  Actual
results rather than expressed motives.  Considering Clinton's real
action of signing the CDA, then pursuing its appeal to the Supreme
Court, his statement of opposition to censorship doesn't make him a
free-speech supporter, it just makes him a liar.

No need to wonder, just go look up their actual words.  Yes, they did
indeed imagine just that; large multi-national trading companies and
advertising existed then just as they do now, and Jefferson himself
said that he preferred the advertisements in a newpaper to the editorials
because they contained more truth.

Becoming wealthy does not cause one to lose human rights.  Advertising
is free expression, and always has been, even of the court has only
recently started to recognize that plain fact (the Coors case, etc.)

It is an insult to the human mind to suggest that it is not capable
of judging for itself the value of information it receives, and a
exercise of boundless blind faith to suggest that any government is
more capable of such judgment than anyone with >80 IQ.  I, for one,
am capable of judging for myself, and I refuse to concede my right
to do so to any government.  Caveat Lector.

Sayeth Miss Rand after reading Nietzche's "The Birth of Tragedy:
He is "statedly anti-reason.  He said that reason is an inferior faculty,
that drunken-orgy emotions were supereior.  That finished him as a
spiritual ally."  (from the biography by Barbara Branden,  "The Passion of
Ayn Rand" 

I found "Atlas Shrugged" to be very ingaging, and have taken many valuable
lessons from her philosophy, as well as some that are best unlearned.  I
haven't read any Nietzche, but would like to-- I dig drunken-orgies.  ;->

Exovivo!

Interesting how you placed my handle in quotes. A subtle dig -- or not
so?

Ignorance, indeed. 

Privacy, Anton, is a thing of the past. 

Without splitting hairs, to cling to the idea that what we do is in any
way private, or even should be, is IMO worthless. Technology will see to
that. When the first hot-air ballooner lifted himself over a wall and
saw what the neighbors were really doing, what did the neighbors scream?
Probably something to do with privacy. So then we should've scrapped the
idea of flight? I can't wait until someone figures out a way to read a
person's mind. What will be the first thing the Philistines will scream?
It will probably have something to do with privacy.

I hope I don't sound like I'm flaming, but I must admit, my guard is up.

Nonetheless, my identity does not depend upon what people know about me.

Anyway, about the issue of democracy. Can we agree that if everyone is
well-informed, the problems which Mark suggested dissipate?

        I frequently hear complaints about Rand's apparent "inability" as a
novelist and I can never understand quite why.  I can honestly say that I
find "Atlas Shrugged" to be the best book that I have ever read (though "The
Illuminatus! Trilogy," "Stranger in a Strange Land" and "Neverness" are
quite close as well).  What exactly is it that people dislike about her
writing style?  To me, the obvious passion she puts into the plot and
character details is beautiful and very genuine --alright, I'll agree that
there is a definate dichotomy between the "good guys" and the "bad guys,"
but I think that that is only indicative of the strength of her philosophy.
"TMIAHM" *is* a great book as well, but it is certainly focused a lot
differently than "Atlas Shrugged."

        A suggestion for anyone who is either repulsed or intimidated by
"Atlas Shrugged" is to read "Anthem."  As well as being told beautifully
(IMO of course) it is a tenth of the size of "Atlas Shrugged."  Probably
some of the nicest words ever written (again, IMO) are in the book.

        "I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them.  The fortune
of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to
the winds as alms for the pure of spirit.  I guard my treasures: my
thought, my will, my freedom.  And the greatest of these is
freedom."  (p. 95-96)

        I don't know about others, but such words to me are the epitomy of
beauty: the greatness of man's potential summed up in one hundred pages.
It's worth a read.

Hi.

How does cryonics preserve the information in the brain?

It appears to me that given the amount of time required to get the body to
an appreciably low temperature, it would allow the chemical/ionic
potentials in the brain to approach something resembling equilibrium.
Since the brain structure is merely the hardware, wouldn't a brain in
equilibrium essentially be a blank slate?  Cryonics sounds more like a
reboot of your brain rather than the popular long sleep scenario.  At the
very least, it seems that you should suffer significant loss of pre-cryo
memory.  Quick-freezing the brain (minutes, or maybe an hour or two) would
probably prevent this, but the current state of cryonics is many, many
hours to get to liquid Nitrogen temperatures.

Also, on a more technical side, is liquid Nitrogen capable of stopping
ion/molecular transport, or just slowing it down?  If there was small but
finite transport activity, it would put a "shelf-life" on information
stored in a cryo-brain.

The neurophysiology inclined on this list may be able to answer this.

It still came across as HTML.


He's not the only one.  Contrary to popular opinion, there are still a
significant number of people who access their mail and news from Unix
terminals, shell accounts, and other related character-based modes.  I
travel frequently; I prefer to Telnet into a server and read my mail
remotely than to download it to someone elses machine, or via someone
else's account.  I would also like to add that HTML is (as you noted) a
*browser* standard, which has little or nothing to do with email.  Email
has been around for a very long time and implements universally recognized
standards that predate the Web by many years.  HTML is merely eye candy,
adding little or no value to text-based forum of size limited messages.  It
might also be noted that mail "enhancement" standards already exist
(although I don't think the Microsoft cartel supports them).

BEGIN RANT

The e-mail/news experience would be far better if people spent less time
choosing fonts and more time contemplating the content of their messages.
The sad level of discourse on most Internet newsgroups is a window into the
soul of human race.  Things I have learned on Usenet:  People prefer
fantasy to reality.  Most people have immutable and narrow world views.
There is no bliss greater than ignorance. Fact is a purely subjective term.
 Fundamental rules of evidence and logic are arbitrary and can be redefined
at will.  Ad nauseum...

Of the 10s of millions of people on the Internet, I would be willing to
state that less than 10,000 add value of any type (e.g. "This webpage is
about my dog, Spot" or "you (suck|are stupid|are unqualified) because you
are critically analyzing my scientifically impossible and logically absurd
hypothesis").  I had a friend a long time ago who once stated that "9 out
of 10 people are functional idiots" and liked to refer to people as "chimps
in pants".  I would like to disagree, but there is an apparent validity to
his comments.  There is a non-trivial segment of the population which
appears to have unsalvageable minds.  

I don't normally mix or interact with "normal" minded people.  By nature I
tend to associate with people, who if not very similar in mind, are at
least intelligent and open-minded.  Many years back, I joined the Army and
was promptly stuck in South Carolina for many months.  The "up close and
personal" exposure to the type of people I met and worked with in South
Carolina was a major culture shock for me.  A lot of the people I met there
were not only aware of their ignorance and profoundly irrational world
views, they *enjoyed* it.  Their beliefs in modern social and cultural
myths could not be swayed by the most irrefutable evidence.  And some of
the myths were incredible, both in their magnitude and absurdity.  Where
does one start?    

The one thing I like most about the extropian list is the amount of
rational thought that goes into the content.  I appreciate the fact that
most of the people on this list are clear-thinking, open-minded
individuals.  Even if I disagree with someone's opinion, I enjoy the
exposure to a well thought out paragraph that supports the opposing opinion
in a constructive manner.  I have even changed one or two closely held
viewpoints based on posts made to this list.  In my experience this is
outside the capabilities of the majority of people.

As much as I would like to "help" everyone else, I am increasingly coming
to the conclusion that most individuals have devised their own demise, and
should suffer by it.  In the long run, everyone is responsible for their
own destiny.  


Is it possible that at the current pace of technology and human
development, the gene pool is simply incapable of purging itself in a
timely manner?  Or maybe it is the meme pool?  The only pervasive new memes
seem to be somewhat non-significant and superficial in comparison to the
core "bad" memes we are so concerned about.

Geez, it's a game, not real life (and the deaths-per-second ratio doesn't
come close to Doom or Quake, particularly as the opposing pilots normally
manage to eject). I'm not advocating that people go out and blow up the
IRS, I just thought it was amusing that in these flag-waving
government-is-god days someone had released a game where the correct
response to the threat of an IRS audit was to go to war against them.

A society without coercion is impossible, I would never be so foolish as to

That would be fine, the trouble is I never signed it and have no desire to do 
so, yet they say I am bound by it and I am.  I don't have a death wish and 
the government has much bigger guns that I do so when they say give me your

PPA's are not euphemisms for states because PPA's do not claim powers that 
individuals do not have. There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do something 
you want, love, trade, or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep 
force to a minimum. Everybody agrees that force is justified in self defense 
but government claims far more rights than that, more than any sane individual 
or corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I 
object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their booty, 
as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. 
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. If government needs labor to fight a
war or be on a jury they feel justified in enslaving me until the task is 
accomplished. They'll make me an offer I can't refuse because I know that if 
I do armed men will come to my house and drag me away. I don't think 
government should not have more rights than individuals, but then of course, 
it wouldn't be a government.                                      


        >are also allowed to live in a certain geographical area 


You can join a PPA and live in any geographical area you want.
            

        >Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of government. 


Exactly, it is not the absence of law.


        >Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as an

Treat horse manure as ice cream and you could have strawberries and ice cream, 
if you had some strawberries.

If there were no nations there would be no war between nations.

Don't be foolish, nobody is saying make a separate contract with everybody on  
earth, you just sign up with a PPA of your choice. The PPA makes contracts 
with other PPA's about what laws to follow and how arbitration is to be  
handled. You won't have total freedom of choice about what laws you want to  
live by and who you want to judge you, but you'd have a lot more choice than
you have now.

            
        >What about fraud, duress, or unconscionability? 
            

Yes, those are problems unique to Anarchy, fraud and duress and 
unconscionability are impossible today.

Obviously. If it was possible for law  to be completely spelled out like a

but it isn't so there is.

"Money" is just something that is easy to transport, fungible, and a large 
number of people think is valuable. Exactly the same thing would be true in a 
world of Anarchy, except you would not be forced to use only the currency of 
the nation you were living in. If somebody tried to tax you by inflation, 
a great favorite among politicians today, you could just switch to a currency
that was more stable.

        >I foresee a very convoluted, and profitable weapons industry                
        

I don't know what you mean by "convoluted" but yes, I expect it would be about 
as profitable as the industry is now.        


        >not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable resources which

It's true, a world without crime or war where everyone lived together in 
peace love and happiness would be better than anything I described, so would 
a world where the tooth fairy was real.

It takes far less than 4 years to kill you dead as a door nail. Only about 25 
years ago the U.S. republic forced millions of its citizens to leave their 
home and fight and often die in a idiotic war 12 thousand miles away that 
they didn't believe in.

If you are successfull in repealing the 9th and 10th amendments, let me
know. Of course, first you'll have to repeal the second amendment to
keep me from coming after you with my assault rifle when you do.

This would be a great technology to expand privacy by getting the courts
to recognize such memory escrow as private and inviolate. Use by law
enforcement would be tantamount to self incrimination, i.e. not allowed.

I also read Atlas Shrugged about five years ago while spending a weekend
holed up at a freinds San Juan Island estate. I found that as long as I
skipped the 20 page soliloquiys in the middle of the book, it was rather
a decent, if dark, read. Given the time in which it was written, one can
see the sense of urgent intensity on the part of the writer to warn
against the tidal wave of "peoples democratic republics" taking root
across the planet, and the burgeoning socialistic hold on domestic
politics.

Why is it that corporations are given rights that only reside in
individual citizens? A corporation is not a person, not a citizen, ergo,
it has no rights. One could say that the individuals who work at or own
the corporation have rights of free speech, yet those individuals are
not liable for the corporations actions, so they as individuals cannot
be sued for libel, slander, and other illegal use of free speech.

I know of no evidence that the stars we see are _not_ inside Dyson
spheres.  Let's say we put an opaque sphere around a star.  The star
is radiating away a certain energy per unit time, and your sphere
has to deal with that power.  I suppose you could reflect that energy
back toward the star, but soon you'd end up with a tremendous energy
density inside the sphere.  A good designer would probably try to
balance radiation and gas pressure with gravitational stress on the
sphere (the exact ratio depending on how hot they like it), but once
they reach an equilibrium they'd let all the incoming energy out.
Remember that energy can't reduce entropy, you need a _flux_ of
energy, a thermodynamic engine.  Therefore, a well-designed Dyson
sphere would look just like a star from here.  A paranoid designer
might even go to some length to ensure that the spectrum of the
outgoing radiation looks "natural" to a casual observer.

In fact, I can hardly see how else can a Dyson sphere be built.
One would start from seeds that would "sail" near the star and
expand themselves in such a way that the gravitational stress at
any point during the construction is kept at an absolute minimum.
Even the finished sphere is gravitationally unstable, it needs
some sort of distributed propulsion mechanism or lots of
controllable openings to keep the star in the middle and to
dampen oscillations.  It's a two-dimensional bridge without
endpoints of pylons---the mother of all engineering nightmares!

  A paranoid designer might indeed fake the appearance of a star, but
a straightforward approach results in the star's energy being
re-emitted from a solid surface (possibly one in many small pieces)
whose total area is vastly larger than that of the star.  Thus the
energy flux emitted per unit area is much smaller than for the star,
the temperature of the emitter is vastly lower, and the spectrum is
substantially different.  Thus a Dyson sphere whose diameter was 100
times its star's, would have surface area 10000 times its star's, and
temperature (via the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law) ten times less.

  Those stars for which we have been able to measure diameters
(either directly, with interferometers, or indirectly, by watching
eclipsing binaries or measuring spectral broadening and rotational
period, or by other means), have diameters in essence consistent
with just plain stars.

  Furthermore, unless the energy is ultimately radiated at a lower
temperature than that of the original emitter, one cannot get much
useful work out of it as it goes by.

  Of course, a Dyson-sphere designer might have designed a small
sphere, and have raised the temperature of the star inside it enough
to allow extraction of lots of work from the energy on the way out, or
merely faked a slightly cooler star than was actually present.  But I
think present-day astronomy pretty well rules out the hypothesis that
a substantial fraction of stars are surrounded by large, "unstealthed"
Dyson spheres of the kind Dyson originally discussed (which more
nearly resembled dense swarms of asteroids than solid spheres, I
recall...).  And if there are lots of spheres that are stealthed, I am
not sure I want to know what they are hiding from.

I just picked up the May 19th issue of TIME from the coffee table and
read Prof. David Gelernter's column claiming that computers never will
be truly as smart as humans. THis is the same issue the Kasparov match
was covered in. Gelernter claims to be a prof of computer science at
Yale fer gawd sakes, yet he expresses ideas that are in total ignorance
of Moore's Law, as well as breakthroughs of the past year in human/chip
interfaces, etc. It got me so ticked off I actually got off my horse and
wrote a rather long letter, possibly enough to be a column in and of
itself, where I poke the holes in his arguments. I'm attaching it here
for you guys and gals to make comments on.

How Hard is Human?
by Michael S. Lorrey

David Gelernter may be a professor of computer science at Yale, but any informed individual can see that he is not only misinfomed about his own field, but hopelessly behind the times with respect to our knowledge of neurophysiology if his column in the May 19th issue is any indication of his knowledge of progress in artificial intelligence and brain/machine interface. One hopes that a tenured member of the Yale faculty was merely presenting those facts which bolstered his defensive position that computers will never be as smart as human beings, rather than demonstrating his obsolescence.

Any computer professional has heard of Moore's Law, first formulated by one of the founder's of Intel back in 1969. Moore's Law, based on data up to that date and proven to still be true today, states that the processing power of a given dollar value of computer chips will double every 18 months, and that the price of any given chip will drop by half every 18 months. This is the sort of technological progress that has the inflation and productivity estimators at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in apopleptic fits. If such drastic deflation were actually accounted for in our government economic figures, cost of living adjustments for seniors, bond rates, and the deficit would crash into the negative in just a few years. Where this applies to artificial intelligence is in the long term. If you apply Moore's law into the future, you will find that sometime between 2025 and 2035, the average desktop computer will have as much processing power as the human brain, which has somewhere !
!
around 10^17 and 10^19 neuron connections. 

Gelernter is right in saying it is silly to ascribe intelligence to Deep Blue, as that computer has as much processing power as say, a housefly or a maybe even a mouse. No one has ever assigned much intelligence to creatures of that level (PETA excluded). However, to say that no computer will ever be truly intelligent, will ever truly think is hubris of the highest order. While he has the right to claim some supernatural source of our being, so far he cannot prove that the human mind is nothing more than a biochemical computer with a neural net architecture. Given this, we can duplicate that architecture in other forms, even silicon.

Going on to his further errors, he paraphrases Wordsworth and Coleridge, in that human thought is largely a process of stringing memories together, and that memories are often linked by emotion. Associative thinking is, in fact, largely how we think most of the time, but this can be duplicated by any relational database. Anyone on the internet who uses the more advanced search engines knows that they are getting smarter and smarter every day. They are capable of learning from past experience, capable of making suggestions for other search areas associated by their experience with the parameters the user is searching with. 

The claim that thinking is dictated by emotion is utterly false. At best our thinking is muddied or even given greater color by our emotions. Studies have shown that heightened emotions tend to give greater reinforcement to certain memories, especially experiences heavily laden with adrenaline, but this behavior can also be easily accounted for in programming if needed. Criminal Science studies of crime scene witnesses have also shown that these "reinforced" memories tend to also be very inaccurate, leading to dubious conclusions of the usefulness of emotion in thinking accurately.

He goes on, in the end, to state that even if computers are ever capable of "simulating human thought", they will never be fully human. "The gap between human and surrogate is permanent and will never be closed." This is also false. There have been in the last year, breakthroughs in electronic interfaces between computer chips and human neurons. At the very least these will restore sight and hearing to millions of people around the world, probably they will also allow millions of paralysed individuals to move again. Eventually, this will lead to the ability of human beings to plug a network cable into their heads to directly interface with other people and computers all over the world. At this point, if even the most perceptive individual cannot tell the difference between the thoughts of another human on the net and an intelligent computer, will the gap be closed? Probably not, but this is the point that will trigger great debate in our society between progressives and reacti!
!
onaries. Charges of racism and heresy will fly. Children and less sophisticated adults will call each other "chip-lover" and "bio-bigot".

What will close the gap will be when a human being successfully transfers their software template to a computer. Will this new mind have a soul? Will it matter? And what about those who will be in between, much as bisexuals are caught in the middle of todays pro- and anti-gay activists. With bio/chip interfaces, there will be a large part of the population who will eventually, with the augmentation of additional artificially made processors and interfaces, become more than just human, but not machines either. To remove the augmentations will hobble these personalities as much as a lobotomy would do so to you or I. These transhumans will lead the way into this future whether neo-Luddites like Gelernter like it or not.

I'm reading it at the moment, for the 3rd time.  The problem with Rand
is that she thinks art is propaganda (see "The Romantic Manifesto"). 
But when she's just writing 'realistically', to convey her philosophical
ideas by observation of 'the minute particularity of things' by giving a
sense of time and place, rather than using her characters as ventriloquist's
dummies, she's actually quite good, and the bits of plain description in
her writing are the best bits of her writing qua writing.

Rand is a million miles away from Nietzsche.  She has very little sense
of irony, whereas that's one of Nietzsche's major features.  I believe
that she thought he was an irrationalist.  There are only superficial
similarities.

Isn't the main reason why corporations are treated as persons in the law
so that they can be held responsible for their actions?  i.e. the people
who form the corporation are held collectively responsible for anything
'it' does?

Perhaps they have a more evolved aesthetic sense than you. Perhaps they
value the diversity of variously independently evolve intelligences more
than some eventual cosmic dissolution. Given that the stars in our sky
have been probably the most inspirational thing in history, taking that
sight away from millions of possible intelligent races is in my opinion
a huge crime, not only that, but those races caught on a planet inside a
dyson sphere would eventually be baked to death, so not only does this
mean the death of inspiration, but the death of innumerable
intelligences. Perhaps they know of a way out of this universe for
advanced races to follow to avoid the end of this one. Perhaps they
value the pace of evolution races will take from matter based to energy
based organisms. There are many possible answers to Fermi's Paradox that
still leave open the possibility for other intelligent species.

Givne that we as a race are nowhere near as rapaciously expansive as we
once were, I would expect that by the time we are expanding out into the
universe in large numbers, we will have achieved a rather Buddha-like
peacefulness and respect for potential.

I hope Mark's comments will make it little clearer to Mr. Celine
why his remark to Anton aroused such vitriol from some of the
other list members.

Mr. Celine's namesake, a fictional character in a famous novel,
once observed "Without private property, there can be no private
life." Mr. Celine might also want to keep in mind that without
privacy, there can be no private property.

Erik Moeller, for instance, might be happy to do away with all
private life, once and for all, and condemn all human beings to
permanently live the life of a politician, but I suspect many here
would struggle to escape from such a fate. I know I would.

Mr. Celine, you've read your Wilson, but have you read your

Somebody mentioned that bit about yelling fire in a crowded theater, I said:
    
 That cliche originally came from the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes 
 (1841-1935), he used it in one of his decisions that upheld the conviction  
 of a man imprisoned for saying America should not be in the First World War. 
 Years later Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire 
 legal career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous 
 saying.
  
Several have written me asking for a source.  The decision was called  
"Schenck vs United States" and came out in 1919, you can read about it on 
page 942 of "The Oxford Companion To The Supreme Court" edited by Kermit L  
Hall. 

On page 422 of the book "Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes"  by G Edward White is  
a letter Holmes wrote to a friend talking about this and several similar  
decisions he wrote:

 "I greatly regretted having to write them and, between ourselves, that the   
  government pressed them".

In another letter he expressed his sorrow, and I don't think guilt would be 
too strong a word, that Schenck was still in jail:

 "I hope the president will pardon him and some other poor devils I have  
  more sympathy"

It's ironic that in his day Holmes was one of the leading advocates of free 
speech but today his most remembered saying is used by those who wish to  
stifle it.

Because if the family shot him for no reason then they would be tried for
murder as well. If they shot him in self-defence when he tries to kill
them (thereby proving he *is* a persistent danger) then they'll have no
case to answer.

Who's to say they're a significant danger, and what danger is he to the
family if they've sold their claim to a collection ageny? He has no
further reason to kill them, and will merely increase his debts by doing
so. He might just be a maniac, but if he is and preys on anyone other than
outlaws he'll probably already be dead.

What he's advocating is something very similar to the situation in Iceland
a few hundred years ago, and what seems to happen in some Middle Eastern
countries today; if you kill someone you pay compensation to their
relatives. In the Icelandic case the claim is transferrable, so that if
you can't collect the fine yourself you can sell the claim to a more
powerful individual or organization who can. Hence there's no benefit to 
killing the owner of the claim because it will simply be transferred to 
*their* relatives or beneficiaries when they die.

Well, I've already said in another post that I can see reasons for
executing some people, but having re-read Friedman's comments I think
he may be correct about fines being better, except in extreme cases.

Uh, he's not walking away freely; he's walking away with tens or hundreds
of thousands of dollars in fines (possibly millions if he's rich). He
either makes arrangements to pay up or no legal system will accept him and
he becomes an outlaw; he's then prey for any real maniacs out there or the
collection agency can kidnap him and sell him as a slave or something. 
Whatever happens he's not going to go on to lead a good and happy life.

Yes. Prosecuting someone who falsely yells "Fire!" in a crowded theater is
not an infringement of free speech. The ticket purchaser and the theater
owner have
entered into a contract. The ticket purchaser has bought a ticket to view a
performance. It's contract law and property rights, not a free speech issue.

I had thought is was a matter of public safety, much like yelling "The
sky is falling!". In a crowded theater, the possibility of people being
injured in the panic evacuation was such that public safety outweighed
indvidual rights to yell "Fire" falsely. Still can't say I agree with it
either, as anyone who blindly follows the false cry of another deserves
to run off a cliff. Stupidity is a capital crime.

Really, how do you put a corporation in jail? How do you execute it?
Granted it can be fined for its actions, but bankruptcy law gives any
corporation the ability to shirk that debt off onto a money losing unit,
spin it off, and close it down, ergo, no fine. Since corporations cannot
be jailed or executed under criminal law, they have greater protection
under the law from government than real citizens do. Perhaps a step
along the road to personal sovereignty is personal incorporation. What
are the limits of legality with regard to corporate/officer/owner
liability? Its been a while, so I don't remember.

Or on the net, of course.  The citation is (249 U.S. 47), and can be
found in many places (for example, on the FIndLaw Legal Resources site
at <http://www.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=249&invol=47>.

Though the court once held that the first amendment did not protect
commercial speech, that position was explicit overturned in 1976 by
Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc. (425 U.S. 748).  The current controlling case regarding advertising
is Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co. 1995 (not yet published in U.S. Reports,
<http://www.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=U10290>).
In that case, the court struck down as unconstitutional a BATF regulation
prohibiting Coors from listing the alcohol content of its beer its cans.

I am curious how important money is to people on this list.

Would you take a job that had little effect on other extropian 
type goals but made you millions in a few years?

Can more be accomplished by funding research (or politics) than
by direct involvement?

What sort of tradeoffs do you see between time spent making money
and time spent doing other things?  How much money is plenty?

For one, you seem to arguing that only "corporations" advertise: many
businesses (like mine) are proud /not/ to be incorporated; we take
full responsibility for the actions of our business, and demand our
full rights as human beings.  Even in the case of a corporation, it
can still be held responsible for fraud and slander just as a person
can, and with that responsibility comes rights.  The two go together.
Freedom implies responsibility, and vice versa.

The fact that a corporation can weasel out of its responsility by
declaring bankruptcy is no different from the fact that a person can
too.  That's a problem, but it's a reason to change bankruptcy law,
not the first admendment.

Yes they do. 

I happen to think that in a short time, what we know of as "privacy"
will be a thing of the past. Some others are not convinced of that. 

The technologies that we are pushing on this list are just as easily
used against us as they are by us and for us. Since these technologies
*will* someday exist, I feel also that the last remnants of what we call
privacy will dissipate into a vestigial anachronism. I have resigned
myself to this, and that attitude has infiltrated my post. 

If you don't believe it will happen, then take issue with me. If you

So is this my doing? I observe that privacy will be eventually and
inevitably be merely an anachronism, and yet, somehow I am also
advocating the death of private life? Words are being put into my mouth
as far as I can figure.

No, we cannot.  Democracy is by its very nature morally repugnant, and
making it more efficient only makes it moreso.  Every man's life,
liberty, and property is his own, and not even a 99.9% vote of his
countrymen justifies interference with his rights.

Yes, this is the simple answer to my long-winded question. I could not
get past the idea that PPA's were merely functioning as states by a
different name. I should have asked instead of trying to demonstrate.

I guess where we disagree is that in my moral universe one's own liberty
and property are never more important than another person's life.

Have you posted your reasons for believing this and I've just
missed them? If not, I'd be interested to hear your reasons.
Several people of my acquaintance have devoted a large portion
of their working time over the last few years to creating
software that people can use to protect their privacy, and
distributing it in a way that will make it difficult for
law-enforcement types to stamp out. Try a web search on
"cypherpunks" for further information.

Defense has the advantage over offense in cryptography issues.
In the Information Era, most privacy issues reduce to
cryptography issues. The attempts by legislators to force people
to use weak cryptography will never be effective against those
who have the time and inclination to educate themselves about
the technologies involved. Cultural transformation could easily
lead to a society in which arrest and imprisonment of those who
use secure privacy software is socially accepted, but that's
hardly inevitable, at least in North America. And even if that
comes about, most hacker scofflaws go unpunished, and the more
hacker scofflaws get thrown in solitary confinement for eight
months (Kevin Mitnick is currently being abused this way, for
instance), the more hacker scofflaws will be motivated to work
on nasty little tricks, and to evade apprehension. 

 > Words are being put into my mouth as far as I can figure.

This is a problem that often afflicts those who draw their
handles from works of literature that are famous among the
audiences they are addressing. I myself put no words in your
mouth: I simply quoted the words of the person whose name you
are wearing.

 > I am really unsure of what you are assuming about me. If thought Big

No, but I haven't seen you present any reasons why you really
think Big Brother is inevitable, and I really would like to hear
more about what they are.

I am curious how important money is to people on this list.

Would you take a job that had little effect on other extropian 
type goals but made you millions in a few years?

Can more be accomplished by funding research (or politics) than
by direct involvement?

What sort of tradeoffs do you see between time spent making money
and time spent doing other things?  How much money is plenty?

You're right, we'll have to disagree on that.  /My/ liberty is more
important to /me/ than your life.  Even though I spoke out against
state-sanctioned capital punishment, I have not the slightest
hesitation upholding a man's right to use deadly force in self
defense, and even in defense of others or liberty or property.

> I am curious how important money is to people on this list.

That's not a meaningful question.  Money is simply a means of
measuring and facilitating trade among people in order to get
the actual things they value.  "How important is money" is them
like asking "How important is importance?" or "How valubale is
value?"

> Would you take a job that had little effect on other extropian 
> type goals but made you millions in a few years?

If it makes me millions, then it /will/ have an effect on
extropian goals; namely, mine.  It will pay for my cryonic
suspension and that of any willing family.  It will pay for my
web bandwidth to publish extropian ideas.  It will pay for any
modifications to my body, by house, my car, may computers, or
other things that assist my goals.  That's what it's for.

> Can more be accomplished by funding research (or politics) than
> by direct involvement?

Funding /is/ involvement.  Money makes it easier for those
people with the most skills at, say, cryonics, to be hired by
those whose talents can be more productive elsewhere.  Money
and trade make the system more efficient, by making things like
human talent and vision more fungible.

> What sort of tradeoffs do you see between time spent making money
> and time spent doing other things?  How much money is plenty?

If you are making money, you are by definition doing what you
can to achieve whatever your goals are.  There is no such thing
as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingless abstractions.

her personality.  Blazing passion for the notion that she is absolutely

Cheers!  I have a homemade sign with the word "evolvEgo" hanging
prominatnly in my apartment. (I added the "evolve" prefix to offset my
dissatisfaction for Rand's inability to acknowledge personal growth and
change, something I've seen a lot of...)

The passage that, for me, embodies much of the beauty of Misss Rand's
sense of life is from "The Fountainhead":

	"Don't work for my happiness my brothers--

		show me that it is possible--
		show me your acheivement--
	and the knowledge will give me courage for mine."
		p. 504

Those words never fail to stir my own passion for the attainment of my
goals.

Exovivo!

Dear fellow Extropians,
The point as to a lack of standards is duly noted and is being taken under 
constructive advisement.
In the interest of peace (and a possible -- but unlikely -- end to petty
quibbling) hereafter I'll use plain script. (At least until someone adopts
and impliments a uniform standard for the transmission of E-mail)

I appreciate all constructive suggestions.
Thank you,

This seems to me to be a very possible future, not one that I necessarily
welcome, but I tend to view its approach with a "who care's" attitude.
Obviously some people here do, and I'd be interseted to hear more on why
they do.  I can deffinitely see a problem if the state is the one looking
over my shoulder, but what of the hoped for voluntary societies?  I'm not
terribly concerned now if people know my business, and maybe that's just
naivete or my virtual lack of anything to hide, but if I'm living in a
community with standards of behavior that reflect my own, namely "crimes"
not comitted against property are not crimes, then I can't see why it
would make much difference if people can watch me go about my "private
life" at home, or elsewhere.  (pardon my long sentence, no time to 
revise ;->)

Exovivo!

Yes, I can't imagine having "enough" money. Bill Gates is now worth over
$30 billion. If I had that much (and even if it were all liquid instead of
mostly tied up in stock) I certainly wouldn't think it was enough. Bill
just gave $200 million (that's not at typo!) to help libraries buy
computers and get more people on the Net. A worthy project, but with that
much money I'd also be funding major amounts of life extension research,
among other things. $30 billions really isn't much at to promote some of my
goals, including getting control of aging in a hurry, bringing about
nanotech, creating good neural-computer interfaces, setting up many good
private schools, influencing third world governments (actually *all*
governments) to move to free markets, researching more efficient space
transportation systems, understanding the brain, etc. 

I've always thought a pretty good test of intelligence was to ask someone
what they would do with $X, and keeping increasing the value of X until
they can't think of anything else to do with it, except buy 50 Rolls
Royce's (as a certain guru did not long ago). I suspect most people on this
list wouldn't have any trouble finding sensible ways to spend their first
trillion dollars.

Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,

At the unfortunate risk of being disagreable I have to state that in the
real world coercion has very little to do with drafting and enacting
legislation. 
Legislation is, in the first instance, not usually written by politicians. 

Legislative drafting is a learned professional skill that many law schools
do not teach. Those of us who write legislation as our livelihood
frequently do so in response to a social problem or need. Very often the
social problems or needs that we attempt to resolve legislatively are
brought to our attention by the effected groups.
On other occasions those of us who have studied sociology and/or psychology
in addition to Public Administration, Public Policy and Law will do our own
research and apply our findings to legislation. 

Obviously, drafting and enacting legislation is no the sum total of all
things. The act of effective implimentation must also be considered. Where
on occasion coercion does take place, it is usually at the bureaucratic
level in attemping to induce compliance from those whose job it is to
enforce the statutes or regulations that they had no part in creating and
were usually not consulted about.

At this point we are dealing with a management problem that is only
slightly related to Extropian philosophy, and appears to be the antithesis
of a dialogue on Anarcho Capitalism.

I'll leave this tangent alone for the time being, unless someone else wants
to pick it up and run with it.      

Enjoy,

A.M. Genen

If you and I are in a conflict with each other and even if we both agree
that 
we don't want the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter and we want
somebody 
else, it doesn't matter, we're stuck with those bozos.
            

        >Anyone who signs the contract (we can call them "citizens") 


Then I am not a citizen of any country, of course you will say that my
heart 
is beating and that is my implicit signature.

PPA's are not euphemisms for states because PPA's do not claim powers that 
individuals do not have. There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do
something 
you want, love, trade, or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep

force to a minimum. Everybody agrees that force is justified in self
defense 
but government claims far more rights than that, more than any sane
individual 
or corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I

object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their booty,

as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. 
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. If government needs labor to fight a
war or be on a jury they feel justified in enslaving me until the task is 
accomplished. They'll make me an offer I can't refuse because I know that
if 
I do armed men will come to my house and drag me away. I don't think 
government should not have more rights than individuals, but then of
course, 
it wouldn't be a government.                                      


        >are also allowed to live in a certain geographical area 


You can join a PPA and live in any geographical area you want.
            

        >Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of government. 


Exactly, it is not the absence of law.


        >Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as an     
   
        >individual person. 
            

Treat horse manure as ice cream and you could have strawberries and ice
cream, 
if you had some strawberries.

If there were no nations there would be no war between nations.

        >single person you come into contact with. 
            

Don't be foolish, nobody is saying make a separate contract with everybody
on  
earth, you just sign up with a PPA of your choice. The PPA makes contracts 
with other PPA's about what laws to follow and how arbitration is to be  
handled. You won't have total freedom of choice about what laws you want to
 
live by and who you want to judge you, but you'd have a lot more choice
than
you have now.

            
        >What about fraud, duress, or unconscionability? 
            

Yes, those are problems unique to Anarchy, fraud and duress and 
unconscionability are impossible today.

Obviously. If it was possible for law  to be completely spelled out like a

but it isn't so there is.

"Money" is just something that is easy to transport, fungible, and a large 
number of people think is valuable. Exactly the same thing would be true in
a 
world of Anarchy, except you would not be forced to use only the currency
of 
the nation you were living in. If somebody tried to tax you by inflation, 
a great favorite among politicians today, you could just switch to a
currency
that was more stable.

Today we don't have small tactical nukes, we have huge multi-megaton

I don't know what you mean by "convoluted" but yes, I expect it would be
about 
as profitable as the industry is now.        


        >not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable resources which 
        >might be used for more transhuman pursuits. 


It's true, a world without crime or war where everyone lived together in 
peace love and happiness would be better than anything I described, so
would 
a world where the tooth fairy was real.

It takes far less than 4 years to kill you dead as a door nail. Only about
25 
years ago the U.S. republic forced millions of its citizens to leave their 
home and fight and often die in a idiotic war 12 thousand miles away that 
they didn't believe in.

Don't be foolish, nobody is saying make a separate contract with everybody
on  
earth, you just sign up with a PPA of your choice. The PPA makes contracts 
with other PPA's about what laws to follow and how arbitration is to be  
handled. You won't have total freedom of choice about what laws you want to
 
live by and who you want to judge you, but you'd have a lot more choice
than
you have now.

            
        >What about fraud, duress, or unconscionability? 
            

Yes, those are problems unique to Anarchy, fraud and duress and 
unconscionability are impossible today.

Obviously. If it was possible for law  to be completely spelled out like a

"Money" is just something that is easy to transport, fungible, and a large

a

of 
the nation you were living in. If somebody tried to tax you by inflation, 
a great favorite among politicians today, you could just switch to a
currency
that was more stable.

It's true, a world without crime or war where everyone lived together in

It takes far less than 4 years to kill you dead as a door nail. Only about
25

Personal incorporation creates a second legal entity, and is
distinguishable from your person.

Corporations legally protect its agents (i.e. employees) from most forms of
civil prosecution and some cases of criminal prosecution.  However, certain
individuals with executive powers do not enjoy the same level of exemption.
 Executive officers can be held criminally responsible for the behavior of
the corporation in certain instances.  In the case of a one person
corporation, this would more or less always be the case.  Legally this
would do little to protect your assets.  Also, unless you have *a lot* of
money, capital gains taxes for the corporation are probably higher than
your personal taxes on the same assets (although a subchapter S corp would
fix that aspect).

For example, in a criminal case against your personal corporation, the
individual as sole executive officer and employee would be directly liable
in virtually all cases, just as though you were an individual.  The rules
regarding this vary little from state to state.  Personal incorporation
produces no net benefit in terms of protecting your assets in a civil
trial.  Your 100% stock ownership is a personal asset that can be taken
away from the individual, and all corporate assets (i.e. 100% of your stock
value) can be taken away from the corporation.  

There is a possible viable alternative.  This is an idea that I have that
might work, although a little complex.  The details in a couple parts are
sketchy.

The above scenarios are based on Corporate laws found in the U.S.  Since
corporations are internationally recognized entities, an alternative would
be to incorporate in a foreign tax shelter.  Anguilla is a well-known
example.  

You set up a corporation in Anguilla ( no corporate income tax ) of which
you are the sole shareholder.  You then become an employee of your own
foreign corporation living in the U.S.  This will require filing foreign
franchise paperwork in the state you live in and usually involves paying a
fee in most states ($800 in California).  You give yourself a minimal
paycheck and have the corporation own your car, house, etc.  The
corporation pays for the taxes that are still incurred on assets.  You are
now *personally* responsible only for paying income taxes on your measly
paycheck.  The corporation is then responsible only for property taxes and
various employment taxes.  A large chunk of your earnings is retained by
the corporation, which is never taxed at a corporate level.  Corporations
generally only pay income taxes in their locale of incorporation.  Because
you are a 100% shareholder, you still own your assets, but they are never
taxable.  The value of your company's stock is subject to long-term capital
gains taxes, so you would never have to pay capital appreciation if you
never sell it.  As long as you aren't stupid about it(***see below), you
could spend the corporation's money any way you like.

The limitation is that your job would be limited to working under the
auspices of your dummy foreign corporation.  For contractors, like many
software developers, this should not be much of a problem.  Many
contractors incorporate themselves locally.

This is just an idea, and not fully researched, but may be workable.


*** The IRS has something called a lifestyle audit, although rarely
initiated, it allows them to arbitrarily set your taxable income based on
their estimation of the cost of your lifestyle.  These are usually
initiated against individuals who live flagrantly wealthy lifestyles yet
claim a very modest taxable income.  It was originally designed to be used
against drug dealers and organized crime figures, but has been used
recently in more general cases.  However, initiation of this type of audit
does require "probable cause".  In the words of a CPA and tax consultant,
if a lifestyle audit is initiated against you, "you're f**ked, pure and
simple".

David Gelernter does not merely *claim to be* a professor of comp sci at
Yale, he *is* one, and a distinguished one at that.  This does not enhance
the truth-value of his theological claims, of course.

I'm not sure that it's altogether appropriate to dub Gelernter a Luddite
when a large part of his hands was blown off by the Unabomber, who actually
is a Luddite.

Gelernter's classic book MIRROR WORLDS is well worth reading, BTW.

I just received another spam - the guys are suggesting me to
send bulk email to 80,000 people for $50.  Spam to distribute spams.
They give their snail-mail address and a reply form that I should
send in with a check.  This is a frequently used technique that
allows spammers to avoid receiving e-mail bombs and to be able
to easily sort the replies.

Now, what if I go for it, and send out a message suggesting people
next time they get a spam with a snail-mail, to mail envelopes to the
spammer's address, containing hate notes, pieces of all kinds of dirty,
smelly, poisonous, explosive, and illegal substances, and everything
else distracting, dangerous, and unpleasant that people can think of?

Could such an "anti-spam spam" help generate enough "negative feedback"
for the spammers to stop asking for snail-mail replies?  That may make
things much more difficult for them.

This suggestion doesn't require adoption of any general standards or laws.

That's my cue... Extropy Institute still has several copies of Mirror

Once in a while there appears a new technology that promises
dramatic social changes. It often comes unexpectedly, from some
modest-looking area of science and engineering, and I always
wonder what is going to appear next.

  One candidate for such new technology may be aerial robotics.
People have been working on mobile robots for a while now.
The most difficult issue with walking robots seems to be
orientation in the environment.
Image recognition is a very costly and difficult task, and it
is essential for moving around on land. Not that much in other
environments though - like air or water.  There are additional
difficulties of aerial robotics: the craft must have efficient
and light-weight equipment for position identification and
communication - but these problems are now resolved with
cellular modems and GPS.
  So now you can build little blimps, planes and helicopters
that can fly around and do things.  Aerial robots may free people
from many tasks that are "dull, dirty, or dangerous" (D3) - or
costly: a pigeon-sized flying robot may quickly accomplish missions
- like deliver your pills from the farmacy, or take a picture of
a corn field from the air - that now require a car or a helicopter.

 You don't have to own an aerial robot.  They may be available for
hire at a very low price (a few dollars an hour or less), and you could
rent one for a 5-minute mission for a quarter.  The robots could also
refuel themselves at automated gas stations, paying with digital cash
there - so they will require minimal maintenance from an owner.

Now, let me list some interesting things that aerial robots could do:

- collect information: a flying robot can visit places, or follow objects,
and record and/or transmit everything it can observe.  That allows you
to fly a little craft with a camera around the Great Canyon, or above the
Eiffel tower (you can control it via Internet, and get images and
sounds back), "virtually visiting" a real museum by flying a WebCam-
equipped blimp through its halls, following wild animals and cute
girls, spying after [potential?] criminals or anybody else, etc.

[  An interesting issue here is that it may be very difficult to identify
   who the robot is serving at any particular moment.  So physical tasks
   can be as anonymous as Internet communications. ]

- deliver small physical objects. Getting pills or apples is one example.
  There are more fun things to do though.  You can drop a dead frog
  on your neighbor's head.  Or spray some foul substance over a crowd.
  Or deliver drugs - quickly and anonymously.  Or shoot somebody from
  the air.  You can also steal small things by driving robots remotely,
  or teaching them to pick up rings, dollar bills, etc.

 It seems that the features of small aerial robots - being aiborne,
cheap and anonymous - allow to do lots of things from which the society
doesn't have much protection.  Introduction of aerial robots that is
likely to happen on a large scale within the next 5 to 10 years, may
deliver multiple benefits, and at the same time create quite a turmoil.
- And wait until we have lots of swimming and running little robots.

If you are interested, there is more practical info at 1997 International
Aerial Robotics Competition page at

Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence,
George B. Dyson, Hardcover, 288 pages. Published by
Addison-Wesley Pub Co, May 1,1997, ISBN: 0201406497. An
astonishing prediction of the World-Wide Web's ultimate
challenge to human civilization: a globally networked,
electronic, sentient being George Dyson grew up at the Institute
for Advanced Study, where such scientists as his father, Freeman
Dyson, and John von Neumann laid the foundations for the
Information Age. From this vantage point, and with an
unprecedented cast of characters, Dyson traces the course of the
information revolution, illuminating the lives, work, and ideas
of visionaries who foresaw the development of artificial
intelligence, artificial life, and the global mind. He
constructs a straightforward, convincing, and occasionally
frightening view of the evolution of mind in the electronic
network, on a level transcending our own. Dyson concludes, based
on several centuries worth of scientific research, that nature
is on the side of the machines. In 1978, George Dyson, along
with his physicist father, was the subject of Kenneth Brower's

Electro-chemical circuits in the brain are almost certainly not used for 
long term memory, people who have survived powerful electrical shocks can 
remember little about the 10 minutes or so before their accident but their 
long term memory is not harmed. The most important storage mechanism of the  
brain is thought by most to be Long Term Potentiation ( LTP). It theorizes  
that memory is encoded by varying the strength of the 10^14 synapses that  
connect the 10^11 neurons in the human brain. We now know that when one  
synapse undergoes LTP it spreads out to other synapses (the LTP signal is  
sent by the diffusion of nitric oxide). This means there must be a large 
amount of redundancy in the storage mechanism of memory and that could help 
a lot if we want to repair a badly damaged frozen brain.
                

        >Since the brain structure is merely the hardware, wouldn't a brain

LTP involves a change in the structure  of synapses.

Chemical reactions at liquid Nitrogen temperatures would be so slow that the 
damage from natural background radiation would probably be more important. 
Even so, your shelf life should be hundreds if not thousands of years. 
Of more concern to me are non technical questions, like will I really remain 
at liquid Nitrogen temperature until the age of Nanotechnology and will
anybody or anything think I'm worth the trouble of reviving, the cost, like 
everything at that time, would not be much but it would not be zero.

No I have not posted any reasons for this at all. What I thought might
lead to a discussion sort of deteriorated into something else. Anyway,
those of you who have read Asimov's Foundation Trilogy will probably see
the parallel coming up.

Does any regime desire revolution? 

IMO, no government wishes to see itself supplanted by another, for
whatever reason. In this sense, a government is by nature
self-interested. Oh, it seems to be quite altruistic, even benevolent at
times, giving "free" lunches and whatnot. But of course, if you toss any
dog a bone he shuts up for a while. Indeed, toss any pack of dogs a bone
and they might not shut up, but at least they'll squabble amongst
themselves (the CIA said, "Let's send crack to the ghetto. That'll keep
their guns pointed at each other -- not us.) 

So given a self-interested government, what does that government do when
discontent reaches a critical mass? To avoid revolution, that government
must crack down (pun intended) on the mischief-makers.

Let's see some current events from the point-of-view of the Fed:

Wacko, TX: Alarming show of conviction (i.e., mass suicide). Americans
may be beginning to believe in things other than God and the
Constitution.

Ruby Ridge: Mass brainwashing can explain Waco, but Randy Weaver was
rational -- which his Congressional hearing appearance proved. A lone
American can actually face off against the might of the Federal
Government without being crazy? 

Unabomber: One man makes it his life work to kill people in order to,
inter alia, send the government a message. But, hey, if at least one
member of every person's family is a rat, we might still be safe.

Militias: Rednecks with ideals. Uttering such blasphemous terms as
liberty, civil rights, the Constitution, etc. Uh-oh. They've got a
shitload of guns, to boot. 
 
Oklahoma City: That does it. These militias are not just ex-vets with
grand Soldier of Fortune delusions. These guys are meaning what they
say, to the tune of hundreds dead from one big old bomb.

Secessionists: Rational people who really don't want to live here
anymore. (See http://www.wavefront.com/~homelands/ ) 

It seems to me that a certain subversive element of the American
psychology has come out of hiding. This country was birthed in the
violence of revolution against tyranny, and revisionism has made us
forget that tyranny is not necessarily relegated to history or modern
third world countries. 

Don't bet the government hasn't noticed.

IMO, it is not difficult to imagine that the machinery in Washington is
slowly grinding out a strategy to deal with this "problem." These
strategists are not the idiots we see on TV. I'll bet they're damn smart
and idealistic as well. They believe in what they're doing, and like
automata they do it relentlessly. Of course, their first target is the
Internet, a bastion of subversive ideas. Sure PGP, SFS and other of the
encryption programs are quite good. But notice the governmental reaction
to their distribution. I'm sure most of us realize it is much less than
positive.

It is this reaction that I must sieze upon. Why would a government care
that its own citizens, and maybe some others from elsewhere, are making
it more difficult for prying eyes to get at their data? The answer is
pretty clear, because some people might, just might have a legitimate
reason for getting at that data. Of course, the government believes that
its legitimate reason is law enforcement. 

There has not quite been a concerted assualt on privacy as of yet. Okay,
certain anti-privacy initiatives have been put into place (I won't run
through them all here -- go to http://www.epic.org 
for details -- but suffice it to say, there have been just as many
setbacks for the government as gains. However, I rue the day my fears
become reality when the first bulletin hits the wires about the new
"wave of terrorism" that is imminent across the United States. This is
all that is needed. I envision legislators arguing beautifully before a
packed Congress that privacy must bow before the "safety" of our
children. Who would dare risk political death by "killing children." The
worst thing ever to happen to civil liberty was the invention of the
"balancing test." As if one's right to freely associate may be curtailed
due to "compelling governmental interest." The tools are all in place.
One smart propagandist need only invent the compelling governmental
interest and the house of cards can be picked apart one card at a time. 

See http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism for starters.

So, when the compelling governmental interest is actualized, and your
tax dollars are finally diverted into thwarting your privacy, you will
be not be able to do a thing -- especially when it becomes a felony for
you to even try.

There is "a uniform standard for the transmission of email". It's called

No. If your potentials were reset, you would lose your short-term memory
(and perhaps some intermediate-term memory), but not your long-term
memory, which seems to reside in synaptic strengths and connectivity
(i.e. "hardware"). People who nearly has drowned in cold rivers have
been revived after fairly long periods of no brain activity with no
loss of identity.

(Strictly speaking, a brain in total equilibrium is by definition a
dead brain, but here we are speaking more about equilibrium of
sodium, potassium and other neuroelectrically important ions. There
is also no reason not to think the revival process can't handle some 
ion leakage if it can handle the other damage)

Judging from studies done on ECT patients, they might lose memory a
few months back. Not that bad for escaping death (and a good start
for an science fiction story: the protagonist awakens from biostasis
only to find out that had been murdered. The only witness was himself
and the murderer, and he can't remember who it was. So the murderer
could be *anyone* in his vicinity... ).

I would say it does, since once all the water has frozen all ion
channels are blocked (and the ions themselves frozen in place). Some
diffusion and tunneling will occur, but it is likely extremely slow.

I agree with that. I have to sort through huge amounts of information
every day, and unless it seems to be very interesting or important I
will not spend the time decoding it, especially if it involves (as in
this case) of saving the file, uudecoding it, transferring it to
another computer and viewing it there. 

ASCII is limited. But that is also an advantage: it is clean,
everyone can read it (even on a toaster running CP/M) and it forces
us to concentrate on contents.

It should be noted that this is not certain (John and I have
disagreed on this for ages :-); most studies of the spread of LTP
have been done using hippocampus slices in vitro, and these results
may not hold in vivo (for example, one study I heard about showed
very different results when done at 21 centigrades than when done at
37 degrees). One idea several neuroscientists discussed at a
symposium I visited was that the NO diffuses "a long way", but that
to achieve LTP you need other factors in the synapse; the spreading
out of LTP observed could be due to synchronous firing (due to the
artificial stimulation) of the other synapses.

I think we'll get our answers sooner or later, there is a lot of
interesting research going on in this field (and there are other
substances beside NO, like CO, that could act here).

The original, and so far almost only realistic, proposal was not a
solid shell but a swarm of independently orbiting solar collectors.
There are no gravitational stresses at all. Some traffic control will
be needed, but it is certainly not an insurmountable problem. 

Note that we have already started building a Dyson sphere by sending
interplanetary probes with solar collectors into solar orbit.

Sorry if Webster hasn't been informed by historians. Historically, the
Luddites existed over a hundred years ago in Britain. The modern
movement, which has not been violent, exhibits the same xeno- and
techno-phobias as its predecessor but is not directly descended from it.
Using the term is as applicable by historians as using the term
neo-Nazi.

Millions and more are needed by existing extropian oriented technology
projects. While I once told a business partner who was getting pushy:
"Money is generic, it doesn't matter who it comes from, and it doesn't
care where it goes as long as it makes as much more of iteself as
possible." However, when it comes to high risk projects, money may be
generic, but it is not nearly as ubuquitous as one would hope.

For every project which is funded, there are a dozens good ones that are
not. If any of use are better at making millions at something besides
research, so be it, more power to you, and gee, I've got this great
project that needs funding.....

Chemical potentials in your brain only store information for a few seconds
or minutes ("short-term memory").  Information that lasts longer than this
is stored as permanent microstructural changes, and will be preserved by
freezing.  Head injuries, electroshock and deep anaesthesia all wipe out the
chemical potentials, and the result is that you lose a short while of memory
from before the insult.  But destruction of short-term memory certainly
doesn't disrupt your personality.

The rates of chemical activity are too small to measure at that temperature,
but theory and experiment agree that the rates drop exponentially with
temperature, so we can measure the rates at higher temperatures and
extrapolate.  The result is a shelf-life of centuries.

Moore's law is a rule of thumb, not a law of nature.  There have been other
periods of exponential growth in technological capacity, and they all came
to an end, usually without anyone realizing in advance that they were about

Commercial air transport improved from 1903 to 1970 at an exponential clip,
and has made essentially no progress since.  Nobody had any idea in 1970
that progress was over.  If we were still on that curve, we'd have
commercial trips to the moon.  The movie '2001' was a plausible

What makes me confident that AI-level processing power is possible is that
(a) nature does it, and (b) Drexler has provided a carefully-worked analysis
of how it could be built.  The timing could be either faster or slower than
Moore's law suggests.  I would not be terribly surprised if economically
feasible semiconductor technology were to bog down after one or two more
chip generations.  The maximum speed of a Pentium might be 500 MHz for
decades, until someone develops a breakthrough technology.

 This is an issue I don't feel we talk about enough, we spend alot
of time talking about the cost of suspension, but little or none
about the cost of revival.

 It would seem we are talking about either a new financial
instrument, or serious modifications of existing ones, there may be
laws that need changing....

 In Bruce Sterlings transhumanist novel "Holy Fire" the heroine
pays for her life extension process by signing over 95% of her
considerable assets, earned after a lifetime of conservative
investing, frugal living, and compound interest, "even inanimate
objects can get rich that way."

Things we need to talk about......

Usually it was politically imposed stagnation by reactionaries holding
progress hostage to force change or to merely maintain the status quo.

And if commercial supersonic flight were not illegal over continental
landmasses, and the fuel embargo had not occured, we would still be on
that curve. It was not a matter of technology. In fact, if you count our
autonomous spaceflight technology, we are still on the curve. The
Voyager and Galileo probes have acheived speeds over 100,000 mph. The
only reason why men are not on those trips is that our risk averse and
security happy society values free lunches for unmotivated ignoramuses
more than exploring the universe.

Sure there may by a maximum speed for that particular computer
technology, but there is no reason other technologies will not surpass
the Pentium chip as it becomes outmoded by economics. The present
progress for quantum computing is an excellent indication that even
greater speeds will be continuously attained.

<David Gelernter may be a professor of computer science at Yale, but
any informed individual can see that he is not only misinfomed about
his own field, but hopelessly behind the times with respect to our
knowledge of neurophysiology if his column in the May 19th issue is
any indication of his knowledge of progress in artificial intelligence
and brain/machine interface.>

I doubt very much if Gelernter writes a "column" for TIME! You should
do a little more research about someone before you flame them based on
a heavily-edited, popular-magazine sidebar.  As Damien Broderick
pointed out, Gelernter is the author of _Mirror Worlds: Or the Day
Software Puts the Universe Into a Shoebox: How It Will Happen and What
it Will Mean_ (1992), one of the premier visions of cyberspace, and
hes also the developer of one of the first parallel processing
languages, LINDA.  Gelernters also the author of _The Muse in the
Machine_. 

A lot of serious AI and cybernetics researchers have doubts about
whether human-level intelligence can be represented by anything
resembling a traditional von Neumann computer. These doubts dont
necessarily imply that theyre worried about a soul or something.

Mike, throughout your essay you equate AI with brain-machine
interfacing, two very different subjects.

<Any computer professional has heard of Moore's Law ... This is the
sort of technological progress that has the inflation and productivity
estimators at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in apopleptic fits.>

So what does this have to do with the price of tea in China? (Are you
suggesting us incompetent BLS bureaucrats would actually get
apoplectic over our work? I thought were all supposed to be parasitic
drones!  (-;)  I dont doubt that microprocessors are becoming more
and more ubiquitous, but, as I noted in our discussion on this earlier
this year, the biggest chunk of the average persons expenditures
still go for such mundane necessities as food and shelter.

<Gelernter is right in saying it is silly to ascribe intelligence to
Deep Blue, as that computer has as much processing power as say, a
housefly or a maybe even a mouse.>

Deep Blue was not just a computer - there was a muse in the machine,
namely the team of people who programmed it with a knowledge of chess.

<While he has the right to claim some supernatural source of our
being, so far he cannot prove that the human mind is nothing more than
a biochemical computer with a neural net architecture. Given this, we
can duplicate that architecture in other forms, even silicon.>

And you cannot yet prove that the human mind *is* nothing more than a
biochemical computer with a neural net architecture.  So your "given
this" assumption is hardly justified. There are serious scientists who
dont believe in "supernatural sources of our being" yet still have
doubts about whether traditional computer architectures, and even
neural nets, are adequate to duplicate what the human mind does.  You
might check the Principia Cybernetica web for starters.

< Associative thinking is, in fact, largely how we think most of the
time, but this can be duplicated by any relational database.>

Then why is it that hundreds of AI researchers working for decades
have yet to build anything close to a human associative memory.  Why
is it that cybernetic systems (real-time process control systems) and
even management decision support systems shun relational DBMS for
object-oriented or multidimensional approaches? 

<The claim that thinking is dictated by emotion is utterly false. At
best our thinking is muddied or even given greater color by our
emotions. Studies have shown that heightened emotions tend to give
greater reinforcement to certain memories, especially experiences
heavily laden with adrenaline, but this behavior can also be easily
accounted for in programming if needed.> 

If theres no emotion associated with it, youre unlikely to remember
it.  Again, youre setting up a straw-man:  Most cognitive scientists
dont claim that thinking is *dictated* by emotion, but they do
believe that the emotional organs of the brain are an essential part
of the long-term memory system.

<He goes on, in the end, to state that even if computers are ever
capable of "simulating human thought", they will never be fully human.
"The gap between human and surrogate is permanent and will never be
closed." This is also false. There have been in the last year,
breakthroughs in electronic interfaces between computer chips and
human neurons.>

Youre mixing apples and oranges again.  Gelernter is talking about AI
- simulating a human-level mind on a computer - a completely different
subject from man-machine interfaces.  Gelernter is talking about the
simulation vs. fabrication problem in systems science, what I call the
issue of whether you can *program* a synthetic intelligence or whether
you have to *grow* one. (Hardly a distinction that the average TIME
reader would be aware of.)

Actually, I like your cyborg scenario and think its probably the most
likely path to becoming post-human; but, its has nothing to do with
the hard questions of AI because theres still a muse in the
machine; i.e., an organically-grown human mind.

Dont get me wrong: I think machine intelligence is possible - we
already have it, with some systems that are much more intelligent in
particular domains than an un-augmented you or I could ever be - but
true AI or SI or A-Life, with creativity and individual will and
responsibility requires a lot more than just the raw processing power
implied by your Moores law reference.

Processing power is only a small part of the story - growing the right
kind of network is far more important.  Those oriented toward
mechanical engineering always seem to assume that the software will
just automagically emerge if you build the hardware properly.  I was
disappointed that _Nanosystems_ totally ignored software issues
(actually, Drexler assumes backward-chaining, broadcast instructions
from a pre-existing higher level - again, a muse in the machine!)

<Charges of racism and heresy will fly. Children and less
sophisticated adults will call each other "chip-lover" and
"bio-bigot".>

But (reread Bruce Sterlings _Schismatrix_), "bio-bigots" dont
necessarily imply religious types who shun *any* change to their
God-given body - it could also refer to those who prefer genetic
engineering and other bio-approaches to augmentation.

<To remove the augmentations will hobble these personalities as much
as a lobotomy would do so to you or I. These transhumans will lead the
way into this future whether neo-Luddites like Gelernter like it or
not.>

Again, what does this have to do with the price of tea in China? 
Augmentations are not AI, and thats what Gelernter was talking about.
 If youre going to label anyone who has concerns about whether
traditional computing techniques can be used to implement AI as a
neo-Luddite, well ...

Excellent FAQ, thanks.

A few more things come to mind:

 o What is the minimal distance from Sun at which a (diamondoid?)
   statite can preserve its crystalline structure?  Is melting
   point or radiation damage the limiting factor?  (In case of a
   red giant it might be possible to sail inside the star for a
   while.)

 o Outgoing radiation doesn't have to have a blackbody spectrum.
   Lasing comes to mind, or one could heat up relatively small
   radiators to a very high temperature.

 o As a matter of fact, outgoing radiation doesn't have to be
   radiation at all, what about gas cooling?  A statite close to
   the star could cool itself by accelerating gas from the corona,
   eating away its host.

Hmm, how is this Anarchy?  If the basic idea of Anarchy is individuals 
acting largely free of government coercion, what you had in Europe prior 
to WW1 were millions of people controlled by governments that were not even
democratic.  Seems way off the mark.   Your point seems to be 

warring states = anarchy 

because both are political systems without laws.  But in fact this is a 
very poor analogy because most Anarchist philosophy is keyed off of the
individual.  Classic examples of Anarchy would be Spain before Franco, 
France at points during the revolution, the situationist uprising there
in '68, other TAZ, the internet, hippie communes, whatever.  But not
the empires of 19th century Europe!  It was against these very 
institutions that classical Anarchy was formulated.  

If you want to talk about groups in relation why not American
Indidan tribes prior to the arrival of Europeans?  At least there individuals
were free to wander off if they didn't like the chief, a privilege almost
never given by nation states to their citizens (prisoners).

     It occurred to me the other day that object-oriented (4GL) programming 
     is following in the same path as carbon-based life's primordial 
     evolution (on Earth anyway).  Metaphorically, if amino acid chains are 
     like 3GL procedural programming, then our first OO programming would 
     be the first "life forms" or objects for independent processing and 
     interaction.  
     
     Extending that metaphor, it could be observed that we are in the 
     processing of creating life using our silicon-based technology that 
     mirrors (intentionally?) our own ancient beginnings.  I'd like to hear 
     from any mondo-advanced programmers about what the next step (or 
     several next steps) beyond distributed objects or other 
     post-Client/Server technology is on the horizon in our technological 
     evolution.

     Michael,
     
     Interesting essay.  I like the metaphor of prejudice applied to our 
     culture's current sexuality conflict.  Although I can see this getting 
     published as an editorial or at least as an abridged letter to the 
     editor, I'd a) grammar check it and b) remove the consternation you 
     attribute to Gelenter's comments.  However influential he may be, even 
     a remotely vicious comment on his opinions or sensibility weakens your 
     credibility as I read it.  
     
     Using your analogy, as a gay man, when people are pounding or 
     resounding too loudly, I'm always inclined to think "where there's 
     smoke, there's fire."  Look at what's triggering your hostility, deal 
     with it and then re-read your comments.  Much potent and innovative 
     stuff.  I just feel that the harshness against Gelenter distracts the 
     reader's attention away from the possibility and toward an unresolved 
     and unamplified personal conflict.
     
     Just a suggestion.  Enjoyed your thoughts.

It wasn't an article, because it was filled with personal opinion and
analysis, that which is normally seen in a column or editorial. He isn't
an editor so he must be a columnists. Maybe an irregular one, maybe a
highly irregular one, but thats the shoe that fits.

And what does this have to do with the price of tea, either? Obviously
since computers are making everything else more efficiently run and
made, this would have a synergistic effect on many ohter products, a
portion of whose cost is in the technology used to make, store,
transport, and sell it. Cheaper or more efficient technology at all of
these levels leads to lower product costs across the board, and
therefore, to lower inflation. Its no mistake that this same bunch
refuse to recognise the validity of dynamic scoring in tax reduction,
entitlement adjustments, etc.

Obviously, its a right piece of magic to make a computer with the

Merely more elaborate approaches to the same concept do not negate the
validity of the concept. If you look at the previous Deep Blue machine,
you will see that it had half of the processing power of the one that
beat Kasparov. Obviously, a human level artificial database will need to
associate aural, visual, tonsorial as well as memories of all sorts of
other modes of perception in many different ways.  This is known. What
is lacking is a machine with enough oomph to do the job. In the interim,
we may be stifled to research with entities like Vinge's DON.MAC AI
Mailman kernel, needing hours of processing time to simulate a few
moments of intelligence. The breakthrough is a machine that can simulate
on a one to one ratio with processing time, or greater.

Because the level of emotion, especially adrenaline linked, amplifies
the clarity of the memory, though distortion of a very clear memory into
false memories or merely false details (as I already stated and you cut
out of the reply) is possible. This can also be programmed into a
machine as a function of the priority of the memory based on the amount
of data input per time period (i.e. the amount of "action") at the time
of the experience.

if you can run the software of the human mind on a computer, and
recognise it as a human intelligence, then there is no reason not to
recognise a human level AI on the same computer as truly aware and
intelligent. If you cannot tell the difference, then there is no
difference. On the issue of whether you can grow an AI on a computer by
itself I say that you cannot raise a human baby to be anything but a
stunted wolf child if it is not raised with a mother or father or both,
so how do you expect to do so with an intelligence thats never existed
before. It will need a nurturing mind in close communion with it to make
it "human" level.

Sorry, I see it as partly good programming, a super powerful processing

I found his spiritual pose to be in line with many of the other most
narrowminded statements made in the past 150 years by intelligent people
who should have known better. Namely:

"Why would anyone need more than 640K RAM?" - Bill Gates
"There is a world market for approximately 2 computers" (or therabouts)
		- IBM, late 1940s
"Heavier than air flight is a physical impossibility that violates the
laws of physics." - Head of the Smithsonian Institute in the late 19th
century
"The airplane will never sink a capital ship." - The Joint Cheifs of
Staff, 1919, shortly before Jimmy Doolittle sunk a captured German
Battleship and Heavy Cruiser with a squadron of biplanes. (No wonder
they court martialed him)
"The use of rocket propulsion in space violates the laws of physics." 
	- The New York Times, in response to Dr. Goddards paper on using
rockets to travel to the moon, early 1920's
"God does not play dice with the universe." - Einstein

At least Gelernter can brag that he's in good company.

Subject: GANN: MAXIMIZING EVOLUTION SPEED & CAM-BRAIN MACHINE : Hugo de Garis, ATR


Dear GANNers,

  My hardware designer colleague Dr. Michael Korkin and I are about to debut 
the CAM-Brain Machine (CBM) prototype (at the GP97 conf) which is an FPGA 
(Xilinx XC6264 chip) based piece of hardware which updates 3D Cellular 
Automata (CA) cells at the incredible rate of over 100 Billion (with a B) a 
second, which makes the evolution of CA based neural network modules possible 
in less than a second (i.e. a complete run of a GA, with tens of thousands of 
CA based neural net circuit growths and fitness evaluations). If this machine 
is as successful as we hope it will be, then I believe the field of GAs and 
particularly its offshoot "Evolutionary Engineering" will be radically 
changed. It should be possible to evolve tens of thousands of such modules to 
be assembled into humanly specified "artificial brain" architectures. If 
"Brain Building" takes off, then large numbers of people will be involved in 
evolving large numbers of modules for all kinds of artificial brain controlled 
products, which in turn will emphasize the need for maximizing the speed of 
evolution. When one looks in the GA literature, there is not a lot on 
techniques for evolving AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I appeal to the GA research 
community to devote more effort into MAXIMIZING EVOLUTION SPEEDS, and I dont 
just mean in terms of hardware, but more in terms of methodologies.


Cheers,

Dr. Hugo de Garis.

P.S. If the first CBM is a success (so far, software simulation experiments 
which test the evolvability of the CBM are looking good), then it is likely 
that further CBMs will be purchasable at about $70,000 each, but probably not 
in 1997, more likely in 1998.

Sorry, but I can't let you off so easily.

1) Legislators and their staffs are paid from funds which are coerced by 
the taxpayers.  So the very act of legislating, as it is currently 
practiced in most locations, has everything to do with coercion and would 
be impossible _without_ coercion.  (Obviously this does does not include 
legislators who work for free, or who are funded [legally] from other 
non-coercive sources, but I'm not aware that such people exist.)

2) In the United States, the Executive branch is prohibited  by the 
Constitution from making laws.  Therefore, if legislators didn't write 
laws, bureaucrats wouldn't have regulations to enforce.  So again, 
legislators play a crucial role in the coercive cycle of politics.

I will rephrase my questions since the answers I am getting
are more abstract than I had in mind.

If you could make 100K per year at a job of your choosing
(MI, aging, writing, whatever) or double that income every
six months (200k, 400k, 800k, etc.) selling cars 10 hours 
per day, which would you pick?  If you picked the car job 
at what point would you stop or cut back on your hours?

I don't mean this to be an abstract question I am curious
about people's strategies regarding the place of money
in their longevity plans. At some point the cost of 
acquiring dollars exceeds their value.

Every now and then someone waves a job in my face that pays
large amounts of money and takes a lot of time.  I keep saying
no, because I think my time is more important and that I 
can make money at something that also has a lot of other 
fringe benefits related to living longer.  I'm just
doing a reality check here by asking other people's outlooks.
Obviously these are individual decisions but I might learn
something from other people's experiences with money and
work.

Work in the field of life extension is clearly valuable
and I am much better suited for it than other sorts of
work but it is quicker and simpler to make money in
more mundane ways.  Given my values and logic this does
not make any sense but the market does not have my values
and does not seem as rational.  

I am looking at is the value of dollars in hand verses
the value of time to do other things.  I have thought
enough about this to realize that for me it graphs as
a exponential curve with plateaus at various places.

There is little I can think of that benefits my day to day
life which cost more than about 150K per year.  Sure more
would be nice but not compared to the hours it takes to
get it.  The relatively expensive things I can think of to
do are no more interesting than the relatively inexpensive
ones so until I change my brain I can have all the fun and
learning and skill development I have time for without a
lot of money.

Beyond personal spending I can think of many things I can do
with money but I am less clear how much it cost to get a
given benefit that would be meaningful to me.  I don't know
a lot about who I might hire to do what work that would help
my longevity more than my own efforts could.

Of course there isn't a limit to how much money is enough
if you are talking about free money but there are tradeoffs 
between making money and doing other things with your
time.  Not everything can be bought with money some things 
take direct effort (physical fitness, health, knowledge).  
I don't know that Einstein could have hired someone to figure 
out relativity or that Ralph Merkle would be better off as 
the CEO of Coca-Cola.

I can assign a dollar value to almost anything but that does
not mean that all of the value I receive is in dollars or
can be bought for dollars.  I have had more money in the
past but I have never been better off, there are other things
in life.

Thanks,
Will

I was shocked by the last chapter of Scott Adams' _The Dilbert Future_.
Most of the book is excellent humor similar to material in the earlier
_Dilbert Principle_, but the last chapter seems off-topic and goes way
over the edge.

Scott Adams starts the chapter off with a seemingly random unsupported
slam against evolution, but then gets far wackier.  He starts talking 
about psychic powers, luck as a commodity, and how repeating an affirmation
15 times a day can alter the very nature of reality due to new discoveries
in quantum mechanics and multiple-universe theory.

I think he should stick to lampooning corporations instead...

Technocracy was invented back in the '30s.  It was yet another mass movement
to reform the society and economy along rational, centralized lines, just
like Fascism and Communism.  Unfortunately, it never got very massive, which
is fatal for a mass movement.  I'm amazed it's still around.  

I had imagined it fading away in the '60s, chapter meetings in
air-conditioned brand-new LA living rooms, each attracting fewer members
than the one before, until the last Technocrat packs up all the handbills,
manfestos and meeting minutes into an old Electrolux box and stashes them in
the attic.

Once you realize Technocracy is an ideology of the 1930s, this paragraph
makes sense (as rhetoric, anyway).  Of course they think natural resources
are important.  Of course they trust teams of top researchers.  Of course
they compare themselves to the 19th century.

Now in the 1930s, this would have made some sense.  Back then, lots of
people had moved off the farms and into factories, gone from hand tools to
machine tools, within living memory.  But nowadays?  Most Americans have
lived in the suburbs amd used power tools for two generations.  And
electricity-- the magic KWT-- is no longer the glorious wave of the future,
that will restructure society in its image.  Nowadays it's the magic MBAUD,
but that's a rant for another day.

I am struck by the melancholy image of the last Extropian, in 2060 or so,
trying to get the point across to a world which has moved on.  Let's hope we
do better than technocracy.  

--CarlF

PS. The word 'technocrat' was reappropriated lately, primarily by the
magazine Economist, to refer to a dispassionate and number-oriented style of
economic/political management.  Suharto and Steven Forbes are both
technocrats in this sense.

So you say that computing power and high quality information are the

The computer is just a machine, the information is the raw material. The

High-quality information is the only *scarce* resource. One planet, one
solar space station, provides enough energy for a posthuman think tank.
The sensors will need some more but it will never get into the area of
scarcity. This trend is visible even today. Look at the internet. OK, it
needs some energy with all those computers and telephone lines, but it's
a HUGE information storage, even without nanotechnology, and it doesn't
take any considerable part of this planet's total energy.

Problem number one is, as I already said, that I think posthumans will
only appear as collectives. If you assume that there is something like a
"meaning of life", then all posthumans will proabably search for it and
act like a collective.

Problem number two is that money is simply dispensable. If you assume
that there aren't collectives but individuals, you must also accept that
there is nothing like a "meaning of life" or that not everyone wants to
search for it. In this case, every posthuman has different interests. It
is likely, or "probably unavoidable", that those with the same interests
will form collectives _again_.

If you think a world with several posthuman individuals is likely,
similar to today's world just with cleverer inhabitants, you must
consider that other posthuman collectives might be worried about this.
For those high-powered individuals might destroy information sources the
collectives need. In this case, the individuals would be "assimilated". 

If posthumans leave the collective for a while to gather information
separately, and they meet other posthumans, they will try to find out
their interests, and if they are equal again, they will probably join.

And for the exchange between several different collectives: that's the
same like exchange between individuals. Assimilation or ignorance. Only
in very few cases it will work like "I tell you this, you tell me that",
or "Give me 10$ (!!!) and I will tell you this, for with the 10 $ I can
buy that other information from the posthuman guy next door, positive
sum game, but consider inflation, too".

Nobody needs a money-based economy.

And you bet that Microsoft would run around shooting and bombing
(kidnapping would be too expensive) people in a "UIF" world. OK, that's
exaggeration, but it is obvious that they would develop some nasty
tricks to stop illegal copying.

The government is not the evil player in our world's game. It's those
who are supporting it, the big industry and the banks, who are "evil" in
the sense that their actions endanger mankind.

I'm no posthuman. I have ethical interests, but any posthuman wouldn't
have such interests. If a posthuman had a "lifesaving ideology", wanting
to save as much life as possible, it would have to fill the entire
universe with life, and even more, it would even have to "turn off"
death in every single lifeform, thus gaining maximum lifespace.

In order to reach posthumanity [as soon as possible], we must avoid the
destruction of our home planet.

I'm not saying that I don't want to use knowledge. Using knowledge is
what I do every day. I say that any posthuman entity has no interest
whatsoever in using knowledge, except for obtaining more knowledge (so
the knowledge is just a BASIS [upon which new knowledge is placed] or a
TOOL [for instance to build special external sensors], but never [or
rarely] a CURRENCY).

I don't want to rule. I want the rulers to rule better.

Hmmm...

After being chucked out of the Freedom Association, Top Thatcher aide and 
speechwriter Robert Moss wrote a best-selling 'roman-a-clef' 'The Spike', 
published Feb. 6, 1980, ISTR.  It recycles the paranoid Rightist fantasy 
that the leading left-wing think-tank in America, the Institute for Policy 
Studies, is a KGB 'outstation', and is also involved with international 
terrorists.   Yet the US has a Foreign Agents Registration Act, so _why 
didn't the FBI_ (which does the US counterespionage stuff too) 'bust' them 
all?  They never arrested or charged anyone, AFAIK.  IPS is still there 
after the Soviets have disappeared.


Rep. Larry McDonald (7th District, Georgia) read some of this stuff into 
the Congrressional Record, afterr Orlando Letelier (former Chilean Foreign 
Minister and Senior Fellow at IPS), and Ronnie Moffet (who worked at IPS) 
were assassinated by a car-bomb on Embassy Row in Washington.

He was also vocal about CIA Station Chief Richard Welch, who  was 
assassinated in Athens, which US Rightists tried to blame on the 
'CounterSpy' people being involved in 'disclosing' his home address (an 
address known to just about everyone in Athens, and identified by the East 
German press much earlier. Nat Hentoff, VP of the ACLU wrote for 
CounterSpy.  John Ranelagh's brilliant book 'The Agency' discusses this 
case thoroughly and exonerates them.. Ranelagh's no 'crazed leftie.'

The .45 ACP automatic pistol used to kill him has since been used in other 
kilings by the shadowy terrorist group 'November 17'.  Note the date.

Interestingly, Larry McDonald was himself later a passenger on KAL 007 
when it was shot down, presumably by the Soviets. An unanswered question 
is why the KAL transponder apparrently did not automatic returm a 
'Civilian Airliner' identifier when 'illuminated' by Soviet radars. If it 
was rigged to return an 'E4B' (Airborne Command and Control) ID, it's no 
surprise that the Soviets got over-eager.

In the UK, Soviet 'Bear'  reconaissance bombers frequently intruded into 
British airspace.  We just sent up a pair of Lightnings, and they formated 
one over the left wing and one under the right wing, and turned it through 
180 degrees..  Photos were later exchanged of crew larking about and 
smiling at earch other...  >:-}

Moss was also a crony of Pinochet's.  He also gave lectures to the 
Argentine Junta's military Academies prior to the Falklands war, telling 
them that the Thatcher government viewd Argentina as the model for the 
whole of Latin America...  He was also the first editor of 'Policy 
Review', the journal of the very powerful Heritage Foundation in 
Washington.

TITLE:  The Open Society and its Enemies...

[This is a brief account of some of my experiences of the "Thatcher Years."
Of course, some of these events may have various possible explanations.
Without there having been an adequate investigation, it's not possible to
know.  I am not making threats, or issuing demands. This file most recently
revised 27 March 1997].

[1978] 18th December; 1:00 a.m. I came within ten minutes of being killed
when a large (@ 150 lb.) car-bomb exploded next to the "Oasis" building in
Holborn (an MI5 outstaion), on my route home.  This was after David Davis and
Graham Smith had stopped their car in Tottenham Court Road next to the YMCA
(where another two bombs exploded in the car park that same night), so that I
could walk home to the Alternative Bookshop in Floral Street, Covent Garden.

[1979] Graham Smith, Gerald Hartup and I were verbally threatened,
manhandled, and our property destroyed, by a dozen SWP and Communist Party
people in the presence of Mr. Gordon McLennan, the Secretary of the Communist
Party (whose assistant fetched the attackers), while we were distributing
entirely innocuous "Freedom Association" literature to the public at Brixton
Underground Station, pointing out the distinction between communism and
capitalism:  "Under Capitalism, you are free to criticise Capitalism.  Under
Communism, you are also free to criticize Capitalism."

    On several occasions while I was living and working there, bricks were
thrown, smashing through the front windows of the Alternative Bookshop at 40
Floral Street; and telephoned threats were received, as well as other acts
directed against the property.

July 1879: I was dismissed from my job at "The Freedom Association",
supposedly for attending an ISOS/Heritage Foundation Summer School at
Cambridge during my holiday, at which I was asked by the ISOS organizers to
give a talk on libertarian ideas. This was after an article by the notorious
right-wing conservative and police witness Ernest van den Haag attacking
libertarianism had been published by the American conservative magazine
"National Review" in their July issue. Van den Haag was a participant at the
Summer School, as were Gerald Frost, Geordie Hayward, Diana Bowen, Graham
Smith and Keith Joseph.

    Afterwards, a letter was brought to my attention, dated 14 August 1979,
written by the director of "The Freedom Association", a Defence intelligence
Staff army major, Derek Jackson to Lord de l'Isle, the chairman, saying that
"It might be said that we have already in part neutralised the situation as
the two most outspoken of the Alliance are Hollick and Chris Tame." Graham
Smith was not objected to, it seems.  A month later, my friend Gerald Hartup
was also dismissed, but Jackson and Smith themselves were ousted before this
came into effect.

[1980] Feb 4; My aunt and godparent Mrs. Joyce Pike was found dead in a
river, supposedly from drowning, outside Glenside Hospital, an hour after
news of a "mistaken diagnosis" of depression had been notified to me by
telephone by her consultant, a Dr. Charneaud. This was after she had been
subjected to months of ruinous hospitalization at Barrow, extended
electroshock (at the hands of Drs. Rooth and Hughes) and drug "treatment"
entirely inappropriate to a _thyroid condition_.

    She herself said her problem was pain and disability casued by an
incompetent knee operation, which had left her hardly able to walk, and look
after her husband.  My telephone calls were made from a phone subject to
interception, at the Alangate Group Chairman's office.

[1981] On 3 June I had to abandon my home completely and immediately , on 
police instructions from David Hedges, after threats were made against me 
and the life of my pet cat on 2nd June by one Rex Smoothy, a criminal.  He threatened to cut Beeper's throat in front of me.

This necessitated my moving immediately to David Davis's house in Denmark 
Rd., Bedford, more than sixty miles (five hours a day travelling time) 
away from my place of work.

[1982] My main client company (the Alangate Group of employment agencies) was
finally deliberately and unlawfully put out of business by Inland Revenue
Special Office officials, owing me #1,700.00, and leaving several thousand
people without work, and this after John Blundell, Gerald Frost, Lord
Cockfield and others at the Centre for Policy Studies had been told what was
going on.  This was the second time this had happened.

1982: My uncle and godparent Bertram Pike, a retired trade union leader, was
found dead (and his will was found to have been changed; no probate document
was ever received). One of his friends has said there was something
suspicious about his death; I have no means of knowing.

July 1982: The MI5-controlled publication "Searchlight" published an article
attacking George Miller, a young Liberal Party officer and NTS anti-Soviet
activist; and the Libertarian Alliance, a small human-rights group which I
had helped to found.  This attack 'coincided' with the KGB arresting NTS free
trade union activists in Russia.

22 Aug; A contentious Libertarian Alliance (LA) foreign policy day-school
took place.

October; the LA dispute worsened. At Chris Tame's request, I went to his
assistance, and that of the Alternative Bookshop and George Miller. A
sub-group of Libertarian Alliance members, led by David Ramsay Steele and
Mark Brady, and supported by the American-based Institute for Humane Studies
and SEARCHLIGHT, were trying illicitly to seize control of the Alternative
Bookshop and the LA.

20 Nov; Michael Zegarac threatened to arrange for the Socialist Workers'
Party to fire-bomb the Alternative Bookshop, if Chris Tame got into a fight.
Steele repeatedly threatened to publicly "name" Chris Tame, Judy Tame, myself
and others as "intelligence agents", implying that we were acting under
direction, when -- as far as I know -- none of us ever had.

15 Dec; A menacing -- blackmailing -- letter from David Ramsay Steele
addressed "To Whom It May Concern" was forwarded to the DPP by our --
concerned -- Solicitors.

24 Dec; A very unpleasant entrapment attempt took place, when a "security
guard" approached me in a railway carriage, asked me if I had a "shooter",
and then offered to _kill_ Steele and his associates for money.

25 Dec; These incidents were pre-emptively reported by me to the Metropolitan
Police, who seemed in no hurry whatsoever to obtain a description of the
'hit-man'.

[1983] 9 Jan.; After further efforts on my part to get the authorities to
deal with the deteriorating situation, I was asked by the Anti-Terrorist
Branch at New Scotland Yard (C13) to stay on after Hillel Steiner's inquiry
at the Waldorf Hotel so as to learn more of the intentions of Steele and his
associates.

11 Jan.; I did so: more threats, and violent attacks by Steele occurred (and
were reported by complaint later that night to C13)

13 Jan.; According to a C13 officer, the matter was the responsibility of the
Metropolitan Police, Special Branch (C11). During a meeting with two of their
people which took place at Beckenham Police Station, which they started by
saying that they were investigating allegations of security "leaks", it was
rather obvious they would prefer these matters to be ignored, and hints to me
of ten-year terms of imprisonment for "conspiracy to murder" making it harder
to leave the country rather emphasised this. They seemed quite friendly. I
would not want to harm Steele's life-chances, and I would also prefer a quiet
life. I said I did not want to press charges for assault and threats to
murder, and that I wanted Steele to rejoin his American wife in America.

[ The officer was Detective-Inspector Ray Dowd ]

    On returning to the U.S., Steele, with his friend Brady, rewarded this
forbearance by publishing a variety of abuse, disinformation and allegations
of involvement with British intelligence and so on, in "Libertarian
Vanguard", a publication controlled by US government informers.  When I
discussed their threats of further 'revelations' with Special Agent Dolan of
the San Francisco Branch of the FBI, he pointed out that the First Amendment
prohibited pre-publication censorship, and asked _me_ for a written
complaint, even though the LV article was in blatant breach of the US
Intelligence Identities Protection Act.


    At that time, the Reagan administration was apparently trying by means of
National Security Directive D84 to get powers of prior restraint on
publishing, in violation of the US Constitutional guarantees of freedom of
the press.  I received hints that if Chris Tame and/or his wife Judy and/or
myself had been attacked or killed by 'terrorists' this would have been most
helpful to passage of such further measures.


    Since then, Brady and and some of his associates have received tens of
thousands of dollars from Institute for Humane Studies-linked funds. (This
may be what I.H.S. (a Koch front) calls "recruiting intelligence officers for
freedom:" paying America's enemies to attack America's friends).


    Since then, my telephone has been monitored and obstructed (obtrusively);
my mail has been opened or 'disappeared' (obtrusively); someone with SIGINT
knowledge may explain more about the monitoring of word processor
radiofrequencies. Other unusual and unpleasant incidents have occurred.


17 November 1982: Ashford, Kent; My friend Andrew Robert Dennett, whom I used
to accompany to church when he was five years old, was found dying of cyanide
poisoning. He was 19 years old. I learnt of this after receiving a letter
from Steele's associate Steven Berry, at ESOC Darmstadt, West Germany,
referring to "a leather-bound set of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica." This was
a gift given by me to Andrew, Peter and Terence Dennett when they were
children, at Christmastime in 1969.

    The existence of a cassette tape-recording was pointed out to me, and I
asked Andrew's step-father for it; I then listened to the recording, made by
Andrew prior to his death.  Andrew Dennett had recorded his belief thast his
life was being destroyed, as well as his fear that he was going to be
murdered, and naming those he feared were going to kill him as Klara Barrett
and his step-father Michael Dickens (a Freedom Association member). The
existence of this tape-recording was notified to New Scotland Yard within 24
hours; the interviewing officers' existence was denied; there was no
follow-up at all.


13 October 1983; Margaret H. Thatcher's birthday. My pet cat Beeper's
still-warm and floppy dead body was handed to me in a black polythene bag at
6 o'clock in the evening at the local Veterinary Hospital. I had been told
that Beeper had died 'under anaesthesia' at 10 o'clock that morning. A "vet"
was obliged to leave the country a few days later for illegally 'operating on
human beings.' [I had asked 'Dr.' Robert Lefever for a 'second opinion.'

    In the same week, George Miller's car was rammed. Coincidentally, Two
cars hired by Jeremy Shearmur from Hertz had mechanical failures. Jeremy's 
a skeptic.

[1984] 14 Jan; After spending the evening with Jeremy Shearmur, I was
attacked, head-butted and maliciously injured in Croydon Road, Beckenham,
while trying to arrest a man who had attacked and injured my landlord's son.
The police were called, and seemed very uninterested. After 15 minutes they
were persuaded to note a description of the attacker. They were not heard
from again.


    7 February 1984; Andrew Dennett's brother Terry was hospitalised with a
broken neck in New South Wales, Australia, after his car was rammed in a
head-on crash by an identical stolen BMW, registration no. BS 201. (BS 201
happens to be the basic CIA file descriptor).  Both cars were destroyed by
fire. The other driver disappeared. This happened one year to the day after
Brady's associate Michael Zegarac issued a document mentioning "measures" he
and his associates would be taking, and one year to the day after Jorge
Amador's "Better Red than Dead" article was published in the US.


    July 1984; All mention of these events was censored from the publication
"Free Life: The Journal of the Libertarian Alliance", which I edited, after I
had sent the copy for the issue to the printers. This was done on the
instructions of Jillian Becker, the self-styled "terrorism" expert and 
RENAMO apologist.


    [1985] As confirmed by John Warden, the Daily Express Political Editor,
abuse and disinformation instigated by Mr. John Selwyn Gummer and his
associates at Conservative Central Office, and directed against conservatives
and libertarians as well as the Libertarian alliance, was published on the
front page of the Daily Express, on national ITV news, and elsewhere. By this
time I had ceased work on medical advice, with a diagnosis of "stress
reaction." My employment was subsequently lost. The Daily Express paid
four-figure sums in damages to Chris Tame and Madsen Pirie.


    A man was charged with and convicted of arson with intent to endanger 
life after another fire-bombing at the Alternative Bookshop, while Brian
Micklethwait was staying there. On the very same day, the "private-sector"
doctor R. Lefever (another "Freedom Association" member, whose stated concern
for "state secrecy" seems to exceed his concern for the well-being of the
patients who pay him) was telling me I was being "paranoid" and that I was
"imagining" these incidents (having previously told me the very same
incidents (including the three 'non-accidental' deaths) were connected in a
way I would never discover, being part of a "plot" being perpetrated by "the
KGB", based at 9, Poland Street, London W1, according to him, who were
"trying to drive us crazy" as part of a plan to diminish the effectiveness of
anyone opposing the KGB).


    Counter-Information Services, the UK affiliate of Transnational Institute
(the international wing of the American Institute for Policy Studies), as
well as the Tory Reform Group, also used 9, Poland Street, which was
controlled by the Rowntree Trust. The Rowntree Trust, (which with Keith
Joseph also took part in establishing the Centre for Policy Studies), had
Chitnis as chairman at the time. Chitnis is also a close associate of David
Steel, the Liberal Party politician.

    Since that time, further unpleasant incidents have occurred.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

    The cumulative effect of being subjected to this continued misconduct,
without adequate defence or support, has been to deplete my resources of
skills and intellectual and financial capital, and to make it almost
impossible to plan ahead with any confidence so as to earn a living. I am
presently receiving prescribed mild tranquillizers (to mitigate anxiety) and
prescribed anti-depressants (to mitigate a profound sense of grief at having
my life, my relationships and my life-chances damaged). And those are the
only drugs I have had anything to do with (to my knowledge). I am at this
time disabled and unable to work, with a diagnosis of reactive depression
and/or post-traumatic stress disorder.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

    The response of the "Conservative" government to these and other
incidents has been quite disgracefully negligent, inadequate as well as
incompetent. I do know that I have not done anything injurious to anyone. We
might have expected that the authorities would help us to resolve the
problems, and that they would at least try to provide adequate safety
measures and restitution. So much for "defending freedom." So much for "the
Rule of Law."


    As the Tory Government allows this country's free-society intellectual
activists to be messed around like this, it is not really surprising that
their policies continue to lose support by the day. If the abilities and
energies and resources of our "brightest and best" are dissipated by such
unpleasantness, is it any wonder that our country has so many unsolved
problems? Or that people become reluctant to speak out in defence of a free
society, with disastrous consequences for the quality of life and the
prospects for any real national security?


    It is a matter for some regret that, after so many years of effort trying
to make this a country where individual freedom, ability, courage,
independent thought and civilized behaviour are respected, valued and
protected, I should have to say, with very considerable regret, that for me,
the "Thatcher Years" proved to be an unnecessarily costly and miserably
disappointing failure.


    I think it is fair to say that what has been going on in this country
does not come close to measuring up to the standards of administration for an
Open Society which Karl Popper could have considered to be anywhere near
satisfactory.

Message 2813 from anduril, 3904 Jun 17 20:17 97 1
[snip]
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        One Dr. Robert Lefever made an appalling mess of my life for a 
while. I was a paying customer, BTW.  The Secretariat of the Ethics 
Committee of the GMC _asked me to make a formal complaint_, after my 
enquiry had been 'bounced' by a hack staffer who told me 'nothing we can 
do.'  The Committee then said there was nothing they could do, after all.  
Surprise, surprise.  Lefever has (or had) some very prominent and 
influential Thatcherite Conservatives as patients.


        He told me that my aunt (who was found dead in a river outside 
Glenside Hospital an hour after her consultant had informed me of a 
'mistaken diagnosis' -- a diagnosis that resulted in massive electroshock 
and wholly inappropriate drug 'treatment' for her supposed 'thyroid 
disorder') had been killed.  She was actually suffering from a botched knee 
operation. Negligence lawsuits, anyone?  I was told by a senior adviser to 
10 Downing Street that all the relevant witnesses would be issued with 
immunity certificates, to prevent them being subpoena'd and compelled to 
testify.  Sound familiar?


        He told me that her husband had also _not_ died accidentally.

        He told me that my young friend Andrew Dennett had been killed 
(Andrew had been found dying of cyanide poisoning on november 17, 1982. He 
left a tape recording stating his belief that he was going to be murdered. 
 I notified this to Special Branch at NSY.  Nothing was done -- no 
follow-up at all.  The first time this information appeared on the 
Coroner's file was around the time that Thatcher resigned).

        He told me 'the KGB' were involved, and that he had access to 
'secret information'  confirming this, which was denied to me.

        Imagine, if you can, being told that three people you loved had 
been murdered to 'get at' you because of your _political activities_, and 
thant there was _nothing_ you could do about it.

        Oh, (and the least of my problems), he stuck something violently 
into my 'back passage' without bothering to ask for my informed consent 
first.  I hadn't visited him with any problems in that region of my 
anatomy. In the States, this can constitute felony rape.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        Lefever now owns and runs a vastly costly 'addiction treatment 
unit' in Kent. According to the Professor of Psychiatry who examined the 
Unit, he utilizes Sargant's 'conversion' techniques (i.e. brainwashing), 
which physiologically alters brain functions by imposing unbearable stress.
 
        His patients may be referred by the police or the courts, or their 
parents, or their employers, or the government.  Or, they may be told that 
the alternatives to attending his 'Unit' for his 'treatment' may be very 
unpleasant.  And that, should they try to _leave_ during 'treatment'...

        This constitutes an ethical basis for _informed consent_?

        If someone were to get their 'jollies' making people suffer, or 
watching them suffer, what a great place to work!  According to their 
office, _all_ the staff are (or were) 'graduates' of his treatment regime. 
He wants to sue for libel? Well, I (and others) can always counter-claim.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

        According to 'The Dictionary of Espionage' (Stein and Day, New 
York), MI6 have a Section, P4, which recruits doctors, lawyers, and other 
'professionals' as informants and operatives, in grotesque breach of 
professional ethics and the hippocratic oath.


Ditto for MI5. 

Ditto for the police.

Ditto for Social Services.


"Professional ethics"?  Please, don't make us all laugh...

Interleaved comment here:

Lefever stole the PROMIS medical information system name, told his 
patients he was using it, and completely failed to provide any of the 
elements of the PROMIS procedures: He calls himself PROMIS medical 
services.

I did then.  I _trusted_ the man.  And this was all in the context of the 
'Cold War', and some pretty hideous things happening to me directly.  A 
lot of our worst fears had eventuated.

I was terrified of even _discussing_ all this for years.

Now, I've considered and discussed so many possiblities, it's hard to be 
certain any more.  A Public Inquiry might get to the bottom of it all.  
The maddening thing is that the necessary information and reports are on 
file with MI5, MI6 and CIA, just for starters.

But that won't happen, I'd guess.  For rather obvious reasons....

I have a 20k. ASCII file available on all this, BTW.   A chronology.

>> because of your _political activities_, 

> what activities were these, Tony?

Inter alia:

I was and am an active individualist radical liberal, associated with 
other like-minded people, including anarchists of various hues.   We were 
valuable to the intellectual architects of what became known as 
'Thatcherism' -- Chris R. Tame worked at the Freedom Association, and the 
Centre for Policy Studies.   David Ramsay Steele did some work for Keith 
Joseph, whom I'd met several times, along with Geoffrey Howe and various 
other 'name' political figures.


Without acting under their direction or control, or beinmg paid for it, 
some of us might just on occasion have helped MI6 and CIA folk in 
smuggling 'subversive' literature into various despotic countries.  All 
part of the 'War of Ideas.'  >:-}

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

We had the Alternative Bookshop, with something to attract (and offend) 
everyone.  Firebombings.  Death threats.  Window-smashings.

>From 1978 to 1980, (even though i was summarily fired in July 1979), I 
worked as Office Services Manager for the Freedom Association <sigh>, 
described by Thatcher as 'probably the most effective organization 
fighting for our freedoms in Britain today.'  Ref: Hugo Young, 'One of 
Us', p. 111

Also, see Brian Crozier's recent book 'Free Agent', and LOBSTER 11.


I was fired for giving a talk on libertarian ideas during my holiday (!), 
to a 'Free Society' Summer School organized by the UK end of the Heritage 
Foundation in Washington, at the invitation of the organizers.  

One of the participants was Ernest van den Haag, a US academic who was a 
police witness in the judicial murder of Lenny Bruce, the comedian.. 

Assistant Attorney General in the case, Vincent Cuccia said: "We knew what 
we were doing.  We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy ... We watched 
him fall apart. We used the law to kill him.'

Then we started the Libertarian Alliance, to further our own ideas.

Hey, ho!


So we were upsetting lots of people, you see:

[1] MI5, who are an immiscible culture vis-a-vis MI6.   [The TV series 
'The Prisoner' portrays this brilliantly. Written by George Markstein, 
senior MI6 officer... ]  MI5 exists to prevent radical change in this 
country -- _any_ kind of radical change.  It's rather good at it.

[2] The Marxist 'Left', who disliked our market economics and our 
anti-collectivist bias, and our aversion to Statism and determinism.

[3]The Fascist Right, who hated our position on race, immigration, 
individual liberty, and freedom of thought and expression.

and 'SEARCHLIGHT' magazine, which manages to combine all three of these...


The authoritarian Tories:

The authoritarian elements in the Police.

Inter alia, Madsen Pirie, President of the Adam Smith Institute, told me

be invited to his birthday dinners.  Not any more.

Always remember, you did ask.  >:-}

There quite certainly have been a _series_ of 'coverups.'  Quite what of, 
is not entirely certain.

If my aunt and God-mother had been deliberately tortured to death in the 
most hideous manner, it would have looked no different to what actually 
happened.

Check out the ongoing case of the hideous death of JonBenet Ramsey on the 
Web, and you will understand rather better, why it is that some people are 
_extraordinarily_ reluctant to talk about various things.

[What was her father involved with?  Her death has all the hallmarks of a 
'demonstration' killing.]

Check out the death of Patricia Luna Wilson (writer Robert Anton Wilson's 
daughter) who was found battered to death, aged just 15, with a bloodied 
MasterCharge machine lying next to her.  "For a few dollars more..."

Would anyone here want this sort of thing to happen to _their_ family?

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

I notified details of the circumstances of Andrew Dennett's death, and the 
tape recording he left behind, to Special Branch at NSY immediately upon 
learning of it, and hearing the tape (a hideous experience -- 
'Schrechtlichkeit', as the Germans say).  I was told that the name I gave, 
of the senior SB officer who interviewed me at Beckenham Police Station on 
13 January, 1983, _didn't exist_.  I called several times.  Got me 
no-where. No follow-up at all.


Three other witnesses heard this tape also.  I didn't 'imagine it.'

[The SB officer was Detective Inspector Ray Dowd.  He certainly does 
exist. I spoke with a colleague of his just the other day.  _So why was I 
repeatedly told by the SB switchboard they had no officer of that name on 
the staff?_]


I notified the Ashford Coroner's Office three times.  The relevant person 
was 'on holiday' or 'away for the day' or the safe was locked and someone 
else had the keys (rather apt, that).


A police officer friend of mine, David Hedges, tried three times to 
contact the Kent Police to get them 'on the case', apparently without 
success.  Coincidentally, he was busted off the Force a bit later, on some 
pretext or other.  

Even more coincidentally, his youngest son was killed in a motorcycle 
smash a couple of years later.  He was around Andrew's age. Maybe just 
another 'accident.'

MPs and senior Government advisers in Britain and the US have been told. 
Nothing happened.  Zilch.  It's the _total lack of response_ tht's 
interesting.

          ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

In 1990, , I gave a signed written statement by way of complaint to 
Bristol Special Branch. I was asked sternly:  'Why haven't you raised this 
before?'  [ROFL!!!]

The officer said he'd get back to me with the Coroner's reports.  He 
'vanished' too, and was not seen again.  He was promptly moved to another 
post.  But the details of the tape etc. appeared on the Coroner's file on 
Andrew's death at that time.

Thatcher resigned pretty well at the same time.  Coincidence, no doubt).

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

At the request of his Personal Private Secretary, I sent a 20k. Fax copy 
to Douglas Hurd's personal fax number at the Foreign Secretary's office at 
the Foreign Office.  He announced his retirement from politics a little 
bit later. Just another coincidence, no doubt.  Ask him why there was no 
follow-up, and the man I spoke with about this was posted out of the 
country, to Hong Kong.


'Coverups'?  On _this_ scale?  What sort of country do you think we've 
got here, Peter?  


Fire up your Search Engines.

Do a Web Search for 'November 17' to start with.  The date of Andrew's 
death.  Someone's 'calling card', perhaps?  Such things do happen.

Do some 'NameBase' searches, and check out the links and contexts.

Then check out 'Robert Moss' (who was chucked out of the Freedom 
Association -- then named 'The National Association for Freedom.' a bit 
before I went to work at its HQ).

Then 'Richard Welch'

Then 'Larry McDonald'

Then 'CounterSpy'

Then 'Transnational Institute'

Then 'Heritage Foundation'

[ Then 'Edwin J. Feulner' ]


Then we'll talk some more.

'Good Hunting', all!

I would like to think that as a society we could evolve to such a point 
that privacy was a non-issue.  Below is why I think it is still a major 
issue, and of great importance to me.

  You can be assured that there is a sizable minority of people out 
there, who would view any of things you do in the privacy of your own 
home to be "immoral" and "wrong", and would like nothing better than to 
punish you severely. Just having sex with your partner in perhaps any 
position other than the missionary would be considered by many to be "an 
act against god" and worthy of your incarceration.  In several states in 
the south there are still people being put in jail for just such 
"unusual" sex acts.

   I'll go out on a limb to say that I engage in some rather unusual 
antics around the house - from running around with jello on my naked 
body to talking in pseudo-languages while making outrageous jestures 
with my body and face, to just having crazy fun in whatever way my 
spirit moves me.  I also happen to perform very well on my job and am 
respected by my friends and collegues for being one of the sanest people 
they know.  However, if there were cameras in my house observing and 
recording my every move I'm sure the verdict would be quite different.  
I would probably have a hard time getting hired anywhere "respectable".  
Since I live in a rather small town, I might get chased out of it as 
well!

Yes, because I could use that money to fund the things that really matter
to me. That's essentially what I'm doing, though sadly my current job
doesn't pay millions. Were it not for the relatively high salary I'd be
doing something very different.

I said nothing of the kind. I said that you can't define the

Comparative advantage. Of course, that's a term of art from the
field of economics, which you can't be bothered to study,
because you're so smart you've already figured out that it's all
crap.

Oh, yeah, all the computers and storage media devices will just
grow on trees. St. Drexler says so! (I hope that if Eric Drexler
reads this, he will forgive me for calling attention to a popular
misapprehension of his work, a misapprehension against which he
has worked and for which he is not to be blamed.) And yeah, the
"quality" will just happen magically. Never mind, Erik Moeller,
that you have no clue what the causes of quality are. If you do
have a clue as to what causes quality, perhaps you'd like to share
it with us.

Well, your faith is very touching, Erik, but some of us have open
minds. It is entirely possible that I will be absorbed into some
delicious ubercollective in the next forty years, and I might even
decide that this is the right thing to do before it comes down to
that. But right now, I don't know, and right now, that is not to
my taste (in part because it does not accord with my theories about
how quality emerges, which I will keep to myself because I haven't
tested them for long enough yet), and I certainly wouldn't expect
to win any arguments by handing people my Article of Faith that
We're All Going to End Up in a Big Collective Anyway.

I think every posthuman has different interests, and the thing that
I find particularly annoying about you is how determinedly you
throw yourself into the world trying to force everyone to have the
same interests. "Not everyone wants to search for it"... you have
hit the nail on the head, right there, Erik, but apparently you
don't realize this. Different people, even different postpeople,
have different values, and this is PERFECTLY OKAY. It's only a
problem when they start killing each other over their differences...
I think you and I agree on that.  But trying to smoosh everyone's
values into one Big Collective Value just makes everyone desperately
afraid that the final Big Collective Value is not going to end up
looking even remotely like their current values, and then their
egos are terrified and they start fussing and fighting and blowing
things up. We are still just apes with our heads bloated with
absorbed partial computational results (culture) from the big
memetic evolutionary process. And we can do a hell of a lot of
wonderful things with that... but not if we pretend that it's not
so, or that we are somehow perfect already. You can't force people
to be boddhisattvas, especially not by taking away all their money.
They have to do it from their own hearts or not at all.

Money is a communications medium that helps to automatically and
nonviolently reconcile the differing, varied values of different
people.  You can only dispense with it if you accept the Moeller
Dogma that Everyone Ought to Have the Same Values. I utterly reject
that Dogma at present, so if you want to talk me into believing
it, I invite you to get down to business. So far you've used that
dogma to defend your arguments, but you haven't defended the dogma
itself.

It would be a hell of a lot easier to explain money to people if
we still used chemical elements instead of gummint counterfeit,
because in a chemical-element currency system it's fairly easy to
see that money is just a special-case refinement and technical
improvement of ordinary barter. And barter is just a means by which
people can cooperate to use their varied resources to fulfill their
varied values.

Why is this concern of the collectives more legitimate than the
concern of the individuals that the high-powered  collectives might
destroy information sources the individuals need? Your argument is
curiously one-sided.

I see a lot of assertions above, and a couple of nice just-so
stories, but I don't see anything that looks like deduction,
argument, or evidence. Am I supposed to believe this stuff just
because you say so? "They will probably do this, they will
probably do that, this other thing probably won't happen." Why
are you bothering to post such drivel?

Another interesting thing about this argument is that I'm not making
any claims about what sorts of things posthumans are likely to
value (except that they'll probably value more than JUST ONE THING),
whereas you seem to be claiming that not only do you know that
all posthumans will value JUST ONE THING, but also that you know
what that ONE THING is. A rather presumptuous claim, it seems to
me. It's entirely possible that posthumans will spend all their
time chasing after things you and I simply haven't got the
conceptual apparatus to even begin to imagine. Can we have a
little acknowledgement of that, please? To quote Dr. Evil,
"Throw me a bone here."

I mean, "I'm Erik Moeller, smartest collectivist uebermensch in
the galaxy. You people are all helpless-minded, like children."
might make you feel good, and it might even be true for all I know,
but it's certainly not going to persuade anybody on the Internet.

I'm no fan of Microsoft's, but you're just making yourself look
like a paranoid 2600 reader, like that guy who was writing in to
say that the Federal government ought to take over the American
phone companies. Microsoft really don't care about illegal copying
unless it hurts sales, which means the only illegal copying they
worry about is illegal copying within large corporate and governmental
organizations (such as is rampant in China, for instance). Microsoft
are hardly going to be shooting or bombing punks like you and me
(except for the unfortunate few who are "made examples of"), and
large corporations and some governments respond to lawyers much
better than they do to troops. People who hack corporate systems
for a living (like Bill Gates does) understand this.

I think the things that endanger mankind are considerably more
complex than capsule summaries such as this one. Socrates and my
dad both claim that evil is illusory, and that it is only
ignorance that endangers mankind, and I haven't been able to
refute either one of them yet, although I do maintain my doubts.
You might like to know that the world is full of people who
immediately turn off their ears whenever they see someone on a
soapbox prating about good and evil (not that I'm one of them or
antyhing).

Maybe. I would like to believe this is true. Expectation foils
perception. I am quite fond of our home planet, except for the
inconveniently intense gravitational field (which I understand was
necessary to get things started). I'm also not quite sure that
Reaching Posthumanity (quickly or otherwise) is the Main Thing,
since no one seems to agree on what that means, much to my
approval.

Well, if knowledge is the only thing you value, then why are you
blathering instead of studying? I know that's a terribly snide
thing to say, but value-monists are always leaving themselves
open for remarks like that.

Oh, right, you're a *collectivist* value-monist, so you want to
make sure that *I* learn your knowledge too. Look at the little
memetic salmon rushing madly upstream, propagate, propagate,
propagate, MUST SPAWN! (Not that I disapprove of literary
ambitions... far from it. I was once there too. I just try to be
a little more leisurely and deliberate about it these days.)

Just please don't send me to room 101 for my indoctrination. I
actually like all the salmon, but I don't care for rats. Or
stool pigeons.

Same damn thing. 

I want the rulers to stop ruling, so people can learn how to rule
themselves. You want to keep them "helpless-minded like children"
(as you once asserted most people already are) so you can inculcate
them with your Values, which are, after all, Correct.

     I've always thought a pretty good test of intelligence was to ask 
     someone what they would do with $X, and keeping increasing the value of 
     X until they can't think of anything else to do with it, except buy 50 
     Rolls Royce's (as a certain guru did not long ago). I suspect most 
     people on this list wouldn't have any trouble finding sensible ways to 
     spend their first trillion dollars.
     
     My addition/clarification to that:
     
     First off, thanks Max for instilling a measure of vision and nobility 
     into a topic and about which I started getting my ire up.
     
     I would like to add that although the notion of "plenty" may be a 
     non-issue for some extropians, it is not necessarily a measure of a 
     person's worthiness or intellect that s/he settles for substantially 
     less.  Rather, it is a limitation of his/her imagination and to that 
     extent, those with loftier aspirations should graciously allow them to 
     be or inspire them further.
     
     Although I don't scrutinously follow Bill Gates' entrepreneurial or 
     philanthropic efforts, it is hard not to regard him ultimately as 
     short-sighted and somewhat facist, given the incredibly and 
     precedent-setting resources he has amassed.  
     
     I think the mental exercise of what to do with a trillion dollars 
     could ultimately end up chasing its own tail in the paradigm that some 
     of us (including me) imagine, where humans are not auto-driven by 
     greed and acquisition but by vision and a sense of connectivity and 
     purpose.  Motivation by acquisition seems primitive by comparison, 
     rather like giving the dolphin a fish or the chimp a banana if it does 
     a learned task.  Sure it's where we come from, evolutionarily 
     speaking, but where are we headed and how quickly?  Pretty quickly 
     considering the global neural network expansion and explosion of 
     technological innovation.
     
     And where are we headed?
     
     In Star Trek: First Contact, Picard and the 21st century character, 
     Lily have a discussion about the enormous cost of titanium to build a 
     ship the size of the Enterprise.  It was so encouraging to hear Picard

Ah, another person angry that he's ahead in the game of dying with the
most toys. I see it differently. It has taken his strict control of that
much capital to make the impact Microsoft has had in our world, so
anyone wanting to make a bigger dent in history, better get cracking.
$35 billion still isn't much when you measure how much the government
wastes every year. They've got a $2.5 trillion ANNUAL budget, while that
$35 billion is his entire net worth, not his annual income. TO date,
Bill Gates has had a greater positive impact on my life in the past 5
years than the US gov't has had in the past 20. Who says capitalism
doesn't do it better, cheaper?

I always hated him for making the capitalist Ferrenghi such ugly
dispicable characters, as if to purposely portray anyone with a profit
motive as twisted and beneath contempt (at the time I was starting up my
first business).

Depends on whether Lockheed has made any progress on an Alcubierre type
warp drive with the help of Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff. Anyone heard
anything?

With the replicator technology, which transforms energy into matter and
back in whatever complexity desired, cost of fabrication then would be
much less than now. We couldn't do it today for $100 trillion. Being
over 1000 feet long, we are talking about a spaceship at least twice the
tonnage of our Enterprise class aircraft carriers, being built in space.
We have yet to put even that much raw mass in orbit, never mind build a
starship.

I think the term "scarce" is distracting.  Like in "post-scarcity."
Try this: Nothing will be more easy or difficult, valuable or valueless,
to these beings.  That's what not caring about economy is.

Reminds me of the oatmeal definition of hell.

I love etymology.

Luddites were the friends of Ned Ludd, right?
So, after that, "neo-Luddites" *might* have been used to mean,
"anybody who hates tech like the Luddites did," right?
And then the "neo" got dropped because "Luddite" by itself meant
was sufficient?

Only I don't think that's how it went.  People didn't used to love adding
"neo" to words.

So it was more like, there were the original Luddites, then people
stretched the term to mean tech-haters in general.

And for generations that's what "Luddites" has meant.

But recently, (say since 1990? 1985?)  there has been A NEW CROP.
Or, a crop middle-aged writers have given anti-tech a new push.

I forget these esteemed ones' names at the moment, but the term
"Neo-Luddites" refers to this recent crop, not tech-haters in general.
What they're doing that's considered fresh or new I'm not sure,
maybe it's just having the audacity to write screeds against tech on
Ms. Word 6 instead of the electric typewriters the previous generation
used.

Or maybe this coinage is older than I thought, but always having that
implication of "oh no, *more* of them!?"  Dope springs eternal, especially
around both sides of binary-choice "issues".

As I understand it (*yawn* mmm, a nap would be *nice* right now),

Subject: anti-spam?
Date: Tuesday, June 24, 1997 10:59 PM

I just received another spam - the guys are suggesting me to
send bulk email to 80,000 people for $50.  Spam to distribute spams.
They give their snail-mail address and a reply form that I should
send in with a check.  This is a frequently used technique that
allows spammers to avoid receiving e-mail bombs and to be able
to easily sort the replies.

Now, what if I go for it, and send out a message suggesting people
next time they get a spam with a snail-mail, to mail envelopes to the
spammer's address, containing hate notes, pieces of all kinds of dirty,
smelly, poisonous, explosive, and illegal substances, and everything
else distracting, dangerous, and unpleasant that people can think of?

Could such an "anti-spam spam" help generate enough "negative feedback"
for the spammers to stop asking for snail-mail replies?  That may make
things much more difficult for them.

This suggestion doesn't require adoption of any general standards or laws.

Dear Alexander and other fellow Extropians,

The offer you received appears at first instance to be a violation of
several existing laws.

The Attorneys General of the various states, the FTC, the SEC, the Postal
Inspector and various other agencies have a task force in place to handle
such "spam" using both criminal and civil statutes.

You may wish to print out the offer and send a copy to the Attorney
General in your state.

In most states "spam" complaints are being handled by the consumer frauds
bureau or unit in the AG's office.

If you are aware of the point of origin of the spam send it to the state
where it is originating in.

For further information contact me.

Best wishes,

A.M. Genen

You're *right next* to the point I was trying to make, esteemed sir.

I was trying to point out that "attention" and "time" might still be in
limited supply.

Apart from that, we appear to be in violent agreement. "In a universe in
which anything can happen, who the hell cares what does?"--Theodore Sturgeon

Good question. Most anarchists, myself included, think that defense against 
unfriendly nations is the single most difficult problem of all to answer. 
Of course, we wouldn't need to worry about an invading country if countries 
no longer existed, but as you point out, nation states are unlikely to die at 
the same time.

There is no point in denying it, we will need to protect ourselves, when 
nations start to undergo death convulsions some may become downright nasty.  
Protection costs money, I estimate it would take about 1/8 what an American  
citizen now pay in taxes for defense to protect the continental USA. About 
half of the defense budget involves defending third parties in Europe, Japan, 
Australia etc for free, it takes government twice as much to do anything than 
anybody else and the army is about twice as big as it needs to be. That's 
about  1/40 of the what the US government extorts from taxes, remember the 
complete defense budget is only  about a fifth of  the total budget. That's 
still a lot of money, where will it come from? 

Every year people give billions of dollars to charities even though they gain 
no advantage from it. They also pay billions of dollars in tips, they don't 
have to but they do it because they think it's the right thing to do. I don't 
think it's crazy to say that they would do the  same thing for defense, 
especially since unlike charity and tipping it would help them directly.
Perhaps additional money could come from offering protection services to 
other countries for a price. 

How can I guarantee that this voluntary army won't switch from being a 
protector to being an oppressor? I can't. I can't give you an iron clad  
guarantee that the US Army wont overthrow the government and set up a  
military dictatorship either. They certainly have the means to do so if they  
wished to. I don't think that's very likely to happen, but it's far more 
likely than the sort of army I'm talking about doing it. The instant a
voluntary army starts acting in a totalitarian way, shut off it's money 
supply and stop its cancerous growth in the bud. That is a powerful tool that 
we don't have today, with the US. Army you are forced to keep sending it 
money even if you hate what it's doing.

John Blanco-Losada commented:

Sorry, but I can't let you off so easily.

1) Legislators and their staffs are paid from funds which are coerced by 
the taxpayers.  So the very act of legislating, as it is currently 
practiced in most locations, has everything to do with coercion and would 
be impossible _without_ coercion.  (Obviously this does does not include 
legislators who work for free, or who are funded [legally] from other 
non-coercive sources, but I'm not aware that such people exist.)

2) In the United States, the Executive branch is prohibited  by the 
Constitution from making laws.  Therefore, if legislators didn't write 
laws, bureaucrats wouldn't have regulations to enforce.  So again, 
legislators play a crucial role in the coercive cycle of politics.

legitimate form of coercion and whether it follows that all forms of
governmental action are therefore based on coercion.

The concept as stated seems far to simplistic to dignify except through
sophistry, and ignores the numerous -- and real -- contingency factors that
exist in the formulating policy and applying these contingencies to the
legislative process. 

The contingency factors I refer to are the inputs involved in formulating
policy from the various interest groups. In many instances these interest
groups have legitimate needs. 

Obviously, some interest groups are wholly self serving and have no
interests beyond their own selfish needs. In these instances a
counteractive filtering process takes place to take as many non-considered
factors under advisement in order to provide greater equity in the
formulation of a policy. Indeed, this does not always work the way we would
like. 

No system is perfect. The object is to keep as open a mind as is possible
and encourage the development of an ever greater paradigm that can be
applied to the betterment of the human condition. Within such a framework
all things can be considered and integrated to the extent that they have a
constructive effect on an increasingly literate and slowly evolving
society.

A.M. Genen

I've been getting bounce messages from the list all day when I tried to
post; for some reason mail goes via pobox.com (I presume that it couldn't
connect to extropy.org and was falling back to the MX machines listed in
the DNS record) and that was refusing to forward mail. Was this just a
temporary problem, or do you need to fix the mail forwarding setup?

If it's impossible, then the market will find a way to simplify matters. 
Most likely many organisations will agree to common standards just as they
do on the Net, because it simplifies arrangements for all of them. 
However, unlike current monopoly law anyone who values their freedom over
corporate convenience will be able to choose an alternate legal system
which doesn't use those standards. They will just have to pay more and
accept the inconvenience.

No. See above; the IETF is not a government, since anyone can choose to
run their own network protocol rather that TCP/IP. Their only "punishment"
is that they will be unable to communicate with anyone who does follow the
standard. The Internet is a good example of an anarchy, with each ISP
having its own 'private legal system' (i.e. usage policy) and 'private
protection agency' (e.g. blocking known spamming sites to protect the
users from unwanted junk-mail). Most of its deficiencies are the result of
government coercion (e.g. cryptography patents and export laws preventing
widespread use of cryptographic privacy and authentication). 

> Contracts is a sticky business. Without an established law of contracts,

Then all you need do is agree to use the current contract law. If monopoly
government is as good as you imagine, then people will freely choose it
over private alternatives. Of course, people could break that initial
agreement to abide by that law, but then no-one will ever make another
contract with them and they'll be an outlaw. Not a good idea. 

Another possibility is to use escrow agents to hold a fine which will be 
paid in the event that one party breaks the contract. Then neither side 
has an incentive to do so.

I seem to have missed the contract which governs the current value of
currencies. Personally I thought it was simply the current price on
the exchange markets.

No-one will buy them from him. This is the way currency markets work.

Yes, why should only big governments have nukes? I'd certainly want to
sign up with a nuclear-armed protection agency if I had the choice; I
don't see that they could protect against any remaining governments
otherwise. Of course I'd like to have my own nuke too, but I very much
doubt I could afford one.

Perhaps you should also read 'Basement Nukes' (Erwin Strauss, Loompanics
Unlimited). There are some technical inaccuracies in the bomb designs but
I found the basic political ideas very interesting.

> But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four years

Unfortunately in real life the next idiot normally makes it worse, and
with a government there's no way I can stop them. If an idiot takes over
my PPL I simply choose another and they go bust.

> So eventually the 49%

Uh, no... the 49% become 40%, then 4%, then 0.004% as the 51% kill them
off. The 51% have the US armed forces to back them, and the 49% will have
a hard time defeating them. And in a democracy the more that die the less
chance they have of changing things.

Shame about all the people who get screwed over in the meantime, while
the government maintains your convenient lifestyle.
 
> So I should spend everything I have to avoid being killed? How is this

Because the government will take a 100% income tax and then kill you
anyway. Of course buying a gun costs much less than 100% of your
income, and few people will try to kill you if you have any reasonable
chance of killing them in the process. A larger group can buy a few
nukes; do you think the Nazis would have tried to kill the Jews if they
were nuclear-armed? Hmm, now there's an idea for an SF story...

What did you think I was saying? 

I feel that you have entirely missed my point. Any law/statute -- no
matter how it was achieved -- is not a law unless it is enforced. You
need not be in law school to know that law enforcement is by definition
coercion. Or more simply, "Follow this rule or else!"

Okay, this bugs me. Whether a nation-state exists or not, don't you

Do you think that that war is over forever once these death convulsions

Okay, this is more than I know, but I have to ask, does any
self-interested government do anything for free? I in particular feel
that nothing benevolent is done without an ulterior motive, conscious or
unconscious.

Newton considered absolute space to be 'the Sensorium of God.

The 'Sensoriom' is the space within which we visualize images, and create 
an approximately accurate representation of the world frtom sense-data.

Children can visualize images 'out there' (projectively).

Karl Popper's classification goes like this:

World One:  The world of objective physical reality.

World Tro:  The world of subjective experience:

World Three:  The world of externally-represented objective knowledge.

We, as living selves, interact beween these three worlds.

See Karl Popper and John Eccles: 'The Self and its Brain." Springer [1977]

There is another inclusion (for non-robotic humans):

World Four: "We are all sparks of the eternal flame."

Hmm, diamond can probably stand around 4000K, although nanodevices
likely break down at 1000K (judging from the NASA simulations). The
temperature of a blackbody sphere is T=(E/(4 pi r^2 sigma))^1/4
where E is the energy output of the sun, r is the radius and sigma
the constant of the the Stefan-Boltzman's law. 

Putting 4000K into the equation, we get 1.48e9 meters, or around 1.4
million kilometers. For 1000K we get a radius of 2.37e10 meters, or
around 23 million kilometers. This is roughly 2 and 32 solar radii
respectively.

The laser idea probably won't work thermodynamically, you must get
rid of entropy, not just energy.

Sounds possible in principle, but I think the corona is too thin to
be a good coolant.

The Microsoft Empire was founded on a deliberately crippled platform 
(the IBM-PC, which was designed not to impact on IBM's mini- and 
mainframe sales)).

Microsoft took over a crippled Operating System which had been clumsily 
ripped off from CP/M by people with nothing like the skills of Gary 
Kildall and his team at Digital Research.

IBM couldn't do a deal with Digital Reasearch, for reasons which bear 
looking into, and because Kildall didn't want to downgrade his fine 
product, which was the foundation of Personal Computing.

So here we are, with Wintel foisting an absurd and costly system which 
locks up and falls over from time to time, on the entire world.  There are 
few misguided but influential people in parts of the US Government who 
cooperate with Microsoft, because (according to James Adams, writing in 
the Sunday Times), there are 'back doors' and latent viruses embedded in 
the software.

These can be remotely activated while you're online, and data packets 
inserted into the data stream to activate subroutines which scan your hard 
disk, and send the whole directories strucure to somewhere else by means 
of interleave data packets with _different address destination headers_.

On your next logon, they can pick selected files straight off your hard 
drive.  Think about it: they may have done this already, if you're 
'interesting' enough.


Any half-way competent foreign signals intelligent outfit knowing how to 
do this (a totalitarian dictatership elsewhere in the world, ferinstance) 
can ransack the hard drives of any American who browses the Web via 
Windows95.

This, according to intelligence expert James  Adams (writing recently in 
the 'Sunday Times').  Many other people are discussing it, too. The Windoze 
'bloatware' makes them a bit difficult to spot, but they're there all 
right.


This cannot possibly be in accordannce with the very explicit Mission 
Statement of the National Security Agency, which is charged with 
protecting the interests of _all_ American citizens, not just Bill Gates.

All NSA staffers are sworn to uphold the American Constitution, and all 
the rights it guarantees to all Americans.

There are much better, cheaper alternatives to Wndoze around right now,

And other goodies too.

They will be so cheap that an ISP or telco will _give_ you a basic 
Blackbird.  They're based on the Motorola micocessor range, and Bill Gates 
(or any half-witted deputy) won't know what hit him if they try to screw 
Motorola around.  They're a fully-fledged major defense contractor, with a 
global data-radio going up soon -- 'Iridium.'

Better yet, the 'Blackbird' DSP technology means you can _download_ the 
latest SofmMdem software -- including spread-spectrum datastreams wich 
are far faster and more error-resistant than what most of you use at the 
moment. The telcos will be more than willing to let you 'blink' on and off 
the Web during your seesions -- it reduces the load on their systems.

The present value of a new ISP client to an ISP provider in America is 
around $1200.  They can afford to _give_ customers a basic Blackbird, 
which wil 'retail' at arounf $500.  Not much Bill Gates can do about that, 
unless he wants to start killing everyone... >:-}

Don't complain about 'advertizing': -- to the customers, Blackbirds can be 
_free_.  Some people will complain about anything, of course.

The more _UNaffordable_ these  lightning-fast personal computers were, the 
more we would see a 'verticalist' hierarchical society of priviledge, 
where only the better-off can participate in the Information Revolution 
and the 'Warp-Speed' transformation of the world's econmy.  Oh, and the 
world's societies, too.

Spontaneous Orders are horizontalist and equalitarian.

The choice has to be obvious to any genuine Hayekian who is not using

Rodenberry has always been an outright socialist, so that's no
surprize.  They did, however, partially redeem themselves in an
episode of DS9 when Quark and Cisco were discussing Ferengi culture.
Cisco was being particularly nasty about it, and Quark reminded him
that Earth had Wars, Famines, Slavery, and atrocities that Ferengi
never had time for...too busy making money.  Glad some writer
managed to sneak that one in.

The topic was money.  The word "enough" is certainly useful when
talking about things that can be satiated, like food or sex, or
things that have physical limits (the speed of light is fast enough).
But when the subject is money, I continue to assert that "enough"
cannot be meaningfully applied, because money is by definition that
which one uses to satisfy one's goals, and there is no limit to
goals except failure of imagination.

I answered the questions put honestly, meaningfully, and with some
effort put into the ideas and wording.  If you think otherwise,
then please provide evidence or refrain from making baseless
accusations.  If you want to attack the ideas, I welcome that,
but to attack my motives shows that your reasoning is too weak to
stand on its own.

I believe that coercion is immoral.  So as far as I am concerned, asking 
whether our tax system is a "legitimate form of coercion" is oxymoronic.  
While this is indeed a simplistic  premise, it works for me and forms the 
basis of much of my philosophical and political viewpoint.

So perhaps we'll just agree to disagree on this basic point.

>The contingency factors I refer to are the inputs involved in formulating

I believe that _I_ have legitimate needs.  Does that make it right for me 
to force you to pay for these needs?  Adding a middleman in the form of a 
legislator or a bureaucrat who serves only to compel you to pay me should 
have no effect on the basic morality or immorality of this question.

>Obviously, some interest groups are wholly self serving and have no
>interests beyond their own selfish needs.

Actually, I think it could be argued that _all_ interest groups are 
wholly self-serving, since by definition an interest group is a 
collection of individuals who unite around a common set of beliefs and 
attempt to cause change in a direction consistent with those beliefs.

So you admit that the legislator applies his own perceptions, beliefs, 
and biases to the requests of these groups, and makes judgements of the 
worthiness of their claims based on his opinions?  How can he possibly 
know their needs better than they do?  The fact that things don't always 
work out "the way we would like" only serves to illustrate that none of 
us, not even the legislator, is omniscient.  Quite often, we do not even 
posesses complete information about the particular issue at hand.  But 
until we develop a reliable method of mind-reading, the only person who 
knows what a particular person values and needs is that particular 
person.  Which is why I believe that an anarcho-capitalistic, free-market 
system, which leaves each person free to conduct transactions based 
solely on his or her values and needs, is currently the optimal 
political/economic arrangement.

I agree with you.  (I don't want to be completely contrary!)

I'm not sure what you specifically have in mind here.  But I can't think 
of an arrangement which is more open-minded, and which leaves people more 
free to develop and better themselves, than the free market.  Admittedly 
such an arrangement can't be controlled, or its results predicted, but as 
you've already admitted, the same is true for the "democratic" system in 
which we currently live and which you seem to advocate.

FOr a being that can live forever, or split hairs at the nanosecond

However, we all have a sort of parabolic scale we apply to any activity
indicating our willingness to do the work related to our relative need
at the time, the amount being paid, and the amount of risk or drudgery
the work entails. For each of use there is a point along our axis of
personal wealth where you couldn't get us to do anything we weren't
intererested in for any amount of money. I imagine that the people on
this list could be gotten to do things they were interested in, but
there are plenty of drones in society who have points where they would
not want to do ANYTHING.

We haven't had time.  We've spent the last 5000 years cleaning up all the
grasslands and most of the temperate forests.  We're cleaning up the rain
forests right now.  In the next few hundred years, we'll clean up the rest

The minumum distance is around 136 kilometers [not a typo!].  Allow me to

<p>The surface of the Sun is hotter than the boiling point of any known 
material.  Indeed, it is hot enough to rip any known molecule into atoms.  
One might think this would preclude the direct exploration and 
exploitation of the Sun.  However, this is not the case.  It

the atmosphere of the Sun.  This can be done with plausible near-term 
technology, operating with known materials and entirely within the

<p>I call my design for such a device a <i>heliopter</i> (from the Greek

a power source.  

<p>First I will discuss the environment of the solar atmosphere.  This is 
well-established science.  Then I will discuss how one might keep an 
object immersed in that atmosphere cold enough to remain solid.  This is 
an application of well-established engineering thermodynamics.  Finally, I 
will describe the heliopter as a whole.  This is an excercise in wild-ass 
system engineering.  There's nothing in the design that I know to be 
infeasible, but I certainly haven't worked out every stress and heat flux 
and confirmed that it will work.

You'll get to see the rest of this essay once I calculate some more, and
maybe draw a picture or two.  Provided I don't decide to first finish my
essays on re-engineering the human body or burning down the Sun...

Blackbody radiation over the largest possible area is the most efficient way
of getting rid of heat.  All other methods of heat disposal will leave less
energy available for useful purposes.  

Lasing in particular is very bad.  You wouldn't know it to look at one, but
laser beams are very cold, i.e. have very low entropy.  Thermodynamically
speaking, they're like a perfect crystal at very low temperature, and the
process of producing one requires extracting lots of entropy from a lasing
medium and dumping it in the environment.  Trying to cool something by
emitting a laser beam is like trying to cool your house by installing a
powerful freezer, making lots of ice cubes, and throwing them out the
window.  (Hmmm... that has a certain surreal delight to it.  Imagine a house
with ice cubes flying out all the windows...)

Yes, but (as others have already pointed out) that's impossible, so it's

Diamonds are not durable even under moderately high temperatures 
and can revert back to carbon froms at 1000C to 2000C depending on 
environmental conditions.

is a wonderful material that allows you to make loaded bearings

Will this energy be utilized as heat to run a turbine, do 
that standard p-n junction like photovoltaics or high temperature 
based thermionics for electricity?

There is an engineer that has conducted an experiment that actually 
successfully used a 40 watt laser to cool a crystal in a surprising way.  
As a matter of fact, the paper on the technique is something else to read.

> That's OK, I love giving answers. -- CarlF

A distant laser beam could potentially provide a remote cooling source to 
optically relocate the entropy of the heliopter while it is very close to 
the atmosphere of the Sun.  The radiator would appear as black, but 
actually could be reflective to the optical coupling to the remote 
cooling laser array.  Phase cooling is also valuable for nano-technology, 
silicon semiconductor fabrication and in vacuum object thermal shunting.

There is an engineer that has conducted an experiment that actually 
successfully used a 40 watt laser to cool a crystal in a surprising way.  
As a matter of fact, the paper on the technique is something else to read.

A distant laser beam could potentially provide a remote cooling source to 
optically relocate the entropy of the heliopter while it is very close to 
the atmosphere of the Sun.  The radiator would appear as black, but 
actually could be reflective to the optical coupling to the remote 
cooling laser array.  Phase cooling is also valuable for nano-technology, 
silicon semiconductor fabrication and in vacuum object thermal shunting.

Presumably this is one of the Icelandic ones? Does anyone know where I can
find them; are they available in English on the Net or in print? If the
latter, then publication details would be appreciated.

To you. Ask the entity. Me, I am guessing that such an entity will still
have priorities and preferences. Unless those fall out as "natural laws",
or unless the entity can recycle time, my guess is that sooner or later
such entity will encounter time crunches.

Of course, I can't prove it... And that still leaves "attention".

Whatever the hell *that* is. ;/ :)

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Lee Daniel Crocker asserted:

There is no such thing as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingle=
ss abstractions.

Rick Knight replied:
*Enough* is when you aren't devoting energy to a particular goal or
desire.  As in full or satiated.

*Plenty* is when you can comfortably/benevolently redirect your fo=
cus and consider the needs/desires of others or embellish/expand your 
own. As in comfort or even abundance.

I have applied meaning to your absolutist assertion of no meaning =
and request that you devote a modicum of time/energy to address Mr. Wiser's 
question with some respect and consideration.  Otherwise, =
it would be more beneficial to simply refrain because credibility expressed 
in the motif you've chosen is seriously lacking.

Daniel then countered:

The topic was money.  The word "enough" is certainly useful when
talking about things that can be satiated, like food or sex, or
things that have physical limits (the speed of light is fast enough).
But when the subject is money, I continue to assert that "enough"
cannot be meaningfully applied, because money is by definition that
which one uses to satisfy one's goals, and there is no limit to
goals except failure of imagination.

Rick>> The last statement I concur with.  My definitions of enough and 
plenty served as a countermeasure to a proliferation of sentiments of what 
appear to be avarice and self-centered notions (not on your part, per se, 
more a theme that runs with this list).  

Daniel>> I answered the questions put honestly, meaningfully, and with some 
effort put into the ideas and wording.  If you think otherwise,
then please provide evidence or refrain from making baseless
accusations.  

Rick>> "accusations" is a meaning you ascribe.  The tone of your reply to 
Mr. Wiser I *interpret* to be abstract and terse and he has rephrased his 
query in the latest digest.  Hopefully, his revision will engage even more 
honest and meaningful responses because I regard it to be an intriguing 
mental exercise.  

I have no quarrel with you and certainly am not going to expend anymore 
energy digging into the semantics to cite precisely where you ran aground 
in my opinion.  Take it on that you just might be perceived with a less 
than congenial attitude in this driest-of-dry communication mediums.  My 
opinion is not the truth. I won't come and conviscate your computer for 
perceived impoliteness. <G> I disagree with the absolutist assertion that 
*enough money* is meaningless.  Of course, I also envision a world beyond 
the market economy paradigm.  

IMHO, money still represents a notion of clinging to a survivalist and 
individualist mentality and as long as it serves as the medium for one 
person having more than another, mimicking natural selection while we, the 
privileged species with the opposable thumbs and the developed brain stems 
shrug it off as okay (pause, breath)...as long as it is equated with the 
"natural order of things", we are relegated to a world of material-based 
angst.  Extropian or not, that's hardly an ideal world and I want more.  
Perhaps I should classify myself as a Extro-Utopian <G>.

Daniel>> If you want to attack the ideas, I welcome that, but to attack my 
motives shows that your reasoning is too weak to stand on its own.

Rick>> Curious tactic but I respectfully decline.  I think we can put this 
one to bed and move on to more intriguing banter...as long as you're clear 
I'm just another harmless guy on a chatty and pontifical digest espousing 
anything and everything because it's an amusing distraction and (at times) 
an engaging mental exercise.

Hagbard so-called Celine cautions us against anarchy:

A person with the power to tax, to conscript armies, and generally
to shift the consequences of his actions onto innocent peasants --
okay, got it.  I'm not convinced that this analogy fits my neighbors
well enough to model how they'd behave in anarchy.

	>The history of international relations until WWI is a study in

(What has changed since 1914?)

The history of humanity is a tale of wars because statists write the
history books, and to statists, activity other than war is ignoble.
I prefer to see the history of humanity as a tale of trade and invention.

had outlived his usefulness.  Has the new idiot given any sign of repudiating 
such adventures?

The response is quite inappropriate.

I took political advice on publishing it from the President of the Adam

  In case you missed the earlier episodes (as I did), here are listings of
future showings in the EASTERN and the PACIFIC time zones, for the next two
weeks.  Note that these different local times are actually the same
Universal Coordinated Time (~GMT) times.  The CENTRAL and MOUNTAIN times
may be interpolated from these two zone schedules.

  Such schedules (for the major 4 U.S. time zones and the major cable
services) are available from 
http://www.tmstv.com/ or 
http://www.tmstv.com/cgi-bin/tvcgi.cnn/, among others.  They can be
generated for a week before the present to two weeks in advance.

  LEARN or TLC is The Learning Channel, which will be on a specific
numbered channel on your cable system, if you get it.  The times of
cablecast will be the same.

No. Anything which has uniqueness can be seen as 'cultish'. I'm for
calling a spade a spade, and an extropian and extropian. Changing our
image to satisfy some ideal of acceptability is a well trodden path to
the terminally bland.

If the goal is behavorial change, punishment is not a very effective way
to accomplish that. The goals of the justice system have little to do
with behavorial change however.

	It is true that there may be various phenomenal qualities to
the infinite amount of possible physical representation methods
employed by various computing devices that we have not yet understood
how to directly observe or for which we don't yet really know what it
is "like".  But, we can know that even if such phenomenal qualities do
exist they are irrelevant by the vary definition of an abstract
representation.  It doesn't matter to the abstract intelligences that
we currently produce whether the representation is punched on paper
tape or stored in high speed volatile transistor arrays.  What the
fundamental nature of the representation is like is not relevant to
the particular information being represented in such a machine.  This
is very different than us.  If you completely rewire an abstract
computer so that what once physically represented red now represents
blue and visa versa, there would be no difference in behavior of the
machine.  The abstract machine would not know the difference.  This is
the definition of abstract knowledge.

	But, if you did the same thing in the optic nerve of a human
so that it now used a red quale to represent blue wavelengths of light
and visa versa, his favorite color quale would still likely be the
same sensation which would now represent a different wavelength of
light.  What the world would be phenomenally "like" to him would be
drastically different after such a change.  His answer to what red and
blue were like would become inverted.  The abstract intelligence
wouldn't know how to answer such a "what is it like" question, unless
it was abstractly programmed to lie about it.

	You are right, we are trapped inside our own little spirit
world and can't YET know, other than abstractly, the phenomenal nature
of anything beyond our skull.  Philosophers call this "the veil of
perception." Our senses only know abstractly what the world is like.
But, this will not always be the case.  When we finally objectively
discover what and why these fundamental qualities of our conscious
representation are we will eventually be able to pierce and escape
this mortal spiritual veil and we will be able to know more than
simply the fundamental and/or phenomenal qualities of abstract
representations aren't relevant to what is being represented.  We will
be able to endow machines with the ability to have more than abstract
knowledge.  "Oh THAT's what salt tastes like!"  they will eventually
be able to honestly say after being properly endowed.

     the word static from the digest.  No more =20 and jagged formatting.  
     It was very enjoyable to skim through the posts!  Was it on the

     wee hours accomplishing the little things that maybe no one would even 
     notice or appreciate?

Sounds intriguing! Although I suppose we need some marginals to deal

Is there any good way of proving this? I'm constantly finding myself
bumping into thermodynamics (which I have not studied much) when I
want to do megaengineering.

Ah, true, but I thought you were referring to top speed acheived, not
airspeed. As for airspeed, there really isn't any point going above Mach
3-6 unless you are either going into orbit or a ballistic trajectory,
and impossible to go over orbital velocity (Mach 25) unless you plan on
going into space. Given that aerospace planes are in the near future
(5-15 years), this will give us 45 minute flight times to any point on
earth, which will be the practical limit until someone invents
teleportation, if they can. I think that these two reference points keep
us on the curve, don't you?

The legal definition of actual libel hold that one condition be that the
libeler commited the libel with actual malice. Does a corporation have

Yes, but a) nation-states can go to war much more easily than anarchies,
because they can readily round up their population and send them off to
fight and b) individual anarchists or small groups have access to any
weapons they desire, so wars between anarchists are less likely, or are
likely to be fatal to both sides.

No government ever does anything for free. They just steal the money from 
us to pay for it.

You might want to add Vernor Vinge's short story 'The Ungoverned' to the
reading list, as it's a fairly good rendering of a war between a
Friedman-style anarchy and a nation state.

I don't see that it would have much effect, since the spammers don't pay
for it... sure, they have to sort out the junk, but they can hire a few
minimum wage workers for that. You'll pay far more to send them the
snail-mail than they'll pay to sort it. 

Personally, as much as I dislike spam I'm no longer too concerned about
it. I now have some pretty sophisticated mail-filtering software on my
account which has at least a 90% success rate, and the few messages which
get through *might* not be 'real' spam (i.e. they're sent directly to me
and have at least *some* relation to the things I have on my Web site). 

So from my point of view it's merely forced me to develop some software
which I really should have done ages ago, and which in future I can
probably extend to delete mailing list messages which I'm probably not
going to be interested in. As more and more people start to use this kind
of software spam will slowly disappear, or they'll have to give us an
incentive to read it, such as including an ecash payment with the message. 
That's the only way to really stop the spammers; develop technology so
that spamming simply doesn't work. 

In case anyone's interested, I'm basically using the following procedure: 

	Always pass PGP-encrypted or PGP-signed mail (since I can 
		eventually update that to pass or block based on PGP 
		keys)
	Always pass mail from my friends and mailing lists (of course
		the header could be faked, but few spammers would go
		that far; and I haven't seen enough spam posted to the 
		lists to worry about scanning for it)
	Autodelete anything sent from known spam sites
	Autodelete anything with some magic words in the header
		(e.g. known spammers IP addresses)
	Count the number of magic words (e.g. 'MLM', 'Make Money') in the 
		message subject and body, and increase the count if the 
		message isn't sent directly to me or in various other 
		circumstances. If the count is over one limit then it's 
		saved to a spam folder which I clear out every few weeks, 
		and if it's over a higher limit the message is just deleted.

So far I've had no false positives for deletion and <1% false positives
for the spam folder, and the extra overhead is only a fraction of a second
per message; since the processing is all done on the ISP I also don't have
to worry about the cost of downloading the extra mail to process it
locally (e.g. last year most of my Net access was through Internet Cafes).
I'd really like to make the content analysis more sophisticated, but I'm
not sure where to look for information on text analysis. Any suggestions?

Now that the CDA has been defeated in the Supreme Court, pundits are 
focusing on user-education and self-filtering programs.  PICS has been 
mentioned as an up and coming standard for user-filtration.  However, 
WIRED has mentioned that PICS could be used by anybody to censor others 
without their knowledge or consent.

Is this going to be a problem?  And can anybody explain to me how this 
could be done?  And most importantly since this a technical form of 
censorship, is there a technical way around it?

Well, that's not entirely true; you could go into a forced orbit at lower
altitude by using a second engine thrusting upwards to provide the
required force. However, you'd certainly have problems with frictional
heating and fuel consumption.

If that was possible, then the ideal might be around Mach 50 high in the
atmosphere, or in 'low orbit'; in inverted flight you'd feel about 1g
towards the floor of the vehicle, so the only unusual aspect would be
seeing the ground 'above' you.

P.S. Arthur C Clarke wrote an article about this decades ago, but I've 
forgotten the name or which of his books it appears in.

Dear Extropian List Reader,

Tonight, I will be posting the following Prometheus Project update to
CryoNet, sci.cryonics, and sci.life-extension. I am posting it here,
since this is an important announcement and many of you do not read
CryoNet.


Prometheus Project Update

Two major developments have taken place since my last report
on the Prometheus Project. First, a $10,000 per year pledge has been
received from Walter De Brouwer of Belgium who wrote:

>We have done our best to publicize your research programme and due to
>our good reputation in research I have been offered a board seat on the
>Visionary Research Funding Committee of the European Commission.  That
>is where I could take this further (although I encountered a lot of
>unbelief and scepticism already).  
>Now I want my company to make a pledge of 10,000 $/year.

In a reply to my thank-you note, Walter wrote:

>If you are ever in the neighbourhood of our countries (or anyone from
>prometheus) we'll set something up to introduce them to the right >people.

The second major development is the offer of $100,000 in immediate
research funding plus the use of a laboratory, its equipment (including
3 electron microscopes), and access to specialized testing and analysis
in other labs as necessary. The lab facilites being offered are located
in a major university medical center and the person (a cryonicist
medical doctor) offering this package is the Head of Pathology at that
center. A dialogue between this person and a well known cryobiologist is
in progress which aims to develop research plans for a pilot project to
begin prior to the achievement of the Prometheus Project's targeted
pledge total. Several months ago, there was a proposal and discussion on
the Prometheus pledgers forum about the possibility of such a pilot
project and several pledgers indicated, at that time, that they would be
willing to commit their pledge funds early toward such a pilot project. 
It is hoped that such a project will show that the Prometheus Project
is  "really" going to happen, and, as a consequence, accelerate the
achievement of its goals.

In addition, pledges were received from:

Doug Platt for $500 per year to join with someone else who is pledging a
like amount;

Brook Norton for $1000 per year who wrote: "I'm glad to be of some help
on this project and thank you for your tremendous effort to make
Prometheus happen"; 

and two pledgers who wanted to remain anonymous. The first, who pledged
$1000 per year wrote: "Good luck and kudos on your persistence". The
second for $2000 per year came just two days ago.

Many thanks to these new pledgers for emphasizing their concern for
conserving life through support of the Project. Naturally, I am
delighted with these events and will keep readers posted about further
developments.

Funding Statistics

There are now 82 pledges with total value $384,600 per year for ten
years.

Number of pledges for each yearly dollar amount:

           3 for $50,000,
          11 for $10,000,
           1 for  $6,800,
           8 for  $5,000,
           1 for  $4,000,
           1 for  $3,000,
           1 for  $2,500,
           9 for  $2,000,
           5 for  $1,500,
           4 for  $1,200,
          38 for  $1,000.

Yearly pledge totals by national origin:

     Australia                  $5,500
     Belgium                   $10,000 
     Canada                    $27,000
     France                     $2,000
     Germany                    $1,500
     New Zealand                $1,500
     Sweden                     $1,000
     United States            $331,100
     No country                 $5,000

What did you think I was saying? 

I feel that you have entirely missed my point. Any law/statute -- no
matter how it was achieved -- is not a law unless it is enforced. You
need not be in law school to know that law enforcement is by definition
coercion. Or more simply, "Follow this rule or else!"

Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,

Unfortunately, voluntary compliance to most ethical and moral principals is
noted
primarily by its breach.

Can anyone provide me with a viable social alternative to "coercion"???

I just read Atlas Shrugged and I found it quite enjoyable.  Towards the
latter half I was reading over a hundred pages a day (and I have yet to
invest in any sort of speed reading).
On the other hand, I did try to read Thus Spake Zarathrustra and stopped
several pages in...

> to hold some of their extropic ideas.  

	I stumbled across an Extropian website while looking for information on
getting a clock to run from a potato (never did find it...).  I was trying
to at least develop some ideas on how a watch could be installed in
someone's arm but a better idea for that has already been discussed on the
list.
	I've been interested in science fiction for a while, cyborgs especially. 
Libertarian ideas never really interested me much (I did have dreams of
conquering the world...) until I checked out David Friedman's website.  I
then read Machinery of Freedom and I was hooked.  Now I dream of conquering
solar systems, but of ruling nobody.

Would you kill a convict for continuing to insist he's innocent?

I might ad that I don't see how it's changed since then.

I would propose that the situation could be condensed to "if you're

hardly different than toddlers....the only thing preventing a toddler from

I have yet to encounter such a fanatic in daily life.

Also, these fanatics generally (there's that word again) have a goal
other than simple killing.  The Crusaders didn't care about wiping
Islam from the world, just from the Holy Land.  The suicide bombers
of today may have a secret desire to kill all Americans, but they
mainly kill soldiers in Arabia.  And so on.

(How many of the Crusaders went by their own choice, and how many

I agree, except my intelligence has always concluded that all intelligence 
is abstract.  What on earth would non abstract intelligence be like? 
                 

        >This is very different than us.          


I see nothing different in the slightest. You will treat this post much the 
same if you read it off a cathode ray tube, a liquid crystal screen, listen 
to it with a voice synthesizer or print it on a dead tree.

Why? There would be a difference in behavior, unless you change the machine's 
memory of color too.  The relationship of one color to another and how that 
connects to objects in the real world would be different.  The machine once 
said that red, orange and pink were similar, not now. It once thought red and
black neckties looked great, but now they look ugly and he never wares them. 
This rewiring would be just as disconcerting for a intelligent machine as it 
would be for me or you.
                 

        >But if you did the same thing in the optic nerve of a human so that

        >sensation which would now represent a different wavelength of light.          
        

Yes, but why wouldn't the same thing be true of a machine, after all, 
a machine can have a favorite color too.
               

        >What the world would be phenomenally "like" to him would be         
        >drastically different after such a change.  


A red quale in isolation is meaningless, if all light produced a red 
sensation then color would signify nothing. The red color only has meaning 
if there is contrast, if there are other colors that are not red to compare 
it to. If you changed my perception of red and blue today then obviously my 
subjective experience would be different as would be my behavior, just like 
the machine. If you also changed my memory of those colors or made the switch 
the day I was born then my behavior today would be no different, just like 
the machine. You say my subjective experience would be different but give no 
evidence to support your claim.
               

        >His answer to what red and blue were like would become inverted.           


You'll have to take my word for it but I am not a machine, I am a human, 
but I can not answer what the sensations of red and blue are and I'm quite 
sure you can do no better. I can give examples but no definition, I can point 
to red and blue things but that's all. I can't say what red and blue are.

Knowledge is an abstract quantity. Knowledge of anything is abstract.

You don't really think the debate on this issue will EVER come to an end do 
you? OK, it's the year 2525 and you have just thought up a bright shiny new 
theory explaining exactly what subjective experience is all about.  
How do I know if it's even approximately correct?

No you're incorrect, that's not what salt tastes like to me at all, it's not  
even close. Prove I'm right. Prove I'm wrong.
        
Brent Allsop is an intelligent fellow but he is not conscious, in fact, 
all human beings are conscious, except Brent Allsop. Brent has some pitiful 
little thing he calls consciousness, but compared to the glorious subjective 
experience every other human has it's the difference between a firefly and 
a supernova.  Prove I'm right. Prove I'm wrong.

	It could be that stars are simply not an efficient energy source.  Already
humans have hypothesized about energy sources that require new physics. 
Zero point energy comes to mind.  Why would anyone bother surrounding a sun
with a sphere when they could get more energy out of the space contained in
a light bulb?  There could be many more sources of energy in the universe,
and they could be found in a billion years, than stars and if matter is
scarce it would not be economical to surround a star.  If matter is not
scarce, as the state of the universe would show, even the general outlines
of the advanced race defy comprehension.

Freedom of expression does not give one the right to force others to
listen if they don't want to.  A PICS labelling bureau can evaluate
any site by any criteria it wants, and subscribers can choose any
bureau they want and choose to filter on any ratings they want.  That
is not by any stretch of the dictionary "censorship"; it is enabling
the user to make his own choices; after all, his right to listen to
only what he wants is every bit as valid as your right to say what
you want.  I am a free speech radical absolutist, but if you want to
put me in your killfile, I have no right to complain, nor do I have
any right to know that you have done so or why.  A PICS bureau is no
different.  If they choose to label a site "adult", they are under no
obligation to explain, inform, or grant any recourse.  They are only
exercising /their/ free speech to evaluate and label.

I'd like to start a PICS bureau that labelled sites for "cluefulness",
so that users could filter out various levels of idiocy.

Rethinking the Welfare State -- A New CEPR Network

http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety

Rethinking the Welfare Society is a new CEPR network which will analyze the
provision and finance of social insurance, lifecycle transfers,
redistribution,
and welfare services -  such as health care, education, and training - in
advanced market economies. The network seeks to address the challenge of
exploring how the above activities are to be divided between the government,
business enterprises, households, and other economic and political
institutions. Since the government is viewed as just one source of welfare
activities, the network deals with the "welfare society" rather than just the
"welfare state." The network is concerned not only with the sources of
welfare
problems - such as poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, and economic
insecurity - but also with strategies for reforming the incentives and
institutions associated with welfare activities.

We encourage you to join our mailing list which you can do at our website. We
will use this to provide news of upcoming conferences and activities as well
as
for research news. If you are a specialist in one of the areas covered by the
network, you are also encouraged to enter your name in our directory of
specialists http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/wsndir. This can also be done at our
website
http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety. The searchable directory is
intended
as a compendium of information of researchers working in the area. We
particularly welcome your ideas on how to foster on-line communication,
networking in this area.

We look forward to your contributions.

NIPS'97 Postconference Workshop
                ===============================
 
        Can Artificial Cerebellar Models Compete to Control Robots?
 

	http://www.op.dlr.de/FF-DR-RS/CONFERENCES/nips-workshop/
 
Objective:
----------
Recent successes in robotics have broadened the field of application
and acceptation of robots.  Nevertheless, industrial robotics still
has to go a long way.  While the applicability of classical robots
remains limited to factory floors, research lab robotics is moving
towards novel actuators for constructing light-weight, compliant robot
arms.  Hereto actuators are needed which consist of agonist-antagonist
drive pairs for maintaining accurate positioning without recalibration,
as well as for controlling the stiffness of a joint.  However, when
these joints are combined to construct a robot arm, existing
algorithms can only inaccurately control the arm at low velocities.
 
Starting from Albus' model from the 70's, neuro-computational models
of the cerebellum have been advocated as possible candidates for the
control of complex robot systems.  Unfortunately, there have been very
few applications of cerebellar models to the control of real robot
manipulators with at least 6 degrees of freedom.  Cerebellar models
have become more refined through specialised investigations based on
details of the biological cerebellar system, while insufficient
attention has been given to applicability of these refinements in
robotics. In the development of these methodologies, there are few
examples of successful integration of neuro-computational models.
 
In this workshop we want to investigate how neuro-computational models
might be incorporated as a standard part of robotics.  We want to
address two questions: How reasonable is the desire for such an
amalgamation?  What prerequisites are there for having cerebellar
models successfully compete with alternative approaches to control of
real robots?
 
These questions will be addressed through the presentation of papers
which:
  1. describe biologically plausible models of sensory-motor control;
  2. apply cerebellar models to the control of robot manipulators;
  3. describe robot control methodologies that can incorporate
     cerebellar or other neuro-computational model (e.g., vision);
  4. provide a case history illustrating barriers to successful
     competition by cerebellar models for robot control.


Call for Contributions
======================
For the workshop we will be looking for talks and papers which:

* describe research applying cerebellar models to robot
  applications implemented on real robots;

* describe biologically plausible models of
  sensory-motor control;

* describe robot control methodologies that can incorporate
  cerebellar or other neuro-computational model (e.g., vision);

* provide a case history illustrating barriers to successful
  competition by cerebellar models for robot control.

After my work for a year on Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF)
at Firefly, Inc., I wrote an essay on theory of ACF technology, its
potential social consequences and technological successors. You can
find it at   <http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/ACF.html>
There is also a number of references there to various relevant sources.

I do not think we should concentrate on PICS itself, but rather on
the field in general, if we really want to identify technological
promises and threats.

It seems we have a misunderstanding.  I know that the intent of PICS is 
to give the user freedom to filter whatever they want.  And that is not 
my concern.  My point is that I have heard that PICS can be used to 
censor OTHER people!  The idea for PICS came from the concern of parents 
as to what they want their children to view on the net.  Since PICS is 
intended to be built into the infrastructure, it could also be used by 
any third party (such as the chineese government), to censor other 
people from what they can and cannot see.  At least this is what I've 
heard - and thats why I made this post in the first place.

Bobby - PICS can be used to facilitate "censorship" (by many definitions)
if the censor has the power to filter the pages that the user accesses.
China could force users to go through approved proxy servers which would
filter out pages the government didn't like, just as parents could force
their children to use filtering software.  Where along this line you start
calling it censorship will vary from person to person, but obviously it
could make it easier to apply these kinds of restrictions.

More broadly, though, PICS really gives more information about the
data being labelled, and it packages it in a form which makes it easy
to filter.  As with other advances in making data available (like the
net itself), this has good and bad consequences.  Making it easier for
people to filter by themselves inherently makes it easier for people to
filter on behalf of others.  This is analogous to the way in which the
net makes it easier for people to get both "good" and "bad" information,
by whatever definition you use.

My opinion is that blaming PICS for making censorship easier is not
the right way to look at it, blaming the messenger for the message.
The real people at fault are the censors.  They are the ones at whom
criticism or political pressure should be aimed.  A system like PICS
follows in the grand tradition of the net, making more information
available, more conveniently.

Many traditional supporters of free speech on the net are opposed to
PICS, but I think they are being inconsistent.  They oppose restrictions
on access to information, but here is a kind of information which they
don't want to see propagated.  I personally support measures like PICS
which provide more information about what is on the net.  I oppose the
efforts of censors to stop adults from having access to the information
they desire.  Both of these positions seem entirely consistent to me.

Tony, I think you may get a little flak if you try maintaining this
line in this particular forum, unless you do a *lot* of explaining, 
fairly quickly. ;-)

If you're talking a version of Tipplerism (IYSWIM), then maybe, but 
otherwise you'll need to tell us where this differs from mysticism.

I've been a latent extropian for quite a while, and when I was searching
for some info on Rome one day on Alta Vista, one of the links it kicked
back was Romana Machado's home page, which led me here, and I couldn't
be happier....

If you are dealing with just the radiated heat from the 5000 deg
surface, this is true, but the corona (the sun's "atmosphere) has much
higher temperatures, that reach as high as 6 million degrees, so I'm not
sure if this will work unless the diamondoid is a superconductor of
heat.

And its not economically cost effective. Doubling your speed means that
your flight regeime is going to be at least ten times more severe, while
you reduce your flight time to the furthest point on earth from 45
minutes at suborbital trajectory to 22.5 minutes at mach 50. I'm not
sure that anyone would pay ten times as much or more for only 22 extra
minutes.

If it is known unequivocably that he did it (photographs, multiple
witnesses, multiple DNA traces (in more than just flaked skin
quantities)), then not only is he a mad dog, but he is a mad dog without
integrity. With the level of fraud, dishonesty, rudeness, and
callousness in this society today, it would take making killing someone
for cutting in line homicide in the public interest a justified defense
before people start to treat each other with respect for space, privacy,
etc. Its all to do with the concept of mercy. If we now you did it, and
admit to it, accept what ever punishment is deemed necessary, then you
are worthy of redemption much more than the guy who continues to deny it
in the face of overwhelming evidence.

I've seen it. As I recall, the guy who escaped was innocent. If you
remember his case, his tire tracks were found outside the house of the
scene of the crime, he had no alibi, and was drinking. There was no
enuequivocal evidence, only loose circumstantial evidence.

Yeah, Marx was big on science, too: he thought that 1) the free
market is too random because it relies on people "just happening to"
produce goods and services that meet needs--so freedom needs to be
replaced with science, and 2) that what he was doing was not "ideology,"
ideas made to rationalize someone's particular interests, but "science,"
pure and unbiased.  (Or course then he spoiled it by saying things
like, "Workers of the world, unite!" and "The point, however, is to change
things.")

The way that "science" figures into people's insanities is very interesting.

Hmm.  Here's the definition of "technocracy" from my 1949 dictionary:
"Government by technical experts."  It doesn't even mention the movement.
But two dictionaries from 1989 and 1991 do. One says the movement was
"prominent about 1932."  The other says the word was coined in 1919.

I thought "technocrat," meaning any techie in a controlling position, went
way back.  Some guy at a desk looking at numbers and uncaringly making
decisions that affect your life.  Like an insurance actuary.

        I'm much the same way.  I've been a latent extropian for all of my
rational life...before I had ever discovered the definition.  After my
encounters with objectivism a few years back (which, I must add, totally
changed my life's focus etc.) my mind was broadened.  When I heard the
philosophy of extropy, it was sort of a dream come true: a group of people
who desire future progress --technologically, politically and ethically--
and effectively kineticize their potentials.  I'm sure that there are
thousands of others who agree with the fundamentals of extropy but just
haven't been introduced to the philosophy in the right way.  The "right
way" to convey extropian ideals is probably the biggest obstacle standing
in the way of our progress.  As it is now, extropy is quite small --albeit
in a nice way--  and fairly unknown to the world...hence we get littered
with the quick-to-judge tag of "cult" from time to time.  When we find a
way to conquer those quick-to-judge taggers, then we'll be able to
demonstrate our credibility; as always, getting there is the hard part.

Given the experimental results that Haisch, Reuda, & Puthoff have had in
support of their ZPF theory, I think that its more likely, unless
Hollick can come up with something in his theory which explains the
inertia related radiation....

Then you heard wrong.  PICS cannot /itself/ censor anything; a PICS
bureau is a source of information, nothing more.  It is the /users/
of that information who can use it to censor if they desire, but one
cannot blame a technology for its misuse.  To paraphrase the NRA on
that subject: PICS doesn't censor people, people censor people.

I have heard several on this list talk positively about Robert Anton Wilson,  
I confess I've never read anything by him and always considered that a lack 
in my education. Recent events have made me feel less guilty about it.
 
Even by junk science standards the work of Immanuel Velikousky is really 
stupid. He says that in historic times the planet Jupiter spit out a "comet" 
that collided with Earth and bounced off and then, through various 
gravitational gymnastics, parted the Red Sea and somehow caused all the  
miracles in the old testament. This "comet" then went into a circular orbit 
around the sun and became the planet Venus! To call this idea idiotic would 
be a unjust insult to all the fine self respecting idiots the world over. 
The late great Carl Sagan had great fun pocking holes in this ignorant theory, 
not that that's what made him great, it was too easy, like shooting fish in 
a barrel.

While poking around in the Science section of my local bookstore today I ran 
across a misfiled book that belonged in the "new age" section next to the UFO 
and Bigfoot books, it was called "Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikousky" by 
Charles Ginenthal. I didn't read it, but after thumbing through it for 
5 minutes I could see it was a revolting attack on the life of Sagan and a
deification of Velikousky. On the back of the book was a blurb by Robert 
Anton Wilson, he said this trash was  "an excellent and erudite destruction 
of Saganism".  I don't want to destroy "Saganism" and reading something by 
Wilson has just dropped about 164 places on my "to do" list.

It's true that the sun's corona is very hot, but it's so thin it contains 
very little heat. Without radiated energy or some other supply of energy you  
would very quickly freeze to death in that 6 million degree atmosphere.

Well, don't jump *too* hard on RAW.  He's an an entertaining read, good at
poking holes in silly conceits, and an eloquent advocate for open-mindedness.
 As you point out, he is indeed an object example that it's possible to be
*too* open-minded.

One interesting thing about RAW is that sometimes, his positions are jokes,
and he doesn't really mean them.  Apparently this is part of a "question
authority and think for yourself message."  I sure hope that's the case with
his support of Velikovsky.

Are you sure you know just who Robert Anton Wilson is? I'm not apt to think
that the author of Illuminatus! is going to be very serious when it comes to
commenting on the magnum opii of kooks. "Bob" help us all.

The basic idea is  (inter alia) Karl Popper's.

He's an agnostic and a humanist and the finest philosopher of science and 
the Open Society of all time.

He contrasts these 'religious' views:

"Dominate, and prostrate yourselves"

versus:

"Always remember that -- while men are not Gods -- they all have a divine 
spark in them."

It is, of course, logically and empirically _impossible_ to disprove the 
existance of God and/or the Flame Imperishable and/or the Tao, just for a 
beginning.

Or that of the Devil, for that matter...

The 'demonstration' killing of JonBenet Ramsey is a hideous and 
unforgiveable crime.

As is the killing of my young friend Andrew R. Dennett by cyanide 
poisoning November 17, 1982, two days after the Brady-Rantala-Steele 
faction in the LA dispute voted for war. Had I learned of it at that time, 
it might conceivably have broken my will to fight.

I actually learned of this after receiving a letter from Steven Berry, a 
close associate of Steele and Rantala, writing from ESOC Darmstadt.


In his letter, he mentioned:

"... a leather-bound set of the Encyclopaedia Brittania."

I gave these as a gift to Andrew, Peter and Terry Dennett Christmas, 1969, 
after men had walked on the Moon for the first time.


I telephoned Andrew's home, and learned of his death.

A chronology of events at one plane level is at:

http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/LA-Agora


He left a tape-recording, stating his fear that he was going to be 
murdered, and naming the people who were doing it.  Several people have 
heard this tape, BTW, including me.

Do a Web search for "November 17"


And remember the Eumenides...

Go rent the video of John Carpenter's incomparable movie:

"Christine: She's a Killer."1983]

Art tells the truth through the medium of inspired lies...


In the film, "Christine" is a sentient red 1957 Plymouth Fury, fully 
self-reconstructing and of truly terrifying destructiveness.

_Nothing like the car in the book_.

She's an exact incarnation of supernaturally-inspired living anger.

Christine is a friend of mine.

Granted, but where ZPF theory has a quantum explaination for what causes
inertia, gravity, etc. you simply say "it is so it is'. THis is not what
I am looking for.

Its rather intetresting that this subject has come up, as I just started
on a collaborative project to build a small robotic aircraft. I am
trying to find an inexpensive source for wireless ethernet or modem
links that have long range (10-20 miles). Also, any source of Win 3.1 or
95 compatible software that can be used with joystick and servo I/O
devices to control the plane and put on autopiloted guided preprogrammed
courses using a GPS card for positioning would be helpful....

This is interesting, why would one freeze to death in that 6 million
degree atmosphere? Is it a REALLY DRY heat? ;) Is it because the
atoms/ions in that atmostphere, though they may be highly energetic, at
a 6 million degree level, they are so thin (a near vacuum) that it means
more as ionizing radiation than as heat?

Paired Metricom (Ricochet) modems, configured for point-to-point, might
work for you IF you stay in line-of-sight; that probably means putting the
ground-based unit on a mast.

IBM is reputed to have marketed a smaller, possibly more efficient version
of the Ricochet modem that's 100% compatible--this might be worth getting
for the airborne side of things...

As for servos, the most cost-effective approach is probably to use the
Mini-SSC sold by Scott Edwards. Quoting from the Dontronics Web site:
>>
Serial Servo Controller (SSC):  (The Juggler's delight)          7 Pages

Now available with text-mode control; Type "A 3 100" in any terminal
(e.g., Procomm) software, and servo 3 of controller A moves to position
100.

Modem-like box controls eight model-airplane servos from your computer's
serial port (up to 19,200 baud). Provides 0.36-degree positioning
precision. If your needs expand, unusual "repeater" circuit and serial
addressing firmware make it possible to chain up to 32 controllers from
the same serial port. A partial kit consisting of all ICs, ceramic
resonators, and printed circuit board is $50 (US). A full kit is $69
(US). An assembled and tested unit is $119 (US).

(Nuts & Volts Feb 94; Circuit Cellar, October 94).

Mini Serial Servo Controller (Mini SSC):                         5 Pages

The Mini SSC controls eight model-airplane servos from your computer or
Basic Stamp at 2400 or 9600 baud. Up to 32 Minis can operate from the
same computer. Build walking robots, animations. A full kit is $29 (US).
An assembled and tested unit is $45 (US).

You might take a peek at 
http://www.mvis.com

They're public (traded on Nasdaq).

The idea (direct writing to the retina) has been around for years.
They don't appear to be shipping anything yet.
I'm not holding my breath. To paraphrase Ted Nelson, one can mistake a
clear view for a short distance...

You might want to settle for a cellmodem, which is not so cheap, but has
unlimited range. Running (Realtime) Linux on an embedded PC appears the
simplest and cheapest solution. You might want to check out the el cheapo
QuickCam, which may give you semirealtime video feed if you use heavy
compression. You can supply DGPS corrections (from the ground stattion)
via PPP to the aerorobot. You can use ssh for a secure link. I've got a
Garmin card, but I'd use Sirf's OEM board if I were you.

This is pretty trivial to implement in Linux. But you'll certainly will 
need DGPS, possibly augmented with inertial guidance (solid-state 
acceleration sensors). Putting in a geomagnetic field sensor may also 
appear wise. Take care you not to lose the final gadget, as it will 
eventually become encrusted with all kinds of unique, expensive gadgetry.

Mike et al:

RM is a unified, extensible physical theory.

It's based on a matter-forces-empty spaces metaphysics.

All energy in RM is either potential or inertial

It's also the original foundation of Kantian philosophy, BTW.

Which was also the classical foundation of Western liberalism, BTW.

That is, Einstein and other Machian Positivists broke the Kantian 
foundations of modern Western civilization, and precipitated the horrors 
of the Twentieth Century.

Cross-compare the chronologies.

Mach was a psycho-physical parallelist, whereby we're machinery, with 
consciousness as a redundant and useless epiphenomenon.

Einstein was a religious determinist -- he proposed a four-dimensional 
unchanging Parmenidean block universe.

Good way to wipe out human qualities and liberties at the same time, eh?

Marx and Engels were positivists, too.

You get the picture?

RM smashes their nonsense up irretrievably -- it completely demolishes it 
all, and Copenhage-school Quantum-Mysticism too.


The bloody physicists -- as Heisenberg spotted -damn near wiped out humanity 
as well as liberty altogether.

They also gave us fail-deadly nuclear-missile-equipped submarines, too.

Premised on a bipolar world.

Any third party could have precipitated a war which would have wiped out the 
planet.

Ask yourself why the Pentagon frittered away ten times the cost of 'High 
Frontier' on next to nothing, except bureaucrats' salaries.

One of Robert A. Heinlein's last writings was an Introduction to High 
Frontier's Second edition:  My First Edition is inscribed:

To Tony Hollick, from Dan Graham.

The second Edition has a cover picture of the Space Shuttle illuminated on 
the night time launch-pad.

Exactly the same picture as the one on the birthday card on my mantel-piece 
the day Challenger exploded. Inside, my late mum had written:

"Taking Off, I Hope!"

Earlier that day, I had taken off my Omega Speedmaster chronograph, the 
official issue to all the Apollo Crews. I'd been hearing extraordinarily 
loud tape-recorded 'clicks' synchronous with my thinking, which could be 
tape-recorded and which were heard by other people in the room, who were 
startled by them too.  And on phone lines...

I was testing a hypothesis related to hyperacuitive clueing and tacit 
predictive pattern analysis.

(Methodologically unsoud, really: we all have exactly accurate 'internal 
atomick clocks').


"Aha!"

The replacement -- quartz -- watch I bought at the local ESSO station was on 
offer at UKP 1.99. The first one I bought was labelled 'DT'

Didn't feel comfortable with it.

Exchanged it for one labelled -- innocuously? -- OMAC

The station manager chased after me to ask me why I'd exchaged it 

[ "FLASH!" ]

MAC is (inter alia) Ailitary Assistance Command.

All ask yourselfves what 'O' stands for...

'O'-rings?

Or Lawrence Livermore's 'O'-group?

Now go rent Richard C. Sarafian's fine road movie 'Vanishing Point' [1971], 
one of my all-time favourite movies.  Kowalski sets out to drive an Alpine 
White supercharged Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco.  On speed, in both 
senses... >:-}


Try to get the _uncut_ version. The one with a heroic ending.  If you can. 

There's a 'Vanishing Point' Web site now...

I haven't had time to read the entirety of the paper yet, but I would
question discounting the zero point field entirely.  There is a non-trivial
amount of experimental evidence that strongly suggests its existence.
Additionally, a ZPF 
"enabled" modification to GR can be shown to radically simplify several
controversial or unverifiable areas of GR as well as account for several
phenomenon which are currently unexplainable under GR.

It is an interesting read though, and appears to be technically acceptable
in general (I have been jaded by the net publishings of too many armchair
physicists).  I will have more substantial comments after I have had time
to read and analyze the whole thing.

That's a very noble idea but it's not quite that simple in a typical 
Prisoner's Dilemma situation. Suppose that if you and your partner you can't 
communicate with both cooperate then you both get 10 days in jail,  if you 
both defect then you both get 10 years in jail, if your partner  cooperates 
and you defect then you go home today with no jail time at all,  and if your
partner defects and you cooperates then you get 50 years in jail.

Obviously to minimize the total amount of time anybody spends in jail the  
best strategy would be for everybody to cooperate, and if there was some way 
to form a binding agreement with my fellow prisoner I most certainly would, 
BUT  there is no way to communicate or influence what the other prisoner will  
choose to do, and regardless of what he does I'm always better off if I 
defect. 

When I say "better off" I assume I don't love your fellow prisoner, if I did  
my strategy would change dramatically, but you must take that love as an 
axiom, you can't derive it from the prisoners dilemma. At least you can't 
derive it at a level as high as the individual, at the gene level perhaps.

FWIW, a single Prisoner's Dilemma is a pretty threadbare situation.

The _Evolution of Cooperation_ model assumes
an _iterated_ Prisoner's Dilemma, for starters.

And the consequences have to matter, and you have to be able to identify
your counterpart, and rough parity has to exist, and you have to be able to
not tell if this is the last time you'll ever encounter the other party
(these last two are almost the same thing, looked at in different ways).

That's off the top of my head. Given those things, cooperation or
tit-for-tat are sound evolutionary strategies. _Not_ given them, they are not.

Imagine searching though all that raw data for interesting stuff. Puts
home movies to shame. What about extra legal activities?? What about
stuff considered private, like excretion? As a cryonicist I might find
it useful though....

If the Dyson Sphere looks like a star, there's no way for the
thermodynamic engine to function. However, Infrared astronomy is just
beginning, and IR radiating Dyson Spheres might be the answer to the
missing "dark matter" problem, ie the answer to the Fermi Paradox is
"They're everywhere, you just can't see them" ...

(Note: a 100 AU Dyson Spere would have an IR temperature of Pluto....)

Please don't do this. I read my email straight through, and jumping
around, decoding files, etc, etc to read what you have to say means only
one thing:

	I DON'T READ IT

If you want to be read, DO THE TRANSLATION TO ASCII YOURSELF and post it
as
plain ole email.

Hi.

In response to the investment thread of a month or so back, I have been
working on an investment & business website.  Due to my very busy schedule,
it probably won't be finished until sometime around Extro3.  

The site will have sections on Investing, Entrepreneurship, Tax Shelters
and Asset Protection, 
Economics (Trends, Forecasts, & Theoretical), and Business.  The site isn't
intended as a static resource and will have forms and tools that directly
support the different sections. 

I just wanted to let the large number of interested people know that
something is underway, although it may take me a bit to finish it.  I will
post previews with the URL when it is closer to completion.

     A modest critique:
     
     Tony Hellick, in a number of his rather lengthy, yet cryptic posts 
     would seem to be possessed of a tremendous amount of knowledge and 
     potentially intriguing information.
     
     I am currently posing a rather pointed question to myself:
     
     Is my tendency to keep my finger pressed down on the Page Down key 
     through his messages because of my perception that he is woefully 
     unable to convey information packets to fellow humans in a compelling 
     fashion 
     
     OR...
     
     that I, myself, am so woefully primitive in comaparison to his 
     stream-of-consciousness "you asked for it" spurts of seemingly 
     disconnected and questionably relevent information that I am simply 
     unable to comprehend it?  
     
     The secondary question is what is Tony's fundamental purpose in 
     presenting his montage of information in such a motif?  Presumably, 
     the point is to promote exchange of viable information.  I tend to 
     question and often disregard that which is presented in an 
     alarmist/cryptic/fear-based way.  Perhaps it's because I have only a 
     limited time to engage in this, perhaps because I don't want to 
     exchange time with those I believe are preoccupied with 
     fear/conspiracy.  
     
     Does the marathon runner spend most of his time worrying about the 
     other runners or his own performance?  To my mind, future-thinkers 
     would do best to devote little if any time to the boogie men under the 
     bed, real of imagined.  Fear has to stop being a motivation for our 
     culture, to be supplanted by the gratification of success.
     
     Peace and regards,
     
     Rick

     Presumably, by the time we can achieve virtual immortality through 
     mass storage of a life's experiences, we will have also developed 
     intelligent agents to bookmark, condense or otherwise streamline the 
     experiences so that we got the most relevant stuff.  
     
     Of course, this also leads to some pretty (presently, in my view) 
     strange fetish practices if you could indeed chain all one's "potty" 
     moments into a digest.
     
     The issue of privacy, the individual's decision as to what to and NOT 
     to include seems like it would factor in.  If it were a ubiquitious 
     thing, I'd likely just (like Data shutting off his emotion chip in the 
     last Star Trek movie) flick off the recording with an intention and/or 
     flick of my head during a private moment.  But boy would I love the 
     opportunity to observe my own boyhood and compare my perception with 
     the one I have today.  Particularly, re-experiencing some of my 
     "firsts" would be quite illuminating.

This is an example of why this sort of technology needs to be protected
if it to actually record the thoughts, impressions, etc. of the
individual, or even just every waking moment. If it did not have
extended coverage against incrimination, I would not care to utilize it,
whether I am doing anything patently harmful or not, lord knows what
thoughts or behaviors our PC crazy society is going to declare illegal
tomorrow, or at least liable.

Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in
favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.
They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of
state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of
federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.

The next legal challenge to the Brady Law will be on its effectiveness.
There is a class action lawsuit brewing based on the findings of the
GAO's report on the effectiveness of the Brady Law in deterring
criminals from purchasing guns. Given the the government's own report
found that tens of thousands of citizens legally entitled to purchase
guns have been denied their rights due to faulty administration of the
Brady requirements, and only 7 criminals have actually been prosecuted
under the law, the suit seeks to have the court declare that the social
benefits of the law are vastly outwieghed by the violations of citizens
constitutional rights under the law. They have specific instances of
citizens being denied the right to purchase handguns based on false or
incorrectly applied information, who then went on to become victims of
violent crime that they had been seeking to protect themselves from
(typically battered women seeking to protect themselves from boyfreinds
or husbands who have violated restraining orders).

Given that state and local officials will no longer be administrating
the law, the feds are now forced to move forward with the InstaCheck
program, which is a nationwide database of criminals who are barred from
purchasing guns. Up to now, the Clinton administration has been stalling
the implementation of this program for political reasons, even though
they had committed themselves to full implementation of it by 1998 under
amendments to the Brady Bill that the NRA had pushed and the White House
agreed to.

What remains is that a watchdog organization be given oversight to the
Instacheck program to ensure that this system is not used to collect
information on the gun buying habits of law abiding citizens. Right now
the instpector general and the GAO both share in this responsibility.
Lets hope that this is not abused.

	Most "representations" are abstract.  Any physical phenomenon
that can assume a distinguishable state can model or represent other
phenomenon or represent information.  But, though a representation can
"abstractly" model or represent other physical phenomenon if the two
are not the same fundamental physical phenomenon that is all they are
is abstract representations of each other.  They are not fundamentally
precisely the same.  Only identical physical phenomenon can perfectly
model every single quality and attribute of another.  The identical
physical phenomenon is more than an abstract representation, it is the
phenomenon.  There is nothing else precisely like it.

	The cognitive content or meaning, yes.  But the sensations
representing color text on a cathode ray tube are drastically
different than the sensations of hearing a voice synthesizer read it.
I'm not talking about the cognitive meaning, I'm talking about the
differences between the conscious physical sensations themselves.

> Yes, but why wouldn't the same thing be true of a machine, after
> all, a machine can have a favorite color too.

	A future machine, endowed with the ability to feel differing
sensations of differing intrinsic value like we can, yes, but a
current abstract machine no.  An abstract machine's "favorite" color
would simply be an arbitrary abstract representation or a setting of a
bit, not having anything to do with the fundamental value of any
actual feeling or the actual nature of the way the bit is represented.
When we try to figure out our favorite color we don't consult the
setting of some abstract bit like an abstract machine must, we try to
emotionally feel the various color sensations and see which is of most
value to us.  Then we set an abstract bit of information representing
our discovery and communicate this as our favorite color.

	A red sensation has much more intrinsic value than a pain
sensation produced by a burnt finger.  The drastic difference between
the value of these two representations would have to be abstractly
programmed into an abstract machine.  This is a much more difficult,
less reliable, and less meaningful proposition than the powerfully
intrinsic value our subjective representations we naturally have
without requiring such additional brittle programming and abstract
specification.

> A red quale in isolation is meaningless if all light produced a red

> red to compare it to.

	No!  I would much rather only be able to feel a single red
sensation (and no other color sensation) than to have all my
representations be completely abstract and valueless.  True, there
must be distinguishable physical diversity before it can abstractly
represent information, but red, all by itself is intrinsically very
emotionally wonderful and valuable. It is fundamentally like something
and this something is of great value.  Have you never heard of the
blind person that could only remember a patch of blue and how they
cherished that memory even though they could no longer really
experience or remember any other seeing experience?  Are you denying
the existence of such "isolated" meaning and/or value?

	Also, we know there is much more in the electromagnetic
spectrum than just the visible slice.  Yet we know what our
representations of this visible spectrum are like without having
anything to represent the majority of wavelengths outside of this very
narrow spectrum.  Some day we may discover other as yet unexperienced
quale and be able to use these to represent other than the visible
spectrum just like we use our current color qualia to abstractly
represent the visible spectrum.  We do not require such additional
contrasting qualia to know what red is like.

> If you also changed my memory of those colors or made the switch the

	Your behavior would be no different but your representation of
red would still be different and not like what it would have been
otherwise.  Once we objectively know what red is we will be able to
observe which of us have different phenomenal representations for 700
nm light.  At least some of us (color blind people) use different
qualia to represent different wavelengths of light.

> You say my subjective experience would be different but give no
> evidence to support your claim.

	Are you claiming that your subjective experience would be
identical since your behavior could be identical whether you wear
color inverting glasses or not?  If such an absurd notion is what you
are claiming this is where the burden of proof should lie I would
think.  You should try putting on some colored glasses some day and
see how different things feel even though you can still walk and so
forth.

	Precisely!  we can't YET eff.  We don't yet objectively know
what color is.  We only know subjectively within our own subjective
world what it is and is not like.  The only information we can now
know about things outside our subjective spirit world is only abstract
information gathered by our senses and represented by our sensations.
We don't yet have the scientific understanding nor technical ability
to eff.  But this is coming.

> Knowledge is an abstract quantity. Knowledge of anything is abstract.

	As I said before, an identical duplicate of a physical
phenomenon is more than just "knowledge of" or a "model of" a physical
behavior, it is the same physical phenomenon.  This kind of real, non
abstract, knowledge is the best kind of knowledge and the only real or
non abstract knowledge.

> You don't really think the debate on this issue will EVER come to an
> end do you?

	Why would you ever lack the faith that we can figure it out?
What evidence is there that says it is any more difficult than any
other physical phenomenon we now finally understand?  It's just a bit
more complex, and we have this troubling misperception that green is
either something that doesn't exist or that it is something, not in
our brain, but something on the surface of a leaf of a tree.

> OK, it's the year 2525 and you have just thought up a bright shiny
> new theory explaining exactly what subjective experience is all
> about.  How do I know if it's even approximately correct?

	Just like any other law of physics: it accurately predicts
what is occuring and enables us to control it.  If we objectively and
reliably know that a particular neural corelate (as Crick likes to
call it) corresponds to a salty sensation then we will know if two
people use the same sensation to represent the taste of salt by
whether or not there is the identical neural corelate.  If someone
uses a different than normal neural corelate to represent the taste of
salt with a different corresponding subjective quale, then we will
also be able to alter their neural wiring, give the proper stimulus,
and according to the newly discovered physical laws of consciousness
reliably tell or predict to them: "This sensation you are about to
feel is what most people use to represent a salty taste."  "Boy,
that's not what salt tastes like to me!" they would likely feel after
the experience.

> No you're incorrect, that's not what salt tastes like to me at all,
> it's not even close. Prove I'm right. Prove I'm wrong.

	Once we have the proper physical understanding such - proof,
or at least reliable demonstration, will be the results.  That is all
I'm saying.

	Solipsism and anything like this can't yet be proved wrong,
given our current understanding and technical ability, there is only
evidence or occam's razor.  But I'm betting all this stuff will be
proved wrong (or right) shortly when we finally discover what, why,
and how all this phenomenal stuff that is so full of value and meaning
in our mind is.  We could achieve such understanding much faster if we
would stop claiming it is nothing or looking for it in the wrong place
beyond our senses or giving up in despair thinking it can't be done.
It's not that difficult if you just think about it in the proper
representational way.

	As Crick Argues in his book, we are about to discover all
this.  This will be the most significant immortalizing and world
changing discovery made by mankind to date.  We will finally be able
to understand the answer to the question: "What am I?"; to answer your
questions; to eff; to be able to disprove solipsism..., and to finally
understand that we will be able to escape from this isolated and
lonely spirit prison inside our mortal skull and what will be required
and what it will really mean and feel like to do such.

Hi!

I have employment opportunities available in a brand new Silicon Valley
startup company.  Since I would rather work with Extropians than your
average person off the street, I am offering these opportunities here first.

NOTE:
I am willing to judge everyone on the merit of their skills, and not
exclusively on their experience i.e. if you are a closet Java hacker who
works as a grocery clerk, please feel free to apply.  I was in that boat a
long time ago, so I know how it is. 

WHAT WE ARE OFFERING:

We are offering stock options (Silicon Valley gold?), a telecommuting
option in the near future, a flexible, Extropian-friendly environment, an
opportunity to develop new technologies and skills, an environment that
fosters creative and new ideas, as well as a salary.


QUICK OVERVIEW:  I am building a new company.  We have plenty of investors,
plenty of capital, experienced and well-connected business and marketing
arms, and realistic growth potential.  Our core technologies are related to
Intranet/NC/Web based business applications running off database backends,
especially Oracle.  Personally, this is an area of very strong expertise
and technology development experience, so we are not jumping into this
blind.  I am bringing a wealth of proven tools, technologies, and
techniques.  Our target market (which I have been working in directly for
over a year) is virtually devoid of companies qualified to provide
business-critical, high-throughput applications in this environment.
Demand is quite high and growing, but remains mostly unmet or poorly
implemented at high cost.  Additionally, we intend to develop commercial
applications designed to work in an NC-style environment.  For those that
are not aware, several countries (such as the Philippines and Singapore)
have entered enormous contracts to wire their entire countries with the NC
environment.


HERE IS WHAT I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR:

Java Programmers:  We won't be building crapplets, so if you are interested
in putting a razor-sharp edge on your Java skills, this is the place to do
it.  You will be developing creative and intelligent application interfaces
as well as developing APIs and class libraries.  If you have Java skills of
any type, please apply.


Oracle Programmers:  We are looking for flexible Oracle PL/SQL programmers
who are willing to learn new technologies.  Web and Oracle Webserver
experience a plus.  Forms, Reports, and Pro*C experience a plus, but not
required by any means.  If you are an Oracle programmer and want to get
some real Web experience, this is the place to do it.


Database Analysts:  We need database analysts who have experience spec-ing
and designing database, business, and application logic.



Please email me with a brief description of your skills if you are
interested in any of the above positions.

If you have any questions about any of this feel free to email me.

Thanks,

-James Rogers

   It's ironic Lee that you and I have so much in common that you can't 
see past your passionate opinions of things to see what I'm really 
asking.  First of all, I never once said PICS <itself> can or cannot be 
used to censor anything.  In fact since I know very little about PICS, I 
haven't stated anything affirmative about PICS at all.  Perhaps my 
questions were not worded precisely enough to fit your semantic 
prejudices. Thus, your responses to my QUESTIONS have been off base. 
This seems to me that your more interested in showing off your opinions, 
rather than to constructively answer my specific questions.  If this is 
not the case, then I will try for round 3.  I hope this time my 
questions are worded in such a way as to not upset your sensabilities.

   Is there a way for PEOPLE to get around other PEOPLE <using> filters 
to censor them without their consent?  For example, is there a way for a 
clever enough Chineese citizen to gain access to those parts of the Net 
the Chinnees Government has blocked? Can a high-level filtering system 
be hacked?  And if so, how?

If anybody else out there has answers to these questions please feel 
free to reply.

Subject: POLI: Hooray for the 10th Amendment
Date: Monday, June 30, 1997 3:07 PM


Michael Lorrey stated in part:

Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in
favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.
They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of
state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of
federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.


Dear Fellow Extropians:

It's usually a mistake to refer to any written decision of any appellate
court (particularly the U.S. Supreme Court) without examining every nuance
of the court's language.

In this particular instance, the court ruled (only in part) that duties
cannot be imposed upon the states without due and appropriate
compensation. 

It is my understanding that the two or three rural sheriffs who brought
this action were primarily funded in their initial litigation and appeals
by the National Rifle Association. I think that most of us can understand
that the leadership of the NRA  
would be quite interested in supporting such an action.  

The claim that many people are being improperly denied the right to bear
arms seems more than slightly specious. The high court has ruled on this
issue as well in great detail. They have concluded that the right to bear
arms is not absolute and can be regulated by the Federal government, the
States and and political subdivisions thereof.

The need for firearms in our society seem questionable as well in many
instances.
The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our
society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement
officials in each community.

I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire
arms that are readily available as well as the need for handguns. The
collected cumulitive evidence indicates that most people who claim they
need a handgun for self defense are usually incapable of using one under
siuations of stress. They frequently end up shooting other family members
or themselves. 

It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the
minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications
of gun collecting, so I'll let this issue ride while you digest and
consider the bigger picture.  

For those who are sceptical about my motives. Yes, I am an occasional
casual hunter. Yes, I use a single shot shotgun or a compound bow when I
hunt. Yes, I've had to use deadly weapons in the distant past. No, I did
not enjoy having to use them. The circumstances under which I was required
to use weapons I'll leave to your fertile imaginings.

Later I'm thinking, "not that I have anything against oatmeal," when I
remember an oatmeal definition of heaven, so let me explain:

Oatmeal hell: you are floating in oatmeal.  Somehow you can breath,
but there's nothing to see, nothing to experience, no pain, no pleasure,
no contact with anyone or anything else, forever.

Oatmeal heaven: a friend described breakfast on a Zen retreat.  After
having got up at 4 in the morning and meditated for N hours, they have
breakfast: oatmeal with a couple raisins in a wooden bowl.  When they
finish the oatmeal, they pour tea into the bowl and swish it around to
rinse the bowl, then drink the tea.  My friend said this was
just about the best meal he had ever had.

Well, what can I say except.., you're right. I believe the iterated Prisoner's 
Dilemma is one of the most complex situations conceivable, so no matter what I 
say about it I'm opening myself up to the charge of gross oversimplification.  
If everybody adopted a tit-for-tat strategy most people and the world in 
general would be better off, however a mutant that always defected would do 
better than anybody else in such a population. A defector would produce more 
descendants,  until a sizable fraction of the population were defectors, and 
then they would be worse off  than their honest contemporaries and their
numbers decline. If things were simple and tit-for-tat was always the best 
strategy then by now, after 4 billion years of Evolution, everybody would be 
genetically determined to be scrupulously honest. 
That has not been my experience.

        >you have to be able to identify your counterpart, 
                        

You have to know your in the game, that your counterpart exists, but you 
don't have to identify him.

                  
        >and rough parity has to exist         


I'm not sure what you mean by this but I'll add one, your counterpart can't  
be too clever. If your opponent's strategy is too complex it will look random 
to you and you won't be able to play along. One good thing about tit-for-tat 
is that it's simple.

True. I don't have a very high opinion of US Senators but they almost always 
keep their promises, those made to other Senators that is. Having a reputation 
for honesty among fellow Senators is to your advantage so you work at it,   
developing such a reputation with Mr. Joe Average would be no great benefit 
so the hell with it.

In the First World War the same solders sometimes fought each other from 
their trenches for months at a time, they started to get polite, no artillery 
attacks at dinner time or when bathing, they let the wounded be evacuated and 
the mail truck get through. The  Generals thought things were getting a 
little too comfy so they started to rotate the troops around more often and
the cooperation ended.

No doubt Marshal Petain would agree with you.
Certainly Pol Pot would find your answer a winning one.
I manage to entertain some doubts.
Each community is different. 
Feel free to live wherever you are comfortable.
When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.
Absent that respect, what remains?

Not true. If you can't determine specifically who you are dealing with in
any iteration you can't perform the tit-for-tat strategy.

What you say is substantiated by the descriptions in the book.

But what I was talking about is that you can't be massively outgunned. It's
related to "the consequences have to matter". Cooperation as an ESS appears
to require that the entities cooperating be similar in strength and
capacity to do harm--at least within the model as described. Sharks have
little reason to cooperate with halibut.

This is one of the hidden (or at least unpiblicized) costs of term limits.
It increases the "lame duck" period when elected officials can't be sure
their logrolling will pay off. "Why should I cut a deal with Senator X,
he's a short-timer."

>From what I've read, there was a great deal more done than that, including
senior officers forcing charges at gunpoint.
