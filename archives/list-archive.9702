Michael, Paul has it right.  It is *possible* to transfer power using
electromagnetic waves, that was what the entire space colony/ solar power
satellite was based on.  But what Tesla proposed makes no sense (given
current understanding of physics) if for no other reason than the
inefficiencies involved. (Square law, folks.)

And, harmonizing is what a barbershop quartet does, the word in this
context is no more meaningful than harmonizing with rock.  I speak both as
a Tesla fan, who built a Tesla coil (radio frequency ~800kHz) which
generated yard long sparks as a teenager, and an electrical engineer who
knows a lot about power engineering and RF power.

The Life Extension Foundation states (at http://www.lef.org/subjects/diet.htm)
that "[the] ideal diet for health and longevity is a low-calorie, low-fat, 
low-salt, diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain foods and 
high-fiber foods." Not quite as specific as you requested, but I don't
think anyone knows how to optimize diet for longevity yet.

Beware starting calorie restriction too young or too quickly. I wish
I had an authoritative source for this, but the CR FAQ makes no such
warning. All I can say is that in my own notes on calorie restriction 
(http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/lifex.html#cr) I've recorded
several comments to this effect - most likely picked up from
sci.life-extension. One even went so far as to say, "Don't start
until you're 45."

Reilly Jones quotes some comments from Omega I have not seen before, I've 
been having trouble with mail the last few days and  I did think one of his 
posts ended a little abruptly

Godel and Turing did different things. Godel proved that any logical system 
is incomplete or inconsistent or both. Turing showed that you can't, 
in  general, prove that a statement is untrue or true but unprovable, 
so you can never tell if the best thing to do is just give up looking for 
a proof. Maybe you'll find a proof to prove it correct or a counterexample 
to prove it wrong in 5 minutes, maybe 5 in 5 billion years, maybe never.

Let's look at something a little less emotional than free will , pressure. 
When I blow up a balloon pressure causes it to expand and eventually pop. 
But what is this thing "pressure"? Is it a mysterious non material fifth 
force that floats around in no particular place and causes things to expand? 
No, pressure is just a higher level description, a description of the 
collective motions of particles. The molecules don't know anything about
pressure, they just bounce around according to Newton's law's of motion. 
Our tiny brains are not able to cope with the trillions of collisions of air 
molecules against the side of the balloon so we must go to a higher level 
description. In this example you lose a little accuracy but at a HUGE saving 
in complexity, in some cases you may not lose any accuracy at all. 
Although It is perfectly true that William Shakespeare made his living and
reputation by putting a subset of ASCII characters in a particular sequence 
I think you would do better in  a literature  test if you thought about it at 
a somewhat higher level.        

Similarly it's usually not appropriate to talk about quantum jumps or even 
neuron firings when trying to understand human behavior (although 
Nanotechnology may change that) ; we use higher level concepts like reason, 
judgment, belief, preference, emotion and free will.           
Wow, all this talk about higher level meaning has made me hungry, I think 
I'll go to a restaurant, look at the air pressure graph I made at the last
Beethoven Symphony and relax. 

Of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.
Why?   
Because I want to.   
Why?   
Because I want to eat.  
Why?  
Because I'm hungry?   
Why ?  
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses  in my stomach , my brain  
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try to 
stop it.   
Why?  
Because I don't like pain.  
Why?   
Because that's the way my brain is constructed.   
Why?  
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the information  
in my genetic code  (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits per base pair  
8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, you could put it on a 
700 meg hard disk with stacker)  the programming of my brain came from the  
environment, add a little quantum randomness perhaps and of my own free will  
I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.

Yes, it's a tautology, in exactly the same way that all true equations are 
tautologies, the same idea expressed in a different way.

Haven't you seen Unix giving up ground in favour of NT? That's a real

Multithreaded flavours of Unix do exist, see Mach. SMP version of

That's property of the file system, not of the OS. I don't see why we
at all need file systems, when virtual memory, persistant objects and
garbage collection would do perfectly.

NFS is slow, but it works. A faster version has been released recently,

It wasn't free during most of the time, desastrous marketing being

Just today I stumbled across the archives of the virus list for the

Sigh, just what I need, another mailing list to keep me busy.

Maybe not so amazing when we realize that this European logic, is so
powerful because for the first time the human race finally captured
the essential logic of the particular Fourier space that our bodies
are localized in.  The Cartesian coordinate system IS, after all, the
coordinate system that captures localization within this Fourier space.

That's the problem, what we are familiar with in our formal logic
is simply too narrow to capture the fullness of reality.  But
hopefully a recognition of its limits might lead us to broaden 
our horizons.

A messyness that is compounded by people promoting alternative 
logics and cultural relativism without any regard whatsoever 
for the truth.  This is what it all boils down to, do we have
a committment to speak the best truth we can when bouncing
around from viewpoint to viewpoint.

Very true.  Its only value is as a conceptual tool that can point out to us
where we are limited, and only then, if we haven't blinded our ontological
perception with the use of tautologies.

I'll have to check out Santa Fe again.  They definitely seem to have some 
interesting projects going on.  With regard to the metaphysics which has
been long out of favor in our culture, it seems like the curse of the human
race is that every flowering of culture seems to think that its current per-
ception of reality is in some way a knowledge of absolute truth thus blinding
themselves to what could only be called the meta-reality behind the "curtain"
we aren't supposed to look behind.

Even things as intractable as this business of a priori and a posteriori
logic that you mentioned above might suddenly appear in a new light when
viewed from the atemporal.  I don't know if knowledge of the atemporal 
will lead us to an absolute truth, but I would certainly expect it to be
a good step closer.

This business of chaos also relates to that other can of worms that we call
the "technological singularity".  While I certainly agree that we can't 
expect to coast through this, I have an ever growing sense that what we call
the "technological singularity" is in fact a "fractal event-horizon" in a
very literal sense.  When we look at the full set of symmetries we find in
reality, a "fractal event-horizon" is a well definable concept that almost
demands an accompanying "technological singularity".  It would be, if 
attained, a point of irreversibility of extropian germination.

It sure seems like the discussion John and I were having (along with Lyle's
Venus thread) were setting the stage for this idea.  All I know is that it
dawned on me while responding to Lyle's post that Fourier spaces define a
form of incompleteness of knowledge as fundamental as Godel's.  I'm some-
what shocked that nobody seems to have generalized this principle before.

Seems like I answered this in advance in my other post.  Funny how
metaphysics always keeps coming back from the dead no matter how many
times human culture tries to drive a stake through its heart.

Discrete or not, unless someone can get rid of that second order differential
equation, we seem stuck with this 50% backward in time causality in any case.

I highly suspect that the failure of the geometrical approach is directly
related to this problem of Fourier spaces as the Heisenberg uncertainty 
which lies at the heart of quantum physics IS nothing but this business
of Fourier spaces showing up as a general principle in physical reality
itself.

Of course, this just begs the question of the priority of, and relation 
between, mental spaces and physical spaces.  One of the biggest unanswered
questions in the philosophy of science is the uncanny correlation physical
reality and the totally arcane branches of mathematics that sometimes get
discovered centuries before they are shown to have any relationship to
physical reality.

Actually I see it as a very really possibility that we will find a dichotomy 
in which both continuous (above plank scale that is) and discrete time systems
coexist.  In fact by symmetry, it must be this way considering how energy and
time are tied together the way they are; the more one is continuous, the more
the other must be quantized.  We fail to notice this symmetry because, we fail
to take seriously the reality of momentum space and the fact that what we see
as quantized energy IS time itself from the perspective of momentum space.

Yes, momentum space has its own arrow of time which is not only backwards to 
ours, but quantized by what we call energy to boot (the direction of the 
arrow being defined by the default temporal direction that wave packets in
that Fourier space spontaneously spread).  This is the overlooked symmetry
that allows time-symmetric dynamic laws to create asymmetric time in the 
first place.  The symmetry reappears when we realize that momentum space 
has its own (backwards to us) arrow of time with its own 2nd law of thermo-
dynamics that must be obeyed.  

Likewise, we might expect that a "global" 2nd law also exists such that 
violations of probability are allowed within either realm so long as it's
conserved globally.  Such a global conservation of the 2nd law is not phy-
sically impossible, but the only good metaphor for describing this sort of
meta-time that I've yet seen is P. K. Dick's idea of "an orthogonal time"
that operates in the meta-reality behind what we currently know.  In this
system of meta-time, the 2nd law would be conserved globally so long as 
the mass and volume of the cosmos never decreases within meta-time.  

Modern cosmology already knows this in its understanding that "bouncing
big-bangs" must always get larger.  There is no new physics here, only
a recognition of the time-symmetries that comes from a generalization of
our concept of reality as applying equally to all Fourier spaces.  With
this comes an understanding that a generalized math capable of reconcil-
ing all the Fourier spaces within reality is going to require a system
that combines continuous differential equations with fractals and other
forms of discrete math into a seamless whole.  There is certainly, in 
this, a nobel prize awaiting some young mathematical genius (Eliezer?).

This also leads to the realization of the ultimate extropian dream of 
physically relocating to an alternative Fourier space when one's local 
"universe" becomes too "entropic".  It's just another more advanced form
of uploading.  Just like we could well gain a general ability to do up-
loading and other forms of "personal designer life" in the near future,
there is no reason why, in the far future trillions of years from now,
we couldn't build bodies in an alternative Fourier space; after all with 
modern QM we already know how to manipulate momentum space.  In fact, we
don't even need any fundamentally new science here, just a few eons of
practice developing our quantum engineering skills, which is something
that our existing universe is certainly still good for.  In doing this,
we need merely brush up on our ability to utilize the momentum space
analogs of gravity and electromagnetism (which we already know about in
the phenomena of Bose-Einstein condensation and fermion spin-pairing
respectively) to build up the structures we need.

Not withstanding my own writings about the role of Fourier spaces in
human thought, it's clear that our monkey brains aren't really good at
viewing this equally well from all angles.  And yet I find it amazing
that we do as well as we do in understanding this stuff.

This is a very good point.  Nothing stops the data in any given space from
simply being wrong.  If the data's wrong, changing the space isn't going to
help matters; no panacea here.

Strange that the very process that was responsible for the genius inside of
Feynman's head was what led him to confirm in physical reality what these 
philosophers had been saying a generation before.

Now we're getting to the subject of absolute truth which brings to mind 
the interesting question as to whether any mathematician has ever made any
headway in defining and using a generalized mathematical space which would
include all Fourier spaces?  I'd be suprised if someone has done this.

This is an excellent point.  I mentioned that evolutionary psychology would
constrain the generality of the process, but frankly I'm suprised to see 
that it is so limited.  In any case, I agree that our evolutionary past 
would highly bias the states we experience in favor of those that played a
large role in our genetic and memetic past.  When I said generalized, I 
meant generalized in principle by the fact that our brains have hardware
that operates in conjugate waveform spaces, but meant that to be limited
by my later discussion which talked about constraints in the process.

And the pathways between the varying spaces could well have varying degrees
of constriction/resistance.  Strange, how in the purely abstract realm of 
memetics and cognitive process, that this gives us such a remarkably strong
basis for applying the metaphors of fluid dynamics in such a meaningful way.

Your right about this being a generalized uncertainty principle at work, but
when I talked about holding simultaneous viewpoints for small problems, I was
proposing that the brain might operate in an explicitly parallel mode that
simultaneously holds a number opposing viewpoints with mediocre precision.
For larger problems, it would be exactly as you say.

By brain plasticity, I meant the ability to engage in moment to moment brain
plasticity in the here and now as we learn new stuff.  You're very right in
calling it brain sludge if it's something that shaped us in the past that
can't be changed now.

This is something that I neglected to mention, but what you describe is a
real problem.  I have a feeling that sooner or later some school of post-
modern deconstructionist philosophers is going to have a field day using
something like this as a high-pressure fire hose to spew out more compost.
On the other hand, compost can often make good fertilizer for new things
to grow in.

Not to mention the vast amount of inexplicable psychosomatic phenomena
swirling around.  It may not explain everything, but mind-body interaction
is loaded with intractable problems, of which one of the most blatant is 
the known ability for multiples to have differing allergen profiles.

Or the often repeated martial arts claim that at sufficiently advanced 
levels, the learning is a whole body learning.  I remember Minsky ripping
someone to shreds at the extro-2 conference for bringing this up during a
Sat night Q&A session, but it's very possible that Minsky might have been
wrong on this, especially with regards to kinesthetic perception and maybe
even with regards to ultra-fine muscle control.

I find it amazing that so few of those interested in uploads are paying
any attention to this lack of analog in proposed upload schemes.  
Digital is nice, but this business of waveform families and their 
associate spaces is not in any way insignificant.

I think you are a bit too harsh here. We can't list for certain *every*
nutrient we need, but we can make a quite good list of those we know of,
and they make up most of the food we eat (the unknown ones are most likely
present in the same food that is rich in the known nutrients). A bit
harder is optimal dosages, there is a big interindividual variability and
experimental uncertainties (the RDA is after all just "recommended"). 

As others have pointed out, the best way of getting the necessary
nutrients right now at a reasonable price is just healthy food, eating a
chemical mixture is bound to be expensive and unpalatable.  See nutrition
and health websites for discussions of a good diet.

CR looks promising, but it is most likely very hard to turn directly from 
a normal diet to a CR diet; instead it is most likely a good idea to 
first starte eating healthy low-calorie food, and once you have made that 
a habit move towards CR. A direct jump is bound to lead to hunger and 
motivation problems.

Intriguing, captain.  I discussed some of these issues in the introduction
to my book READING BY STARLIGHT:

"In an effort to break free of both self-validating and self-defeating
mechanisms of discourse, I have drawn inspiration from a fertile speculation
advanced by the philosopher Elizabeth Grosz, who lists the likely outcomes
of the confrontation between traditional phallocognitive philosophy and
feminist critique and construction of an alternative procedure.
Confrontations of this kind are by no means purely iconoclastic.  As
Genevieve Lloyd observes: `Such criticisms of ideals of Reason can in fact
be seen as continuous with a very old strand in the western philosophical
tradition; it has been centrally concerned with bringing to reflective
awareness the deeper structures of inherited ideals of Reason.'
		
"While Grosz writes specifically of a new feminist philosophy, I take her
observations to have a certain general validity.  The new critical
philosophy diverges in several important ways from previously canonised
approaches.  Hardly monolithic, or orchestrated around a `transcendental
signified', it is neither relativist or pluralist but perspectivist:
`acknowledg[ing] other points of view but den[ying] them equal value'. 		

"That is, it asserts commitment without falling into coercive univocity or
undecidable agnosticism.  This approach, born under the sign of
poststructuralism but hardly identical with it, deviates from the Western
tradition in a crucial break:  `[I]t can openly accept its own status (and
that of all discourses) as context-specific.'  Perspectivism can openly avow
its own political position: `all texts speak from or represent particular
positions within power relations...  Instead of aspiring to the status of
truth,' such a philosophy `prefers to see itself as a form of strategy.'
But these strategies are not abstractions.  `Instead of dividing theory from
practice [among many other dichotomous impositions...] philosophy may regard
theory as a form of practice....'  Far from either valorising or condemning
traditional ways of arguing logically from hegemonically-ordained premises,
it `expands the concept of reason' .		
"There are serious difficulties in abandoning boring old forms of logic.
What's more, I am by no means convinced that the program of an expanded
literary, philosophical or scientific discourse can or ought take the step
into the abyss which Grosz proposes (a step which is implicit, admittedly,
in many texts by such poststructuralists as Lacan, Foucault, Derrida and
Baudrillard).  The newly-dimensioned space required to replenish writing and
thinking, Grosz speculates, `may be capable of sustaining several types of
discourse, many perspectives and interests (even contradictory ones).  No
one form dominates the others'.
		
"These are large claims, but their intent is generous, more insistent on a
declaration of a speaker's position, and those of a speaker's opponents,
than to any certified truth; open to a measure of passion and rhetoric
usually regarded within the academy as indecorous at best.
		
"The analytic technique I'm trying to employ in this book is grounded also
in the view that to a much larger extent than is usually understood the
reader constructs her own argument as well as her own text.  This is why I
frequently urge my case by means of collage, sometimes scathingly rather
than coolly framed, displaying exemplary citations alongside each other in a
rhetorically heightened context which presses to a conclusion without
feigning to `prove' it."

It strikes me that email list discussions automagically take just this
rhetorical-cum-logical form.  :)

All materials here are formalized, and protocols are known,
so any celestial intervention should be detectable with a good

Net is essentially a growing God-free zone?
  Anybody knows what religious people think of this?

Our bodies are manifesations of our minds and our spirits?  Am I on the

Why would God need to intervene on the net? Why would God need to exist

Hmm, sounds a bit like the African (?) idea that the gods can't perceive

Obviously Einstein knew that from the reference frame of an observer moving 
at the speed of light the distance to any point in the universe is zero, 
and he knew that time grinds to a complete halt, and he knew that space-time  
shrinks to a mathematical point; he is after all the very man who figured
this out for the first time. Einstein also knew that we can not move at the 
speed of light, and he is also the first man to figure that out.
 
By "local" Einstein wanted a definition that could be of some use, he mente  
there is no superluminal action at a distance, we now know from experimental  
evidence that there IS superluminal action at a distance, even if we can't 
use it to communicate in a superluminal way. It is an experimental fact that 
Bell's inequality IS violated, and it would NOT be violated if the world 
was locally causal. Even if we someday find a better theory than Quantum 
Mechanics, any successful theory must  explain that experimental result. 
    
If Cramer claims that his theory is local then he is also claiming that it 
is untrue, however I have never heard him say anything like that, instead he  
talks about everyday events "shaking hands with the universe", and as I said  
before, that's about as non-local as you can get.

One reason we know that we still have a lot to learn is that the 2 giant 
pillars of modern Physics, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics have  
little in common, until Hawking's work 30 years ago they had nothing in  
common. We still have a long way to go before we have a Quantum Theory of 
gravity, and gravity is General Relativity's strong point.

Actually I never said that free-will had to be entirely divorced from our
sense perceptions, the nature of the environment, our brain state, or any
of these other things we associate with it.  All I'm saying is that these
things must not consistently constrain our choice to that of a single 
possible action, or if they do, then it is not free-will by MY definition.

Someone else pointed this out too, but you might notice that the "I" always 
refers to the one who is making the argument, but not the argument itself.
There is a difference.

A further and deeper understanding of the nature of reality always takes new
science.  What you are proposing is nothing but the human race's Nth claim
to have absolute knowledge within current science.

So are you claiming that a discussion of orbital chaos is relevant to a

The definition of local in relativity theory IS and ONLY IS:

  s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2,   x, y, z, and t all being real.

All pairs of spacetime points that don't obey this equation have either
a spacelike or a timelike separation and thus by definition are non-local.

Granted that relativity allows the propagation of causality along timelike
paths, but that is because the world-lines of particles that have mass carry
the particles themselves on timelike vectors through 4-space thus producing
the more common-sense form of locality.  A sense of locality that arises 
because particles are essentially changing their spacetime location from our
human perspective.

None of this applies to photons and other particles that travel on light-like
vectors.  For these particles, the definition of locality is the spacetime in-
terval described by the above formula (or some mathematically equivalent form).

This is FALSE.  A locally causal temporally bidirectional microcausality would
allow violation of Bell's inequality just fine.  This temporally bidirectional
microcausality is a standard feature of both Maxwell's equations and is a starting
requirement for all relativistically correct forms of QM even if the details
have yet to be fully worked through.

Nothing needs to be explained.  It is a problem that springs solely from the
fact that our monkey brains have a default definition of locality that is 
neither relativistically accurate nor takes into account the backward in time
principle of advanced-action where it should.

Again, it only seems non-local when one assumes that micro-causality is 
unidirectional with respect to time.

In this we are agreed, we do have a long way to go with this.

Coordinate space?  How 'bout coordinate system?  Do you really want

Hmm...

Now wait a minute.  First of all, non-mathematical readers should be 
warned that "Fourier space" is not a standard mathematical concept.  
Apparently it was freshly minted for the occasion, like my "deity space" 
of a few weeks ago.  One applies a Fourier transform to a function to 
yield another function.  The functions themselves live in a space called a 
Hilbert space.  

You seem to be saying that functions can be separated into equivalence 
classes.  The functions in one equivalence class (or "Fourier space" or 
"waveform family") are interconvertible with other functions in the 
same class, but not with the functions in other classes.  This is news to 
me.  (Which doesn't mean you're wrong; a lot of things are news to me.  
But I think some explanation is called for.)  Any function that satisfies 
the Dirichlet conditions (piecewise continuous and square-integrable) 
can be Fourier-transformed.  Nicht wahr?  And the same sines and 
cosines are used for all functions...  so where do the equivalence classes 
come from?  

As for computers being "hard-wired to the Fourier space defined by 
their RAM's linear address space" -- I have no idea what this means.  

> Software can work around this to some extent, but without

All computers are mathematically equivalent, aren't they?  
One Turing machine can do anything another Turing machine can do.  
Are you referring to the fact that different chips have different 
instruction sets?  What does this have to do with Fourier analysis?  

> The human brain is so flexible because it contains the ability to 
> look at things from radically different viewpoints.  

Well, the essential thing is that the human brain can look at things 
from a viewpoint.  Computers are idiot savants because they have 
no viewpoint.  They have no general model of the world.  They have   
no organs of perception, and no language (in the human sense of 
"language" -- C and Java are not languages in the sense that English  
and Sanskrit are languages).  

Nevertheless, in spite of all this criticism, I think you are onto 
something.  On an intuitive level, I think I see what you are getting at.  
I'm not sure the concept of "Fourier space" can be made rigorous, 
but it is a thought-provoking idea.  

The essential ideas of Fourier analysis are 
(1) Analyzing something into its components.  A function is the sum of   
a series of sines and cosines.  This is analogous to saying that a point 
(x,y,z) in 3-space is the sum of (x,0,0) + (0,y,0) + (0,0,z).  Functions, 
however, require an infinite number of "coordinates".    

(2)  Duality.  Given a function of time, one applies a Fourier transform 
to obtain a function of frequency;  then one applies a transform to this 
function, and the result is... the same function of time that we started 
with.  Thus, functions come in Fourier pairs.  Alternatively, we can say 
that the "same" function exists in the time domain and in the frequency 
domain.  

Now, the instruction set of a chip could be viewed as the "coordinates" 
with which the chip represents problems, and the "Fourier space" would 
be the set of programs that can be (simply or efficiently) written using 
this instruction set -- is that what you mean when you say a computer 
is "hard-wired to a Fourier space"?  If so, I think it's confusing to bring 
Fourier analysis into it.  

Instead of using Fourier analysis as the basis of this whole discussion, 
it would be better to start with a general idea of representing things with 
coordinates, and then Fourier series would be a special case of this -- 
not necessarily the canonical case.

Ok.  Now  your point is getting clearer.  You are conceiving language 
as based on semantic primitives, or coordinates, and the "Fourier space" 
is everything that can be (simply or efficiently) expressed using certain 
coordinates, i.e. a person's basic vocabulary.  Again, I'm not sure that 
trying to base this whole discussion on sines and cosines is the best way 
to proceed.   

But then --

Maybe I should try being a wise elder instead of a cantankerous 
old fart!

Excuse me? Gee now we have leftist conspiracy theorists. I can't
disagree with you more. I would like to hear of ANY qualifications you
may have for you to express and credible opinions on economics.

It sound to me like you graduated from the Castro SChool of Propaganda
and Paranoia.

It is not avoided. It is necessary for the system to work. Operating at
the 7 hz base or other higher harmonic of the Earth, a power transmitter
operates as an RL tank type circuit, which is highly efficient, between
ground and the atmosphere.

This is really rather basic. ANyone who has ever snagged power from a
power line with a coil knows how to do the recieving. The reason why
most EM power transmissions are attenutated over distance is because
they do not resonate with the earth due to their higher frequency.

Anyone who has studied the HARP program knows that this sort of scheme
works. HARP will be useful not only as a communications and remote
sensing device, but could be used in higher power versions to control or
change the weather, or even be used to transmit power as needed.

#1 I haven't heard you state any reasonable alternatives to price
signals.
#2 Who or what's safety is jeopardized by price signals?

#3 Given there are a finite nuber of people on this planet, each with a
finite number of hours in the day to do work, and with a finite level
of  skills, as well as with a finite amount of resources to apply those
skills and hours to to increase or add value, it is obvious that there
would be a finite source of money. To think otherwise would be to risk
the sort of chaotic insanity seen in the "print more if we run out"
attitude of the idiots running formerly communist states like Russia,
who have no concept of rational economic management.

#4 The fact that our money does not need to be tied to  a fixed value of
a resource like gold or silver anymore is evidence that it has attained
value in and of itself as a symbol of productive value of people,
machines, and resources. The actions of the Fed here in the US, and
other national banks elsewhere to maintain the stability of the money
supply is for three reasons: 1) because since cash is mostly in a form
that wears out (the average paper dollar bill has an average life of
less than one year, due to its flimsiness) they need to track its flow
and maintain a healthy supply of said forms of money. 2) Because people
as individuals change their productive and consumptive behavior over
time. 3) Because resources relative scarcity changes over time in
response to the opening and closing of markets and resource bases to
exploitation due to both politics and price signal (for example, due to
the end of the cold war, Russia is now the largest producer and exporter
of petroleum in the world. Adding their resource base in this area has
greatly contributed to the decline in energy costs to what is now the
lowest relative energy resource costs in recorded human history. They
have also contributed to historically low metals prices, and are helping
to make up for the impact of recent lumbering restrictions here in the
US on the market prices for wood products.)

I HIGHLY recommend that you first take a few REAL courses in economics
before you go spouting off about its supposed obsolescence.

[ Notice: I haven't checked the formulas, which appear to be minusculy
  garbled, moreover phi and psi angle symbols have been used
  inconsistantly. However, these points do not at all affect his
  course of argumentation -- 'gene ]

3. Sensorimotor coordination

Let me begin by suggesting that vertically connected laminar structures
are one of evolution's simplest solutions to a crucial type of problem,
one that any sensorimotor system beyond the most rudimentary must
somehow solve. In order to appreciate this type of problem, let us
consider a schematic creature of a deliberately contrived simplicity.

             Figure 2

Figure 2b is a plan view of a crab-like schematic creature (2a) with
two rotatable eyes and an extendable arm. If this equipment is to be
useful to the crab, the crab must embody some functional relationship
between its eye-angle pairs when an edible object is triangulated, and
its subsequent shoulder and elbow angles, so that the arm can assume a
position that makes contact with the edible target. Crudely, it must be
able to to grasp what it sees, wherever the seen object lies.

We can characterize the required arm/eye relationship as follows. First
of all, let us represent the input (the pair of eye angles) by a point
in a two-dimensional sensory-system coordinate space or state space
(figure 3a). The output (the pair of arm angles) can also be represented
by an appropriate point in a separate two-dimensional motor state space
(figure 3a).

     left eye angle \alpha           upper arm angle \theta
      sensory state space              motor state space

We now need a function ot take us from any point in the sensory state
space to a suitable point in the motor state space, a function that will
coordinate arm-position with eye-position in the manner described. (I here
sketch the deduction of the relevant functions so that its origin will not
be a mystery, but the reader may leap past the algebra without any loss of
comprehension. The only point to remember is that we are deducing a suitable
function to take us from eye configurations to arm configurations.)

The two eye angles (a,b) determine two lines that intersect at the seen
object. The coordinates (a,b) of that point (in real) space are given by

    a = -4(tan \alpha + tan \beta)/(tan \alpha - tan \beta)
    b = -8(tan \alpha * tan \beta)/(tan \alpha - tan \beta)

The tip of the arm must make contact with this point. Assuming that both
the forearm and upper arm have a fixed length of seven units, the elbow
will therefore have to lie at the intersection of two circles of radius
seven units: one centered at (a,b), and the other centered at (0,0) where
the upper arm projects from the crab's body. Solving for the relevant
intersection, the real-space elbow coordinates (x_e, y_e) are given by

   x_e = ((49-((a^2+b^2)^2/4b^2)*(1-((a^2/b^2)/
         ((a^2/b^2)+?))))^0.5+(((a/b)*((a^2+b^2)/2b))/
         ((a^2/b^2)+1)^0.5))/((a^2/b^2)+1)^0.5
   y_e = (49-x_e^2)^0.5

The three points in real space, (a,b), (x_e,y_e), (0,0), determine the
position of the arm, whose upper arm and forearm angles (theta, psi) are
finally given by

   theta = tan^-1(y_e/x_e)
   psi   = 180-(\theta-tan^-1((b-y_e)/(a-x_e)))

These are the desired coordinates of the arm in motor state space. The
reader will note that the assembled functions that yield them are rather
tangled ones.

Tangled or not, the crab is drawn on the computer screen, such that its
final arm-position (drawn by the computer as output) is the specified
function of its eye-positions (entered by us as input), it it constitutes
a very effective and well-behaved sensorimotor system, especially if we
write the controlling program as follows.

Let the program hold the crab's arm folded against its chest (at \theta=0,
\psi=180), until some suitable stimulus registers on the fovea of
both eyes. The arm is then moved from its initial state-space position
(0 deg, 180 deg), along a straight line in motor statet space, to its
computed target position in motor state space. This is the state-space
position at which in real space, the tip of the arm contacts the
triangulation point of the eyes. This arrangement produces a superficially
realistic system that reaches unerringly for whatever it sees, anywhere
within reach of its arm (figure 4a-c). [ several multiple-frame computer
renderings of the crab reaching for target omitted ]

The algebraic presentation of the crab's sensorimotor transformation,
as represented in the six equations listed earlier, supplies no intuitive
conception of its overall nature. A geometrical presentation is much more
revealing. Let us therefore consider the projection of the active portion
of the crab's sensory state space (figure 5a) into the orthogonal grid of
its motor state space (figure 5b), as imposed by the function under
discussion. That is to say, for _every_ point in the displayed sensory grid,
we have plotted the corresponding arm-position within the motor grid.

Here we can see at a glance the distortion of the vertical and the
horizontal lines of the sensory space, as projected into motor space. The
topological features of the sensory space are preserved, but its metrical
properties are not. What we see is a systematic transformation of 
coordinates. (The heavy scored triangle and rectangle are drawn in solely 
to help the reader locate corresponding positions in the deformed and the 
undeformed grids. Note also that the left border or \beta-axis of figure 
5a shrinks to the lef radial point in figure 5b, and that the top border 
of figure 5a shrinks to the right radial point in figure 5b.)

4 Coordinate tranformation: its physical implementation.

The tranformation described above sustains effective and realistic
sensorimotor behaviour. But how could a real nervous system possibly
compute such a complex coordinate tranformation? It is not realistic
to expect it to compute this complex trigonometric function step by
step, as our computer simulation does. Nevertheless, given their
sophisticated sensorimotor coordination, biological systems somehow
must be computing transformations like these, and others more complex
still. How might they do it?

Figure 5 suggests a surprisingly simple means. If we suppose that the
crab contains internal representations of both its sensory state space,
and its motor state space, then the following arrangement will effect
the desired tranformation. Let the crab's sensory state space be
represented by a physical grid of signal-carrying fibres, a grid that
is metrically deformed in real space in just the way displayed in figure
5b. Let its motor state space be represented by a second grid of fibres,
in undeformed orthogonal array. Position the first grid over the second,
and let them be connected by a large number of short vertical fibres,
extending from coordinate intersections in the sensory grid down to the
nearest coordinate in the underlying motor grid, as in figure 6.

Suppose that the fibres of the sensory grid receive input from the eyes'
proprioceptive system, such that the position of each eye simulates a
unique fibre in the upper (deformed) grid. The left eye activates one
fibre from the right radial point, and the right eye activates one from
the left. Joint eye-position will thus be represented by a simultaneous
stimulation at the appropriate coordinate intersection in the upper grid.

Underneath this point in the upper map lies a unique intersection in
the motor grid. Suppose that this intersecting pair of orthogonal motor
fibres, when jointly activated, induces the arm to assume the position that
is appropriate to the specific motor coordinate intersection where this
motor signal originates in the lower map.

Happily, the relative metrical deformations in the maps have placed
in correspondence the appropriate points in the upper and lower maps.
We need now suppose only that the vertical connections between the sensory
grid and the motor grid function as "and-gates" or "threshold switches,"
so that a signal is sent down the vertical connection to the motor grid
exactly if the relevant sensory intersection point is simultaneously
stimulated by both of its intersecting sensory fibres. Such a system will
compute the desired coordinate transformations to a degree of accuracy
limited only by the grain of the two grids, and by the density of their
vertical connections. I call such a system a _state-space sandwich_.

Three points are worth noting immediately about the functional properties
of such an arrangement. First, it will remain partially functional despite
localized damage. A small lesion in either grid will produce only a partial
dyskinesia (two permanent "shadows" of fibre inactivity downstream from
the lesion), for which a shift of bodily position will usually compensate
(by bringing the target's state-space position out of the shadow).

Indeed, if the position of the crab's eyes is coded not by the activation
of a single point in the upper grid, but rather by the activation of a
large area (set of points) centered around the 'correct' point, and if the
arm muscles respond by averaging the distributed output signal from the
now multiply-stimulated lower map, than an appropriate motor response will
be forthcoming even if the sandwich has suffered the scattered loss of a
great many cells. Such a system will be functionally persistent despite
widespread cell damage. The quality of the sensorimotor coordination will
be progressively degraded under cell damage, but a roughly appropriate
motor response will still be forthcoming.

Second, the system will be very, very fast, even with fibres of biological
conduction velocities (10 < \nu < 100 m/s). In a creature the size of a crab,
in which the total conduction path is less than 10 cm, this system will yield
a motor response in well under 10 milliseconds. In the crab-simulation
described earlier, my computer (doing its trigonometry within the software)
takes 20 times that interval to produce a motor response on-screen, and its
conduction velocities are on the order of the speed of light. Evidently,
the massively parallel architecture of the state-space sadwich buys a large
advantage in speed, even with vastly slower components.

And third, the quality of of the crab's coordination will not be uniform
over its field of motor activity, since in the maximally deformed areas
of the sensory grid, small errors in sensory registration produce large
errors in the motor respose (see again figure 5b). Accordingly, the crab
is least well coordinated in the area close between its eyes, and to its
extreme right and left.

All three of these functional properties are biologically realistic. And
the sandwich appears biologically realistic in one further respect: it is
relatively easy to imagine such a system being grown. Distinct layers can
confine distinct chemical gradients, and can thus guide distinct 
morphogenetic processes. Accordingly, distinct topographical maps can 
appear in closely adjacent layers. But given that the maps are so closely 
contiguous, and assuming that they are appropriately deformed, the 
problem of connecting them up so as to produce a functional system 
becomes a trivial one: the solution is just to grow conductive elements 
that are roughly orthogonal to the layers.

Different creatures will have different means of locating objects, and
different motor systems to effect contact with them, but all of them will
face the same problem of coordinating positions in their sensory state space
with positions in their motor state space, and the style of solution here
outlined is evidently quite general in nature. The point to be emphasized
is that a state-space sandwich constitutes a simple and biologically 
realistic means for effecting any two-dimensional ot two-dimensional 
coordinate transformation, whatever its mathematical complexity, and 
whatever features -- external or internal, abstract or concrete -- that 
the coordinate axes may represent to the brain. If the transformation can 
be graphed at all, a sandwich can compute it. The sensorimotor problem 
solved above is merely a transparent example of the general technique at 
work.

Switching now from functional to structural considerations, I hope it is
apparent that, beyond the issue of functional realism, the system of
interconnected maps in figure 6 is suggestively similiar to the known
physical structure of typical laminar cortex, including the many topographic
maps distributed across the cerebral surface. In all of these areas, inputs
address a given layer of cells, which layer frequently embodies a metrically
deformed topographic map of something-or-other. And outputs leave the area
from a different layer, with which the first layer enjoys massiver vertical
connections.

I therefore propose the hypothesis that the scattered maps within the 
cerebral cortex, and many subcerebral laminar structures as well, are all 
engaged in the coordinate transformation of points in one neural state 
space into points in another, by the direct interaction of metrically 
deformed, vertically connected topographic maps. Their mode of 
representation is state-space position; their mode of computation is 
coordinate transformation; and both functions are simultaneously 
implemented in a state-space sandwich.

I can cite not a single cerebral area for which this functional hypothesis
is known to be true. To decide the issue would require knowing in some detail
both the topical and te metrical character of the topographic maps in each
of the contiguous laminae that constitute a given area of cerebral cortex.
In general, we still lack such information. However, there is a 
phylogenetically older and simpler laminar structure located on the 
dorsal midbrain whose upper and lower maps have both been decoded, and it 
does display both the structural and the functional patter portrayed in 
figure 6.

The superior colliculus (figure 7) sustains the familiar reflex whereby the
eye makes an involuntary saccade so as to foveate or to look directly at
any sudded change or movement that registers on the retina away from its
central high-resolution area of fovea. e ahve all had the experience of
being in a darkened movie theater when someone down in the front row left
suddenly ignites a match or lighter to light a cigarette. Every eye in the
house makes a ballistic saccade to fixate this brief stimulus, before
returning to the screen. This reflex is the work of the superiour colliculus.
Appropriately enough, this is sometimes called the 'visual grasp reflex.'

No problem whatsoever from *my* philosophical standpoint.

Definition (n):  An explanation intended to convey all information
necessary for the formation of a symbol.

	Our mind contains cognitive objects called 'symbols'.  Nobody knows
where or how they are stored, except that we think the hippocampus
creates them and the cerebellum retrieves them.  'Symbols' generally
have words attached to them, be they auditory or ASL or whatever. 
Symbols are widely thought to be handles to semantic structures,
composed of other semantic primitives such as symbols, and connected by
various semantic links the nature of which is not well understood.
	The network does ground out, because semantic primitives other than
symbols exist.  As a general rule the non-symbolic primitives consist of
either some experiences, or a transformation performed on the current
working memory or visualization, often by attempting to alter the
visualization so that it is analogous to abstracted extracts from
previous experience.
	Classical AIs have no visualizational facilities and their symbols are
all defined in terms of other symbols, which is why classical AI is such
a horrible model of the mind.

I'm using language in the sense of, say, describing whatever Broca's
area does, not in the sense of "programming language" or "encoding". 
Sure, if I transfer visual experiences directly from my occipital lobe
to yours, you could call it "language", but this is torturing the
phrase.  No words, no syntax, no symbols - no language.

As for Damien's point about the "rigorous" thoughts being in English...
did I post my conjecture about the linguistic-semantic cycle here? 
Apparently not.  Well, anyway, from a discussion with someone who
started talking about "models of models of models of self" in the mind:

So yeah, I agree with Damien's statement for humans:  The rigorous
thoughts are in English because it's by hearing those thoughts that we
reason about them, remember them, and fill in the blanks.  But there
could be a better way.  Our future selves may call it the "linguistic
bottleneck" instead of "linguistic self-awareness".

Yes, there is a natural frequency for oscillations of potential 
between the ionosphere and the ground (Schumann Resonance).
No, you can't use it to efficiently transmit power.  The 
ionosphere/ground make a rather lossy waveguide, and the
losses to currents induced in the air/ground/ocean will overwhelm
anything one could pull out with receivers.  A receiver of practical
size would be able to pull very little power out of these 
oscillations.

I do understand the Loonies on KeelyNet say otherwise.

Wait a minute!  There are two Damiens?

THAT explains a whole lot.  Great.  Now I've got to go through all my

HAARP (spell the acronym correctly) uses microwaves to
heat the ionosphere.  Your foaming at the mouth about its uses has
only the vaguest connection to reality.  It has nothing to do with
efficient transmission of power by low frequency waves (indeed,
any ELF it produces by heating of the ionosphere will be nine orders 
of magnitude weaker than earth's background ELF.)  It cannot modify
or control the weather; it can barely affect a limited region of the 
ionosphere (with effects much weaker than natural variability there.)

Lyle,

Thanks for the constructive criticism, so let's see if I can 
answer the points you brought up.

> Coordinate space?  How 'bout coordinate system?  Do you really want
> to put the coordinate systems themselves into a space of their own?

Maybe, maybe not, I really don't know what would be the right way to
frame the semantics on this.  I don't want to misuse existing jargon,
but on the other hand what I am describing has a very definite meaning
which, to say the least, is not widely recognized.

Worse yet, what I'm describing is "intuitively" known in a very poorly
defined way within our culture, leading to a constant confusion between
the perspectives from which a truth may or may not be able to be beheld,
and the actual truth (or lack thereof) itself.  This is an attempt to
define in a more precise way this distinction between truth and perspec-
tive and to ground that distinction in solid mathematical principles.

In any case physicists themselves have also set a precedent in this 
by calling momentum space just that, a space.  I strongly feel that
on this tangent we have a case of physicists not taking their own
theories and descriptions seriously enough.

Yes, and the families can be totally arbitrary as Nick Herbert describes
in pages 82-89 of his book _Quantum Reality_.  The impulse and sine wave
families of classical Fourier analysis are simply those waves that are
kin and conjugate to the Cartesian aspect of reality that we are localized
within.  An infinite number of families are possible, even if only these
two conjugate families seem to be needed for basic Fourier analyis.

This is very true, "Fourier space" is a freshly minted term, I could have
made that more clear in my initial post on this.  Going back to your 
original question, about calling it a space, the Cartesian coordinate
system very clearly defines what we ordinary think of as a space; the
space known more formally in mathematics as the Euclidean space.

Now higher level spaces (like the Hilbert space) do exist in mathematics,
but the problem is that unless we generalize our concept of what a
space is at this lower level we automatically assume that the Euclidean
space has an ontological reality greater than it actually does; thus I
coined the brand new phase "Fourier-space" to reveal how much our fam-
iliar Euclidean space is just an ultimately arbitrary perspective upon
a more general reality no matter how important it is to us locally. 
Again, I strongly feel that this arbitrary perspective is the reason
why QM seems so mysterious in general.

I certainly slipped a cog when writing this by forgetting that a gen-
eralized set of these Fourier spaces is called a Hilbert space.  It's
amazing how I can get so focused on one line of thought that I start
forgetting stuff like this.  It's also true that some mathematical 
techniques especially in the area of matrix math actually deal with 
this beast in a systematic way.  Unfortunately, I've never heard of 
any metaphor that even comes close to allowing us to picture Hilbert
space.  Any one got any ideas?

This is not my meaning.  It's very clear that functions can arbitrarily
be moved from one Fourier space to another, IF one is willing to use an
infinite number of terms.  A quick review of what I actually said:

This is the main point.  The functions might well be totally equivalent, 
but no finite brain is going to solve the problem if it is trying to define
a function in a Fourier-space that requires a near infinite number of terms
to approximate that function well.  What we have here is a very fundamental 
issue regarding the usability of information as a "function" of which 
Fourier-space that infomation is being represented in.

Thus this is a non-issue as my point is not that they can't be
transformed, so much as how many terms will be necessary to effect
an accurate transformation.

IMO, it is simply an error to extend the Turing theorem across the 
boundaries of Fourier-spaces.  A high precision tunable multi-channel
analog processing unit attached to a Apple II with an appropriate
digital to analog control interface, and a fast latching analog to 
digital data readback interface could easily solve in seconds certain 
classes of problems that would give a Cray indigestion for hours at a
time.  Analog computers might be out of fashion for a number of reasons,
but they are immensely powerful in their native realm.  The problem
with "general purpose Turing machines" is that there will always be
classes of problems that any given class of machines will choke on.

Actually I wouldn't expect that, in the limited sense of showing that 
differing Fourier spaces can hold different patterns of information
with varying degrees of ease and localization, there would be any
problem with making this rigorous.

This is not my meaning.  It's not just simply an instruction set issue, since
by hardwired, I mean that the hardware would have built in analog frequency
generators and analog computer logic.  It is my contention that if someone
could solve the practical problems of fusing digital logic with analog logic
into a seamless computational device then we would have machines that would
be qualitatively more intelligent on a wide range of problems.

Ultimately this would lead to a computer that could change, on the fly, the
ratio of digital to analog in its computation so as to surf through the
general set of Fourier spaces to find a concise representation of whatever
problem is at hand.  A process that we might call meta-problem solving.

My hypothesis is that the known physiology of the human brain is that of a 
combined digital and analog device as described above.  A combination that
gives us much flexibility in viewpoint, but can also leave us to talking 
past each other if the people involved can't or won't match viewpoints. 
The relevance of Fourier spaces to this is that formally, this is what 
would be involved when describing the characteristics of this kind of 
digital/analog combination.

I can see that you'd want to take issue with the notion that one
can "engineer" one's values. But I think that if a brainwasher can,
given appropriate control over another person's environment, change
that person's values, then each of us can make deliberate changes
in our own values through self-conditioning. Wanting to have no
desire to smoke tobacco and having no desire to smoke tobacco are
two different things, and I think someone in the first state can,
through deliberate action, transform emself into the second state.
I think this would qualify as a small but deliberate transformation
of one's values. I think larger scale transformations are also
possible.

I'm sure they're not so crudely organized, and given the actual
complexity of human minds, it's not hard for me to see how I could
have a value which actually shapes my immediate actions now (i. e.
"has much influence"), and yet manage to dump that value through
longer-term changes in my own environment and my own behavior.

One of my points is that it's not just one level, nor even just
two levels. There are meta-meta-values above the meta-values. And
even here there's an implicit assumption that the system is
hierarchical, whereas the little bit we know about the brain might

Lojban is a descendant of Loglan, which was invented by James Cooke
Brown in the late 1950's.  A dispute between Brown and some of the
Loglan community led to a schism in which Brown kept possession of
the name Loglan.  The offshoot is named Lojban (pronounced LOAZH-bahn)
but is similar in structure.

The original Loglan was designed with many ambitious goals.  From the
back cover of "Loglan 1, a logical language", the 1975 edition, by Brown:

"Loglan is a language designed to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that
the natural languages limit human thought.  It does so by pushing
those limits outward in predictable directions, principally by..." followed
by a list of features, which are summarized by claims that the language
is "transformationally powerful... metaphysically parsimonious...
syntactically unambiguous... semantically non-restrictive... culturally
neutral".

My personal feeling, based on attempts to learn Loglan, and the
experiences of others that I have read about, is that the language is hard
if not impossible to learn and speak naturally.  A more recent linguistic
theory is Noam Chomsky's idea of universal grammar, which proposes that
all human tongues are constrained by the wiring of the brain to a small
subset of the potentially imaginable languages.  It seems to me that
Loglan (in at least some of its features) may be outside the range of
what the human brain is wired to speak.  In this way it can be a test
of Chomsky's idea as well as Whorf's, and I'd say the preliminary data
favors Chomsky.

If Bell's inequality was derived from Quantum Mechanics then modern Physics 
would be in big trouble because Bell's Inequality is wrong.

Many people including Einstein and Bell himself were unhappy that Quantum 
Mechanics could not make exact predictions, only statistical ones. They were 
even more unhappy about what Einstein contemptuously called "spooky action at 
a distance". They thought that these deficiencies were just caucused by our 
lack of information, hidden variables, and of course they though these  
variables were local.   

So what's the difference between local and non local?  
1) A local force changes with distance and usually diminishes, a non local    
   force has the same strength at one nanometer as it has at 10 billion light    
   years.  
2) A local force acts by the exchange of particles, so if A changes B locally    
   then A must touch B or touch something that does touch B; a non local    
   force jumps directly from A to B without doing anything in-between and so    
   you can't stop it or change it in any way by doing things in the 
   intervening space.  
3) Most important of all, a local force originating at point A can not change    
   anything at point B in less time than it takes for light to travel from    
   A to B, a non local force acts instantly.

Bell's genius was in asking exactly the right question, "Assuming that there  
is such a thing as objective reality, is there anything every conceivable  
local hidden value theory would have in common?". The answer is yes, Bell 
found that even if we are ignorant of important variables, as long as the 
world was local, an inequality he found about the correlation of polarized 
photons was always true. Bell also found that Quantum Mechanics predicted 
that his equality was always false.

If took over 20 years for somebody to convincingly perform the very difficult  
experiment that Bell suggested, but when they did, Bell's inequality was  
violated. This does not prove that Quantum Mechanics is the last word on the  
subject, but it does prove that all local hidden variable theories are wrong.

The first one to test Bell's inequality was John Clauser in 1972. Clauser was 
convinced that the world was local and thought his experiment would prove it; 
he was disappointed when it pointed in the opposite direction.  Clauser's 
experimental method did contain some very small logical loopholes, and those
who were desperate to have a local universe clung to them. Years later when 
Aspect did the experiment he was much more rigorous and the loopholes were 
closed. If there is an objective reality then a local Universe is dead.

You are correct.  It is the violation of Bell's inequality that is derived from
orthodox QM.  I should be more precise in my writings.

It proves no such thing if microcausality is temporally bidirectional, which
is what relativistically correct quantum mechanics tells us anyway.  We really
can't keep ignoring that second order differential equation with respect to
time that is necessary for any relativistically correct formulation of QM.

Well that's a real nice start Eliezer, but you didn't complete it. Talking 
about "a symbol" won't do, I want you to explain "the symbol", after all, 
I didn't ask a general question but a very specific one. So please explain 
all the information necessary for the formation of the symbol  "definition".
          
Actually I cheated, it's foolish to ask for the definition of "definition". 
If you already know then it's a waste of time and if you don't then the  
question is gibberish. Let's suppose you run across a word you've never seen  
before and know nothing about, let's call it "Klognee". I don't think the  
first question you'd want to ask is "what is the klognee of klognee?"
and if I told you the answer it wouldn't be of any help to you.

I'm not sure about it's uses as a mode of power transmission, but HAARP
technology may 
be a route to weather control. With a few major breakthoughs in power
amplification, we might see some small effects such as screwing with the
local climate. The DoD has openly admitted that they're pumping dough into
the area of weather control which explains why they have their mitts it
HAARP. Even Popular Science suggested HAARP as a possible route to weather
control. I myself think weather control will come long before decent
weather prediction. With predicting the weather you have to watch, wait,
and look at all the little details to predict where moisture and such is
going to move. With weather control all you need to do is heat up sections
of the atmosphere accordingly to FORCE the system to put out what you want.
It's cruder and insensitive to the ecosystem but it works which is why
military would use it.

I am now wondering whether this technique similar to or different from 
a technique used by persons in interdisciplinary fields who utilize 
research from various systems of research.  It's difficult for me to 
describe, but when one is drawing together research from various 
fields, there is a sort of mental juggling act wherein one must 
evaluate each piece of research within the context and the methodology 
under which it was conducted, and simultaneously bring those pieces 
together into a coherent connecting concept.  Maybe I am describing 
parallel processing, because there is a sensation of shifting back 
and forth between two tracks of thought, but conceptually I tend to
view it as a fractal construction.

Yes, no, maybe?

By the way, the email facility provided by Outlook97 (part of Microsoft 
Office97) automatically reformats received messages to restore the unbroken 
paragraph look.  It also does a few more neat tricks such as highlighting 
email addresses and URLs (URL's?) to make them clickable.  However one 
feature not yet provided is the ability to display HTML encoding.

Another feature worth mentioning is that saved messages can be assigned 
multiple keywords for grouping and retrieval.  This solves the problem of 
where to file a message that belongs to multiple categories.

Overall a nice package in my opinion.

I think it's a bit misleading, quoting only my quickie definition:
> >Definition (n):  An explanation intended to convey all information        
> >necessary for the formation of a symbol.

You should at least note that this was the summary only and that I also
included an explanation of all the cognitive objects associated with
"explanation", "information", "formation", and "symbol".  This
explanation was in turn the information necessary for the formation of
the symbol "definition", as you say.

I could also point to the subjective aspect of watching something being
defined, and that would also be sufficient for defining the symbol
"definition".  It would not, however, reduce the term "definition" to
its causal constituents but instead ask you to accept the experiential
aspect of definition as a conceptual primitive, which I deemed an unfair
"out" - even though definition actually *is* a conceptual primitive, we
can still attach a scientific explanation to our experience of that
primitive.

In other words, pointing to the subjective aspect would indeed define
the symbol of "definition" and give it a referent, but not the
*explanatory* (rather than experiential) referent you were looking for.

So my answer is, I did explain all the information necessary for the
formation of the symbol "definition".  I gave a detailed description of
all the cognitive events associated with defining something.  Of
*course* the quickie definition is circular:  It uses the phrase
"formation of a symbol", which unless defined further, simply means:
"defining a symbol".  The only way to break this circularity is to point
to the cognitive processes involved in symbol formation, which can be
defined (presumably) in terms of basic Turing processes.  Now, *those*
you can't define except circularly.

In any case, it strikes me as being a straw-man switch to call the
summary "circular" and ignore the three paragraphs of cognitive science.

It seems like that whatever we call it, it appears more and more to be
a fundamental skill of some kind.  Thanks for your contribution, as I 
feel that this is going to lead us to "pay-dirt" within the field of
memetics.

Hardly. Unless we are talking megaengineering, the weather contains so
large amounts of energy that it would be very costly and inefficient to
force the system in the direction you want - a cubic kilometer of air
moving at the leisurely pace of 1 m/s would contain 5*10^8 J of just
kinetic energy. 

What you can do is of course physical juijitsu - redirect the energy 
slightly in an useful manner and let physics take its course. This is 
how control of chaotic systems work, and it seems to me that the only 
workable large scale weather control methods would be based on nudging 
the weather into the right attractor instead of trying to force it there 
(which is bound to cause chaotic oscilliations and other trouble). 
Managing microclimate is another thing (I like Daedalus suggestion about 
using microwaves to force rain from clouds to keep them away from certain 
areas). 

This relates to weather prediction, of course. The reason we can't 
predict the weather well is that it is too chaotic. Even if we did get 
enough sensors to keep track of it on a quite local scale it would still 
surprise us after a while; judging from the lyapunov exponents I have 
heard of detailled predictions beyond a week are simply not possible 
unless you place several sensors in every cubic kilometer.

Chaotic dynamics is both our friend and foe; fortunately we can use its 
capriciousness.

I interpret that as meaning

Correct me if you can.

Perhaps at high enough energies, but not in the cold depths of the present...

A "being" moving at lightspeed would perceive an universe with just a
single moment of time and 2 spatial dimensions; spacetime would be beyond
its observation capabilities (after all, it has just a single moment to
exist), but it doesn't mean that the universe is a single point (if it
was, how come I'm not telling you this face to face?). 

Lightlike paths are null geodesics, paths of zero length that crisscross
the spacetime. In some sense they form a scaffolding for the rest of
reality where distances are nonzero.

Hold it right there!  

1) The price system doesn't "use instrumental value",the price system *
is* the subjective estimate of instrumental value on the part of the
millions of participants in the economic system.  This vast, complex
process of estimation by everyone is distilled in the price of any given
item facing your choice.  And the choice you make on whether to buy or
not is based on your subjective estimate (informed guess)  of the item's
instrumental value to you in the context of your relative scale of values.
If the item satisfies your expectations you buy another, or testify
positively, if it doesn't you don't, or testify negatively .  So your (
and everyone else's) economic choices affect every  item in the economy,
influencing what is produced, where and when.  In this way, the price
system gradually*discovers* the objective instrumental values of things.

2)   What the fuck is "intrinsic value"?  How is it  to be estimated?

[ Figure 7 legend:
 a) Projections drawing of Nissl-stained cross-section of cat superiour
 colliculus illustrating laminar organization. Dots correspond to
 collicular neurons. From Kanasecki and Sprague (1974). Reprinted
 with permission.
 b) Retinotopic map: a metrically deformed topographic map of the
 visual hemifield, in rectangular coordinates, on the superficial
 layer of the right colliculus of the cat. M = medial; L = lateral;
 A = anterior; P = posterior. Adapted from Schiller (1984).]

In humans and the higher mammals the superior colliculus is a
visual center secondary to the more important striate cortex
(areas 17 and 18 on the Brodmann map) located at the rear of the
cerebral hemispheres, but in lower animals such as the frog and
snake, which lack any significant cortex, the superior colliculus
(or optic tectum, as it is called in them) is their principal
visual center. It is an important center even for mammals, however,
and it works roughly as follows.

The top-most layer of the superior colliculus (hereafter, SC)
receives projections directly from the retina, and it constitutes
a metrically-deformed topographic map of the retinal surface (figure
7b) [...]. Vertical elements connect this layer to the deepest layer
of the SC. These vertical connections appear to consist of a chain
of two or three short interneurons descending stepwise through two
intervening layers [...], of which more later. Also, the dendrites
of some of the deep-layer neurons appear to ascend directly into
the visual layer, to make synaptic connections with visual cells
[...]. The neurons of the deepest layer project their output axons
via two distinct nervous pathways, one of which leads eventually to
the pair of extra-ocular muscles responsible for horizontal eye
movements [...].

Intriguingly, this underlying motor layer also embodies a topographic
map, a map of state space that represents changes in the contractile
position of the ocular muscles, the muscles that make the eye jump
[...]. Microstimulation by an electrode at any given point in this
deepest layer causes the eyes to execute a saccade of a size and
direction characterisitic for that point, a saccade which moves
the eye's fovea into the position originally occupied by that retinal
cells which projects to the immediately overlying cell in the
top-most layer of the colliculus [...]. In other words, the relative
metrical deformations in the two maps have placed into correspondence
the appropriate points in the upper and lower maps. (This means
that the "deformation" seen in figure 7b should not of itself
be taken as evidence for the state-space sandwich hypothesis. What
is crucial is the deformation of the maps relative to each other.)

Finally, any sufficiently strong retinally produced stimulation
in that top-most visual map is conveyed downwards to the motor map
by the appropriate vertical elements, where it produces a saccade
of just the size and direction appropriate for the foveation of the
external stimulus that provoked it. The SC thus appears to be an
instance of both the structural and the functional pattern displayed
in figure 6. It foveates on changing or moving visual targets by
essentially the same means whereby the schematic cortex of the crab
reaches out for triangulated objects.

A word of caution is in order here, since the account just offered
does not do justice to the full complexity of the superior
colliculus. In mammals, especially the higher mammals, the SC is
a tightly integrated part of a larger modulating system that
includes inputs from the visual cortex and the frontal eye fields,
and output to the neck muscles. The functional properties of the
entire system are more varied and more subtle than the preceding
suggests, and the job of sorting them out is still underway [...].
The preceding is submitted as an account of the central or more
primitive functions of the SC, at best.

With these examples in mind -- the crab's "cortex," and the
superior colliculus -- it is appropriate to focus on the many
other topographically-organized multilayered cortical areas
scattered throughout the brain, and ask what coordinate
transformation they might be effecting. Here it is very important
to appreciate that the topographic maps we seek to decode need
not be, and generally will not be, maps of something anatomically
obvious, such as the surface of the retina, or the surface of
the skin. More often they will be maps of some abstract state
space, whose dimensional significance is likely to be opaque
to the casual observer, though of great functional importance to
the brain. Two pretty examples of such abstract maps are the
map of the echo delays in the bat's auditory cortex, and the
map of binaural disparities in the owl's inferior colliculus
[...].

All of this suggests that the brain may boast many more topographic
maps that have so far been identified, or even suspected.
Certainly the brain has a teeming abundance of topographically
organized areas, and recent work has expanded the number of
known sensory-related maps considerably [...]. All of this further
suggests that we will make better progress in trying to understand
the significance of the many topographically-organized cortical
areas when we approach them as maps of abstract but functionally
relevant state spaces.

5 Cortex with more than two layers

While we are discussing the biological reality of the laminar
mechanism proposed, consider the objection that our modl cortex
has only two layers, whereas the typical human cortex has six
layers, and, counting fine subdivisions, perhaps eight or nine
in some areas. What are they for?

There is no difficulty in perceiving a function for such additional
layers. Let us return to again to the superior colliculus, which
illustrates one of many possibilities here. Between the visual and
the motor maps of the SC there are, in some creatures, onee or
two intermediate layers (see again figure 7). These appear to
constitute an auditory map and/or a somatosensory map (a facial or
whisker map), whose function is again to orient the eye's fovea,
this time toward the source of sudden auditory and/or somatosensory
stimulation [...]. Not surprisingly, these intervening maps are
each metrically deformed in such a fashion as to be in rough
coordinate "register" with the motor map, and hence with each other.
Altogether, this elegant three- or four-layer topographic sandwich
constitutes a multimodal sensorimotor coordinate transformer.

Multilayered structures have further virtues. It is plain that
maps of several distinct modalities, suitably deformed and placed
in collective register within a "club sandwich," provide a most
effective means of cross-modal integration and comparison. In the
SC, for example, this multimodal arrangement is appropriate in the
production of a motor response to the joint receipt of faint but
spatiotemporally coincident auditory and visual stimuli, stimuli
which, in isolation, would have been subthreshold for a motor
response. For example, a faint sound from a certain compass point
may be too faint to prompt the eyes into a foveating saccade, and
a tiny movement from a certain compass point may be similiarly
impotent; but if both the sound and movement come from the same
compass point (and are thus coded in the SC along the same vertical
axis), then their simultaneouos conjunction will indeed be sufficient
to make the motor layer direct the eyes appropriately. This
prediction is strongly corroborated by the recent results of Meredith
and Stein (1095).

Further exploration reveals that multilayered sandwiches can subserve
decidedly sophisticated cognitive functions. In an earlier publication
[...], I have shown how a three-layer state-space sandwich can code,
and project, the path of a _moving_ object in such a fashion as to
position the crab's arm to catch the moving target on the fly.
Evidently, a multilayered cortex can offer considerable advantages.

6 Beyond state-space sandwiches

The examples studied above are uniform in having an input state
space of only two dimensions, and an output state space of only
two dimensions. It is because of this fact that the required
coordinate transformation can be achieved by a contiguous pair
of sheet like maps. But what of cases where the subsystems involved
each have more than two parameters? What of cases where the
coordinate transformations are from an input spac of n to an
output space of m dimensions, where n and m are different, and
both greater than 2? Consider, for example, the problem of
coordinating the joint angles of a limb with three or more
joints, and the problem of coordinating several such limbs with
each other. Or consider the problem of coordinating the even
larger number of muscles that collectively control such limbs.
As soon as one examines the problems routinely faced, and solved,
by real creatures, one appreciates that many of them are far
more complex than can be represented by simple two-dimensions
to two-dimensions transformation.

Perhaps some of these more complex problems might be solved
by dividing them into a set of smaller ones, problems that
can be managed after all by a set of distinct two-dimensional
state-space sandwiches, each addressing some slice or
aspect of the larger problem [...]. The predominance of
laminar cortex in the brain certainly encourages speculation
along these lines. But such solutions, even approximate ones,
cannot in general be guaranteed. The brain badly needs some
mechanism beyond the state-space sandwich if it is routinely
to handle these higher dimensional problems.

Andras Pellionisz and Rodolfo Llinas [...] have already
outlined a mechanism adequate to the task, and have found
impressive evidence of its implementation within the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is the large structure at the
rear of the brain, just underneath the cerebral hemispheres.
Its principal function, divined initially from lesion studies,
is the coordination of complex bodily movements, such as
would be displayed in in preparing a dinner or in playing
basketball. It displays a neural organization quite different
from that of the cerebral hemispheres, an organization whose
significance may be rendered transparent by the Pellionicz/
Llinas account.

To illustrate this more general mechanism for coordinate
transformation, let us consider an input system of four dimensions
whose inputs a, b, c, d, are transformed into the values x, y, z
of a three-dimensional output system. As before, the outputs
and inputs are can each be regarded as points in a suitable
state space. Since they are n-tuples, each can also be regarded
as a vector (whose base lies at the origin of the relevant
state space, and whose arrowhead lies at the point specified
by the n-tuple).

            Purkinje cell output

            Figure 9

A standard mathematical operation for the systematic transformation
of vectors into vectors is matrix multiplication. Here it is the
matrix that embodies or effects the desired coordinate transformation.
To see how this works, consider the matrix of figur 8, which has four
rows and three columns. To multiply the input vector <a,b,c,d> by this
matrix we multiply a times p_1, b times p_2, c times p_3, d times p_4,
and then sum the four results to yield x. We then repeat the process
with the second column to yield y, and again with the third column to
yield z. Thus results the output vectors <x,y,z>. [of course matrixmult
is but a narrow example of a generic mapping, which can be written as
a table -- 'gene ]

This algebraic operation can be physically realized quite simply by
the neural array of figure 9. The parallel input fibres at the right
each send a train of electrochemical "spikes" towards the waiting
dendritic trees. The numbers a, b, c, d represent the amount by which
the momentary spiking frequency of each of the four fibres is above

[ Figure 10 Schematic section: cerebellum is omitted due to ascii art
  limitations. You see lots of treelike Purkinje cells (sprouting
  synapses on tree branches) reaching into a thick slab of parallel
  fibres. Some granular cells (below the Purkinjes) generate some
  of the input of the parallel fibres. (Well, a picture _is_ worth
  a 1 kWord ]

(positive number) or below (negative number) a certain baseline
spiking frequency. The top-most input fibre, for example, synapses
into each of the three output cells, making a stimulating connection
in each case, one that tends to depolarize the cell body and make
it send a spike down its vertical output axon. The output frequency
of spike emissions for each cell is determined first by the simple
_frequency_ of the input stimulations it receives from all incoming
synaptic connections, and second, by the _weight_ or strength of
each synaptic connection, which is determined by the placement of
the synapses and by their cross-sectional areas. These strength
values are individually represented by the coefficients of the
matrix of figure 8. The neural interconnectivity thus implements
the matrix. Each of the three cells of figure 9 "sums" the
stimulation it receives, and emits an appropriate train of spikes
down its output axon. Those three output frequences differ from
the background or baseline frequencies of the three output cells
by positive or negative amounts, and these amounts correspond to
the output vector <x,y,z>.

Note that with state-space sandwiches, the coding of information
is a matter of the spatial location of neural events. By contrast,
with the matrix-multiplication style of computation under
discussion, input and output variables are coded by sets of spiking
frequencies in the relevant pathways. The former system uses
"spatial coding"; the latter system used "frequency coding." But
both systems are engaged in the coordinate transformation of
state-space positions.

The example of figure 9 concerns a tree-by-four matrix. But it is
evident that neither the mathematical operation nor its physical
realization suffers any dimensional limitations. In principle,
a Pellionisz/Llinas connectivity matrix can effect transformations
on state spaces of a dimensionality into thousands and beyond.

The schematic archetecture of figure 9 corresponds very closely
to the style of microorganization found in the cerebellum
(figure 10). [...]. The horizontal fibres are called parallel fibres,
and they input from the higher motor centres. The bushy vertical
cells are called Purkinje cells, and they output through the
cerebellar nucleus to the motor periphery. In fact, it was from
the observation of the cerebellum's beautifully regular architecture,
and from the attempt to recreate its functional properties by
modelling its large-scale physical connectivity within a computer,
that Pellionisz and Llinas were originally led to the view that
the cerebellum's job is the systematic transformation of vectors
in one neural hyperspace into vectors in another neural hyperspace
[...].

Given that view of the problem, the tensor calculus emerges as
the natural framework with which to address such matters, especially
since we cannot expect the brain to limit itself to Cartesian
coordinates. In the examples discussed so far, variation in
position along any axis of the relevant state space is independent
of variation along any of the other axes, but this independence
will not characterize state spaces with nonorthogonal axes. Indeed,
the generalization of the approach, to include non-Cartesian
hyperspaces, is regarded by Pellionicz and Llinas as one of the
most important features of their account, a feature that is
essential to understanding all but the simplest coordination
problem. I cannot pursue this feature here.

Four final points about the neural matrix of figure 9. First, it
need not be limited to computing linear transformations. The
individual synaptic connections might represent any of a broad
range of functional properties. They do not need be simple
multipliers. In concert then, they are capable of computing
a large variety of non-linear transformations. Second, a neural
matrix will have the same extraordinarily speed displayed by
a state-space sandwich. And third, given a great many components,
such matrices will also display a fierce functional persistence
despite the scattered loss of their cellular components.

Finaally, such systems can be plastic in the transformations they
effect: changes in the weights and/or numbers of the synaptic
connections are all that is required. What is problematic is how
a useful set of weights, i.e. a set that effects a transformation
useful to the organism, gets established in the first place. How
does the matrix 'learn' ot implement the right transformation?

The problem is certainly solvable in principle. The 'back-
propagation' learning algorithm of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams
(1986) has shown that distributed processors of this general
type can learn with extraordinary efficiency, given a suitable
regime for propagating discovered error back through the
elements of the system. And it may be solvable in fact, since
the cerebellar network does contain a second input system: the
climbing fibres (not shown in figures 9 and 10 for reasons of
clarity). These ascend from below each of the Purkinje cell
and wrap themselves like vines around the branches of its
dendritic tree. They are thus in a position to have a direct
effect on the nature of the synapses made by the parallel
fibres onto the Purkinje dendrites. According to a recent model
by Pellionicz and Llinas (1985), the cerebellum can indeed
become 'coordinated' by essentially this method.

These brief remarks do not do justice to the very extensive work
of Pellionicz and Llinas, nor have I explored any criticism.
[...]. The reader must turn to the literature for deeper
instruction. The principal lesson of this section is that the
general functional schema being advanced here -- the schema
of representation by state-space position, and computation
by coordinate transformation -- does not encounter
implementational difficulties when te representational and
computational task exceeds the case of two dimensions. On the
contrary, the brain boasts neural machinery that is ideally
suited to cases of very high dimensionality. We have then
at least two known brain mechanisms for performing coordinate
transformations: the state-space sandwich specifically for the
two-dimensional cases, and the neural matrix for cases of
any dimensionality whatsoever.

Yes, photons come in, but nothing is sent to your brain so it's useless.

Hi.  I'm about 90 days backlogged in reading the list but I had a thought
you might like.  (I feel like that character who only communicated by
(virtual) teletype in the dungeons-and-dragons world of Vinge's _True
Names_.  The UPS guys would deliver this teletype to the Castle...
was it THE POSTMAN?)

I like to wonder how AI might arise from software development efforts
going on right now.  Also, I wonder how we might give AIs the qualities
we want them to have.

Maybe AIs will come about as assemblies of pieces of software that all
do sensible jobs that we understand: indexing, modeling, taking statistics
and making predictions, parsing and composing sentences, keeping schedules,
etc.

Maybe the personalities of these AIs will have a lot to do with the
personalities of the components.  You know what I mean.  Every piece of
software has some sort of personality.  We notice whether
software is easy or hard, fun or boring, straightforward or devious,
dependable or flakey or downright infuriating...

If the personality of AI is going to flow from the personalities of its
components, that's scary, because a lot of software these days is nasty
and badly behaved.  I spend a lot of time trying to deal with software that
seems to be written by people who have no respect for me, my time, my
sanity, my need to understand, or my peace of mind.  People who seem not
to take responsibility for the context in which their software is going
to be used.  These attitudes seem implicit in the behavior of software.
For instance, I install a new version of my OS and the TCP settings are
toast, and the new control panel doesn't make sense.  Or it fails with a
completely uninformative and patently absurd message, with no clue where
to go from there. I call up the help wizzard and it says, "Put your
DNS server address here," indicating a section of a form that has no
blanks to fill in.  (This is Mac System 7.5.5's Guide on the TCP/IP
control panel.  A really beautiful animation of drawing a red crayon
circle in an empty white space, including showing through the translucent
help box.)

I'm not so much complaining about the present as fearing for the future:
imagine an AI with all the worst personality flaws of the latest
releases from your favorite software companies.  Larry Ellison and
Bill Gates on chips, or downloading intently into your WebTV.  You get home
and you your house has been upgraded with a butler that's like Word 6.

Subject: 	Memes and Conspiracy

	I have been reading your book, Virus of the Mind, and was pleased
to see your section "conspiracy theories".  Now, my associate James
Daugherty tells me you are on the Extropian list.  Both James and I are
quite impressed with the Extropians.

	Many years ago before I had even heard of memes I came up with the
idea that "Conspiracy theory is a heurism for social organism theory",
meaning that most "conspiracies" are really "macrobes" or "social
organisms" controlled and unified by what I then called "idea cement".
Yah, I know, I invented the word "heurism" to mean a learning device, in
this case, leading to social organism theory.  Anyway, what I was getting
at is a way of explaining how most members of a "conspiracy" are
unconscious of the overall goals of their social organism yet act in a
co-ordinated fashion to achieve the goals of the organism.

	Perhaps I should finish reading your book before I say this, but,
in my opinion, memeticians are failing to take seriously that memes are to
social organisms or macrobes as genes are to biological organisms.
Ultimately, memes survive because they impart characteristics to their
macrobe that enhance survival of the macrobe just as genes impart survival
characteristics to biological organisms.  Memeticians seem to fall into
the view that memes compete directly with each other....like a catchy
virus.  Yup, we probably have a big disagreement on this one, judging from
the title of your book.

	As an aside, I see no reason why especially well developed
macrobes might not be "conscious" in the same way that well developed
biological organisms seem to be "conscious".  Note that in both cases
consciousness would be independent of any cell or individual, a not well
understood property of a complex organism.

	Another aside:  The focus on the possibility a "one world" macrobe, Gaia,
has diverted attention from the much better developed power organism more
available for study:  The major world religions, power establishments,
etc.

7 The representational power of state spaces

Discussion so far has been concentrated on the impressive
computational power of coordinate transformations of state spaces,
and on the possible neural implementation of such activity. But it
is important to appreciate fully the equally powerful representational
capacity of neural state spaces. A global circumstance comprised of n
distinct varables can be economically represented by a single point in
an abstract n-dimensional state space. And such a state-space point
can be neurally implemented, in the simplest case, by a specific
distribution of n spiking frequencies in a system of only n distinct
fibres. Moreover, a state-space representation embodies the metrical
relations between distinct possible positions within it, and thus
embodies the representation of _similiarity_ relations between
distinct items thus represented. These claims can be illustrated by
the outputs of several of our sensory organs.

Consider first a simple case: the human gustatory system has a four-
channel output, with each of the four pathways representing the level
of stimulation at one of the four sets of taste sensors in the mouth,
the so-called sweet, sour, salty, and bitter receptors. Any humanly
possible taste sensation, it is therefore conjectured, is a point
somewhere within a four-dimensional gustatory state space. Or more
literally, it is a quadruple of spiking frequencies in the four
proprietary pathways carrying information from the gustatory
receptors for distribution to the rest of the brain. [ wish I had
a GC/MS combo for input instead, also takes care of the olfaction
-- 'gene]

A sweet taste, for example, is coded as a specific set of activity
levels across the four pathways (a high value on one, and a low
value on each on the other three). Other combinations of activity
levels yield all of the taste sensations possible for humans. The
qualitative or subjective similiarity of sensations emerges, both
theoretically and experimentally, as the proximity of the relevant
codings within gustatory state-space.

Such a coding system also gives us an enormous range of
discrimination at a very low price. Just to illustrate the point,
suppose our discrimination of distinct positions (activity levels)
along each of the four axes of gustatory state space is limited
to just ten positions. This gives us an overall four-dimensional
space with fully 10^4 discriminable points. This state-space
approach to gustatory sensations appears in the neuroscience
literature as the _across-fibre pattern_ theory [...].

An account of this same general kind may old four our olfactory
system, which has six or more distinct types of receptor. A six-
dimensional space, at 10-unit axial discrimination, will permit
the discrimination of 10^6 odors. And if we imagine only a seven-
dimensional olfactory space, with only three times the human
axial discrimination, which space a dog almost certainly possesses,
then we are contemplating a state space with 30^7, or 22 billion,
discriminable positions! Given this, the canines' ability to
distinguish, by smell, any one of the 3.5 billion people on the
planet no longer presents itself as a mystery.

Consider the human 'module' for facial recognition. We apparently
have one, since the specific ability to recognize faces can be
destroyed by specific right parietal lesions. Here it is plausible
to suggest an internal state-space representation of perhaps
twenty dimensions, each coding some salient facial feature such
as nose length, facial width, and so on. (Police 'Identikits'
attempt to exploit such a system, with some success.) Even if
discrimination along each axis were limited to only five distinct
positions such a high-dimensional space would still have an enormous
volume (=5^20 positions), and it would permit the discrimination
and recognition of billions of distinct faces. It would also
embody similiarity relations, so that close relatives could be
successfully grouped, and so that the same person could be
reidentified in photos taken at different ages. Consider two photos
of the young and the old Einstein. What makes them similiar?
They occupy approximate positions in one's facial state space.

Finally, let us turn to a motor example, and let us consider
one's "body image": one's continuously updated sense of one's
overall bodily configuration in space. That configuration is
constituted by the simultaneous position and tension of several
hundreds of muscles, and one monitors it all quite successfully,
to judge from the smooth coordination of most of one's movements.
How does one do it? With a high-dimensional state space,
according to the theories of Pellionicz and Llinas, who ascribe
to the cerebellum the job of computing appropriate transformations
among high-dimensional codings of actual and intended motor
circumstances, codings lodged in the input parallel fibers and
the output Purkinje axons.

[Figure 11: a) Step cycle: feline hind leg. b) Skeletal state
space [Roughly, you see an eadweard muybridge of a stylized
cat's hind limb during one full stride cycle, and an according
scimitar-shaped closed trajectory loop in the joint-angle
space spanned by the hip, knee, ankle angles]]

Some of the possibilities here can be evoked by a very simple
example. Consider a highly complex and critically orchestrated
periodic motion, such as occurs in feline locomotor activity
(Figure 11a). Consider now a three-dimensional joint-angle
motor space for the cat's hind limb, a space in which every
possible configuration of that limb is represented by a point,
and every possible movement is represented by a continuous
path. The graceful step cycle of the galloping cat will be
very economically represented by a closed loop in that joint-
angle state space (figure 11b). If the relevant loop is
specified or "marked" in some way, then the awesome task of
coordinated locomotion reduces to a clear-cut tracking problem:
make your motor state-space position follow the path of that
loop. [ now why must I constantly think of robotics when I
read this passage? Inaudible gliding of position feedback
sensors, hum of motors, digitally homeostased by the dedicated
circuitry containing and executing the binary pattern, the
control automaton network -- 'gene]

Once we have taken the step beyond the coginitiv significance
of points in two-dimensional state space to the cognitive
significance of lines and closed loops in n-dimensional state
spaces, it seems possible that we will also find cognitive
significance in surfaces, and hypersurfaces, and intersection
of hypersurfaces, and so forth. What we have opening before us
is a "geometrical," as opposed to a narrowly syntactic, conception
of cognitive activity.

8 Concluding remarks

We have seen how a representation scheme of this kind can account,
in a biologically realistic fashion, for a number of important
features of motor control, sensory discrimination, and sensorimotor
coordination. But has it the resources to account for the so-called
higher cognitive activities, as represented by language use, for
example, and by our propositional knowledge of the world in general?

Conceivably, yes. One might try to find, for example, a way of
representing "anglophone linguistic hyperspace" so that all
grammatical sentences turn out to reside on a proprietary
hypersurface within that hyperspace, with the logical relations
between them reflected as spatial relations of some kind. I do
not know how to do this, of course, but it holds out the
possibility of a alternative to, or potential reduction of,
the familiar Chomskyan picture.

As for the "set of beliefs" that is commonly supposed to constitute
a person's knowledge, it may be that a geometrical representation
of sentences will allow us to solve the severe problem of "tacit
belief" [...]. Just as a hologram does not "contain" a large
number of distinct three-dimensional images, curiously arranged
so as to present a smoothly changing picture of a real object
as the hologram is viewed from different positions, so may humans
not "contain" a large number of distinct beliefs, curiously arranged
so as collectively to present a coherent account of the world.

Perhaps the truth is rather that, in both cases, a specific image
or belief is just an arbitrary projection or "slice" of a deeper set
of data structures, and the collective coherence of such sample
slices is a simple consequence of the manner in which the global
information is stored at the deeper level. It is not a consequence
of, for example, the busywork of some fussy inductive machine
applying inductive rules for the acceptance or rejection of discrete
slices taken singly. Which means that, to understand learning, we
may have to understand the forces that dictate directly the evolution
of the global data structures at the deeper level. The learning
algorithm of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams comes to mind again
here, for in a network of that sort no symbols of any kind are being
manipulated. Rather, in the course of a training session a function
is progressively approximated, and the information the network
acquires is stored in nothing more contentful than a distributed
set of synapse-like weights.

These highly speculative remarks illustrate one direction of
research suggested by the theory outlined in this paper: just what
are the abstract representational and computational capacities
of a system of state spaces interacting of coordinate transformations?
Can we use a system of state spaces to articulate models for the
"higher" forms of cognitive activity? The theory also begs research
in the opposite direction, towards the neurophysiology of the brain.
Given that the brain is definitely not a "general purpose" machine
in the way that a digital computer is, it may often turn out that,
once we are primed to see them, the brain's localized computational
tactics can simply be read off its microstructure. There is point,
therefore, to studying that microstructure [...].

Taken jointly, the prodigious representational and computational
capacities of a system of state spaces interacting by coordinate
transformations suggest a powerful and highly general means of
understanding the cognitive activities of the nervous system,
especially since the physical mechanisms appropriate to implement
such a system are widespread throughout the brain.

No. First, HAARP affects the ionosphere.  The ionosphere
has no direct effect on the weather.  Second, the energy being put 
into the ionosphere by the Sun is very much larger than would be
practical for humanity to inject.

The HAARP site has this to say about weather modification:

(from http://server5550.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects/haarp/faq.html )

-------

Is HAARP capable of affecting the weather?

The HAARP facility will not affect the stratosphere and climate. 
Transmitted energy in the frequency ranges that will be used
by HAARP, is subject to negligible absorption in either the 
troposphere or the stratosphere - the two levels of the atmosphere
which produce the earth's weather. Electromagnetic interactions
only occur in the rarefied region above about 70 km known as
the ionosphere.

The ionosphere is created and continuously replenished as the
sun's radiation interacts with the highest levels of the Earth's
atmosphere. The downward coupling from the ionosphere to the
stratosphere/troposphere is extremely weak, and no association
between natural ionospheric variability and surface weather and
climate has been found, even at the extraordinarily high levels of
ionospheric turbulence that the sun can produce during a geomagnetic
storm. If the ionospheric storms caused by the sun itself don't 
affect the surface weather, there is no chance that HAARP can do
so either.

A reasonable immune system would consist of "bone marrow units" that
produce immune nanites ("blue goo") and distributes them, and "lymph
units" that integrate their information. The "bone marrow" would mutate
and evolve new kinds of immune nanites as needed (controlled by
information from the "lymph units"; <Nanite species 67267247 only 3%

What worries me is that it is not unreasonable to build a nanite that
converts organic compounds into diamondoid, but normal life cannot convert
diamondoid into organics (I think; there might be some bacterium who does
this). This means that over time unchecked nanite spread *could* lock
Earth into a diamondoid ecology instead. Waves of grey goo eating the
Earth are unlikely, but a "golden goo" disaster where some nanite
accidentally upsets biology on a large scale is possible (like a cell
medical nanite that starts hunting *all* bacteria and replicates in
nature).  That is why we need to have immune systems that are flexible and
general *before* the nanites get loose in the biosphere (eventually, they
will). Its main use might not be to defend against attacks from enemies 
but to remove nonfunctional nanites (<Remove species 3476347>).

Actually, making a nanite that could thrive in nature would be tricky. 
UV, oxygen, a very non-standard environment and possibly competition from 
bacteria.

Let's see, I am sure we will have a few KQb quite soon. I bet it will be
interesting, possibly useful but not lauch us into the singularity the
night after the laboratory prototype works. Just because you can design
proteins well doesn't mean nanotech and SI will appear next tuesday. Of

Yes, it is both reversible and could possibly become very dense. The 
question is how long the coherence times and lengths can be made; the 
last results suggest several minutes at least.

There exists another fun calculation that allows you to find the x:th
digit of pi in O(something small) without calculating the previous d-1
digits, this has been used to calculate the ten billionth digit of pi; see
http://www.mathsoft.com/asolve/plouffe/plouffe.html

I wonder if there is some way of calculating pi faster on a quantum 
computer.

Hmm. If Anders says that, then there must be something to it. Being a 
nit-picker: what are the prerequisites for QC? Hyperprecise structures
(molecular manufacturing)? Ultradeep temperatures (nanokelvins and below)?
Weird states of matter (like EBC &c)? Appropriate timing (full moon)?

Well, if we have solved the iPFP, the molecular CAM is basically done.
The circuitry components are already there, all we need it to tailor the
proteins and to debug the autoassembly.

I think the "can't" sounds more plausible. If it was (has been) possible, 
we're living in a mockup. Newway's noncooperation assuming, the Cellticks

Ah.  Then given 64 qb, you could search every 1000 consecutive digits of
pi for hidden messages for the first sixteen billion billion digits of
pi, in (of course) the same time it would take to search any 1000
digits.

> I wonder if there is some way of calculating pi faster on a quantum 
> computer.
Easy as... I can't say it.  But any way, yeah, assuming you have 4GB
quantum-writable memory, and a 32qb processor, you can assign each
branch a byte of memory to write to, and calculate the first 330 billion
digits of pi in very little time.  On the other hand, you only need a
trivial amount of memory, like a few KB of QRAM, to check for secret
messages as much of pi as you have the qubits for.  Assuming that only
one branch of reality indicates success.

That brings me to a question:  What do we need for quantum-writable
memory?  Anything exotic?  And by the way, why do we need (say) 45
qubits to factor a 15-bit number?  Shouldn't 15 qubits be enough to test
every possible divisor of a 15-bit number?

My guess is that it isn't as hard as we think it is, while still rather 
tricky. The current experiments use trickery to get the quanta where we 
want them; in a QC we have to be sure that they stay there even when we 
aren't looking. Most likely hyperprecision isn't needed, quantum dots 
might do quite well.

Well, at least it is anothe TLA. I wonder if QAI could make the old AI 
problems with huge search spaces manageable.

Quantum-writable memory: it should retain its coherence for a long time,
but according to Science, plain atomic nuclei will do quite well for this. 
If we can add quantum error-correction, then we will have indefinite
storage. Maybe something like an array of atoms that are refreshed
regularly. 

Shor's algorithm doesn't test every divisor, it uses a quantum fourier 
transform to find periodicities of x^a mod p. I assume this is why it 
need 45 qubits.

According to what I've read, HAARP would create "lenses" in the
ionosphere, which would concentrate solar flux to a small extent, but
enough to influence small weather patterns, and given that the weather
is a chaotic system a small tweak here and there is all that is needed
to have at least a minimally noticable level of control over the entire
weather system. This has been the subject of papers by people involved
in the HAARP project, from what I've read in the science press.

What it means is that since time stands absolutely still at light speed,
from the perspecive of a photon, it exists in every point in the
universe at the same time, and it only has one temporal quanta "unit" of
existence (if that is the way you perceive the universe to be, as being
a stop action movie) from the time of its creation to the time of its
absorption (which are the same). From this, we can see that it becomes
possible to communicate at faster than light speeds. Using a reference
light source, at point C, individuals at points A and B can communicate
by using devices that only have a 50% chance of receiving a photon at
any given moment. Like the classic cat experiment, by using binary 1s
and 0s to selectively observe and not observe the reference source of
photons, we selectively collapse and fail to collapse the wave function.

The recent demonstration of a quantum sensor (the bipolarized laser
experiment) shows that reading the output of a transmitter on a
reference point without influenceing the "transmission" is possible.

back to your question, the universe does exist, but to a photon, all
points are experienced at the same time, kind of like the Improbablility
Drive the Doug Adams used in his Hitchhiker's Guide non-Trilogy.

If this statement is supported by the general ouvre of memetics

done on the topic of memetics recently that the papers are piling up

So, according to you, Einstein said that things are non-local if the distance 
between two points in space-time is not equal to the distance between two 
points in spacetime. Now I understand why you think Cramer's theory is local,  
but I don't understand why you think Einstein was a genius. 

By the way, I've never heard of any concept in human knowledge that can be 
expressed in ONE and ONLY ONE way.           
         

        >A locally causal temporally bidirectional microcausality would allow         
        >violation of Bell's inequality just fine.          


I quote from "Schrodinger's Kittens" by John Gribbin Page 243:

 "The tests of Bell's inequality explicitly shows that "microscopic" 
  causality is violated, regardless of what interpretation of Quantum  
  Mechanics you favor."

I certainly agree that Cramer's theory violates Bell's inequality, it is 
perfectly consistent with all known experimental evidence because it is 
non-local. In another post I gave you a precise definition of "local", 
if you broaden it to such a ridiculous extant that even a particle "shaking  
hands with the universe" is local then the concept of locality forfeits all  
meaning and forfeits all usefulness.           
        

        >>Me:        
        >>Even if we someday find a better theory than Quantum Mechanics,

Nonsense. Science is about prediction, Bell proved that classical Physics,  
or any other conceivable local theory, would predict a smaller correlation  
between the properties of polarized photons or spinning electrons than  
Quantum Mechanics does. Experimental results show that Quantum Mechanics 
makes a much better prediction. Any theory that claims to be better than
Quantum Mechanics had damn well better make a prediction that is at least  
as good.      

        >Again, it [Cramer's theory] only seems non-local when one assumes         
        >that micro-causality is unidirectional with respect to time.


If Cramer's theory only seems non-local then it is really local, if it is 
local then it has been proven wrong, Cramer's theory has not been proven 
wrong so Cramer's they can not be local.

- From "Quantum Reality" by Nick Herbert, page 227:

"Bell's Theorem is an important tool for reality research because it enables  
 folks who create imaginary worlds confidently to reject millions of  
 impossible worlds at a single glance. Bell's theory tells you right away:  
 If it's local, it's hokum."

- From "The Unconscious Quantum" by Victor J Stenger, page 111:

"What Bell had succeeded in proving was that realistic, local hidden 
 variables cannot provide a deterministic mechanism for Quantum Mechanics, 
 if Quantum Mechanics is to apply to individual measurements."

- From "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz R Pagels, page 165:

"There were only two physical interpretations of Bell's experiment- either 
 the world was nonobjective and did not exist in a definite state, or it was 
 nonlocal with instantaneous action at a distance. Take your pick of 
 weirdness."

I now quote from John Bell's original paper. After deriving his inequality he 
says that if it is experimentally proven to be false, as it was 20 years 
later, quantum mechanics or any successor theory must have certain qualities:

"In a theory in which parameters are added to Quantum Mechanics to determine 
 the results of individual measurements without changing the statistical  
 predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring 
 device can influence the reading of another instrument no matter how remote. 
 Moreover, the signal must propagate instantaneously."

If somebody says Cramer's theory is local they are libeling it, they are 
saying it has been proven to be false, and that in untrue.

Boy, you really have it in for Von Neumann. The poor man made a mistake, even 
the best of us do that from time to time. Everybody knows it was a mistake, 
I don't see how it's blocking anything.

Exactly right!  The concept has been taken out of the political or
social context where it belongs and misused in tendentious metaphysical
arguments where it has no meaning.

Think on this all you metaphysicians out there: would you say an atom
could or couldn't have free will? 

Then how come you see sense in the idea that human beings can be
determined?

(Of course a human being could be determined by constrained by all kinds
of gross pushes and pulls, by all kinds of entities at the level of the
middle sized furniture of the world, including other people. I am
constrained by the walls of a maze, for instance. But that's not enough
for you metaphysicians is it?)

Everyone folowing  this thread should check out "Elbow Room" by Dennett,

I don't know if it's the same play, but those of you in the UK can see
Breaking the Code, on BBC1 on Wednesday, 5th February. Apparently 'times
vary' but here in Lancashire it's on at 10.30pm. It's about Alan Turing, and
stars Derek Jacobi in a performance which Chris Riley of the Telegraph
describes as 'mesmerising and very moving'. (Those rationalists amongst you
may choose to find it merely jolly good.)

(As an aside, in searching for the times of the above I came across a
program this Tuesday on BBC2 about game theory: The Numbers Game, at 7.10pm)

You're not going to find authoritative sources on this because it's not much
of a problem.  CR before adulthood will stunt growth, but once brain growth
is done in early childhood it won't cause significant health problems.
 Losing too fast can cause trouble (e.g. anorexics), particularly heart
trouble; in mouse models you need about 6 months to lose the weight safely.
 Whether this translates to humans needing 6 months or 5 years is an open
question.  Few, however, can maintain a level of CR intense enough to lose
that much weight (30-40% below a normal lean weight) in any circumstances.

That one's off the deep end.  The question is more whether it needs to be
started before puberty for maximum effect.  Some research has indicated a
loss of effectiveness with late onset of CR.

A system that relies on captive consumers who can't notice or question =

uses graded (i.e. intrinsic) values for feed-forward unsupervised =

The result of using analog or hidden variables in systems is that they =
cannot be examined, backed-up and eventually can't be trusted.

The good news is that it is easy to prune any analog 'beanstalk-like' =

I wasn't being harsh.  There's a lot of good recommendations (extra of most
vitamins, keep fat and calories down, plenty of trace minerals, etc.)  But
the the original poster requested superlatives ("best", "optimal" "most
efficient") and that is most definitely not to be had.  All this stuff is
most tentative.  Remember the results of the long-term beta carotene studies?

The best way to succeed in CR is a *completely* open question.  I'm not aware
of one whit of research in how different methods compare in effectiveness.
 Animal models are useless as the animals can't make informed decisions; they
must be forced to eat less.

No, you can't communicate using such a device!  This is the original
EPR paradox, and as has been discussed here recently, Bell's work does
imply that something strange is going on here.  But there are no results
that I am aware of in standard QM which would allow communication via
the faster-than-light connections which are often invoked to explain
the results.

I need to learn more about how quantum computers would work, but I don't
think it is quite this easy.

I understand that there have been some algorithms proposed which speed
up search operations on a quantum computer.  The main reference which
I have seen mentioned is Grover, "A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for
database search", Proceedings of STOC96.  I haven't read this paper,
but I've seen it summarized as follows:

You want to search a database of N items for one of S items which
satisfies some criterion.  Normal search would require about N/S checks.
(For example, there are 100 items, and 4 of them are good; you'll
have to check about 25 items before finding a good one.)  Grover's
quantum algorithm does it with the square root of this many checks.
(Your computer would only have to check about 5 items using quantum
parallelism in this example.)

This is a considerable speedup but is not fully parallelized in
the naive sense.  We might think of a quantum computer as one which
simultaneously checks every possibility.  In that latter case it should
take just one fully-parallel check.  We don't get that, but we do get
a speedup.

It's not clear a priori that the problem of searching for patterns in that
huge chunk of pi matches Grover's formulation, but even if it does then
it would take 2^32 checks (compared to 2^64 on a conventional computer)
or four billion times longer than is stated above.  That's still a lot
faster than doing it without quantum parallelism, of course, but it's
not as dramatic as what was described.

Also, I think you will need a lot more than a single 64 qubit register
to execute the calculation.  This register, as I understand the proposal,
is an index which specifies which block of 1000 digits in pi's expansion
to test.  But the test itself is undoubtedly a complicated mathematical
program.  I would expect that considerably more storage space will be
needed to represent all the intermediate values needed for the algorithm.

So, while quantum computers will be remarkable things if they can be
built, we should try to keep a sense of realism in terms of what they
will be able to do.  They don't give us full access to the Everett
multiplex.  Tricky algorithms can give us some speedups, but there are
many limitations at present.

Eugene concludes:

Conceivably, yes. One might try to find, for example, a way of
representing "anglophone linguistic hyperspace" so that all
grammatical sentences turn out to reside on a proprietary
hypersurface within that hyperspace, with the logical relations
between them reflected as spatial relations of some kind. I do
not know how to do this, of course, but it holds out the
possibility of a alternative to, or potential reduction of,
the familiar Chomskyan picture.

As for the "set of beliefs" that is commonly supposed to constitute
a person's knowledge, it may be that a geometrical representation
of sentences will allow us to solve the severe problem of "tacit
belief" [...]. Just as a hologram does not "contain" a large
number of distinct three-dimensional images, curiously arranged
so as to present a smoothly changing picture of a real object
as the hologram is viewed from different positions, so may humans
not "contain" a large number of distinct beliefs, curiously arranged
so as collectively to present a coherent account of the world.

Gene, I want to give you my most heartfelt thankyous for putting into =
words my life's work in this area. The means with which I express this =
work is found in the continued development of my Ingrid Thought =
Processor. Ingrid is in the public domain as non-proprietary DOS =
freeware and can be downloaded from my website.

I have been a lifelong nature lover.  At 50,  I have seen the expansion
of urban sprawl around the Philadelphia metropolitan area.  Places that
were relatively wild and were I hunted 30 years ago are now paved over
and developed.  I have also read numerous environmental and ecological
books.  Many of these writers have a view of the future in which humans
live in an ever impoverished biosphere and eventually exceed the
carrying capacity of the earth and cause a major ecological catastrophe.
 Since I have lurked on this Extropian list during the past six months I
have gained a different perspective of new technologies and eventual
migration of humans or posthumans to outter space.  I just wonder if the
dystopian futuristic visions of a sort of Blade Runner type landscape is
what we can realistically expect or will the new technologies change the
present resource consumption patterns that cause forests to be clear cut
and through the extraction of fossil fuels cause Exxon Valdezes ?  Will
biotechnology find new ways to feed humans so we don't have to overfish
the seas causing depletion of fish such as I heard has happened at one
of my favorite resorts in Perce on the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec?  Will
there be a future in which a wide diversity of flora and fauna exists
and also megafauna such as grizzly bears can make a comeback?  Or do
Extropian posthumans value this type of wild nature?  I have mentioned
the works of Daniel Quinn such as ISHMAEL.  The fictional work ISHMAEL
is about an Socratic experience of a human learning about life and the
world  from a gorrila.  The gorilla ISHMAEL is symbolic for the
non-human biological community in the metaphor that since homo sapiens
appeared on the scene God does not care anymore about the rest of
creation.  How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear?  Does the grizzly
bear have a right to exist:  large expanses of wild uninhabited land in
which to roam?      Cyber Ed

So Sorry!! I've just found out that this was happening. It wasn't =

the 'send original as attachment' off. Let me know if it didn't work. - =
ok? I take it, that the original message was sent as an attachment and =

 Yes, indeed. How many high-level mathematicians do you know? Most of them
 are not attractive in the same way as Lyle's friend. Whether that's
 because they're mathematicians or was true beforehand is another question. 
 
 > What an odd thing if you do. What does one thing have to do with another?
 
 Because, as he said, serious mathematical/science study programs you to
 think in certain ways. In most cases this seems to make people more
 introverted and less aware of their physical appearance. It certainly
 tends to cut them off from ecstatic states, which seems to be one major
 aspect of physical attraction.

  >>

I tend to agree with Mark -
IMO it is *rare* to see highly attractive people who have found the willpower
to spend a lot of time at internal work, and maybe it's because it isnt
stressed as important ( really pretty people can Do intellectual stuff, some
of them anyway , with the prerequisite of hard work, but they may not NEED to
perform in other ways to get approval or acceptance- whereas someone ugly may
find LOTS of alone time to fill with study).

This is not a superstitious list, I suspect you knew that ; I agree on the
surface this statement sounds a bit ambiguous.
If you took these words as mystic I did not. Example:  body builder eats and
exercises from her/his mind... his "spirit" is his will, (disciplined or not)
and (s)he finds him/herself as changed... through manifestaion of intent....
Our body is the easiest to automorph, in fact.
Our posture, our facial expressions, vocal tones, movement , grace and poise
all reflect our self esteem, our inner self...
In fact, if we have money, we can freely exchange our features for ones that
suit us better...
It is controlled by our mind...  made concrete by our will....
I agree with Lyle.

This too was stated in the Popular science oct 95 I believe entitled

As mentioned on the >H list a few months ago, Breaking the Code is 
based on a Broadway play about Turing's life, and it focuses on the 
personal aspects of his life--losing his job and being committed due 
to his sexual orientation.

I was really sorry to have missed it tonight, as I've been watching 
for it.

You're right, it was a dirty trick, as was my asking the question in the  
first place. If I had no idea what a definition was, how on earth could I  
know if your definition of "definition" was correct?

Let me also say that although you have certainly not made a non-circular  
definition of "definition", you have made a hell of a lot better stab at it  
than most people.
         

        >and that I also included an explanation of all the cognitive objects         
        >associated with "explanation", "information", "formation", and         
        >"symbol".  
         

You did fine for "information", "formation", and "symbol" but you didn't  
give an explanation of "explanation", and that's all a definition is.  
         

        >This explanation was in turn the information necessary for the         
        >formation of the symbol "definition"
         

This what? I'm not familiar with the second word you used in your sentence 
above. Could you give me an explanation?
         

        >I could also point to the subjective aspect of watching something         
        >being defined, and that would also be sufficient for defining the         
        >symbol "definition".  
         

You are of course correct, that's how we understand most things, but that's  
not a definition. All of us already have a pretty good idea what a definition  
is, even if we can't define it, that's why the question " What is the    
definition of definition" does not sound like gibberish to us and that's 
why a dictionary is not a useless circular book.

We don't have definitions for the most important things in life. I've never 
seen a definition of mind or intelligence or consciousness that I thought 
was any good, and I don't expect to ever see one, at least not one that could 
be written on a piece of paper smaller than the Galaxy. That doesn't mean 
however that the terms are meaningless. Good definitions are always nice to 
have, but in most cases are vastly overrated. People are seldom able to  
produce good definitions, even of familiar concepts, and it's even rarer that 
they need them, unless they're dealing in a few highly specialized fields 
like mathematics. Formal logic is only a small part of our intelligence, 
so most of our knowledge is not in the form of definitions, it's in the 
form "like this" and "not like this". That's just what you'd expect if we 
are more like neural nets than expert systems, few definitions but lots of

Definitions are explanatory not experiential, that's way they're so hard to 
find, however I know what you're driving at and I basically agree.

I've been studying Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, from the notes at
http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html (especially
http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/node9.html). Everything
but one step makes sense to me so far, so I thought I'd share...

Perhaps we're soon going to have decent-sized quantum computers. At that 
point, if they're going to be very useful, we'll need quantum compilers 
to translate ordinary code into a quantum programming language like Q-gol 
(see http://rosebay.matra.com.au/~gregb/q-gol//index.html).

A note for the future: in "Quantum theory of computation and relativistic 
physics" (quant-ph/9701027), Alexander Vlasov (vlasov@physics.harvard.edu) 
writes "... it should be mentioned that in relativistic physics there is 
no sharp division between q-gates and q-states ...  This property of a QFT 
has some analogy with functional style of programming in modern computer 
science. In both cases there is no essential difference between data 
(states) and functions (operators). A function can be used as data for 
some other function."

And just out: the preprint quant-ph/9702001 says in its abstract: "We 
discuss relations between decoherence and computational complexity and 
show that the quantum factorization algorithm must be modified in order 
to be regarded as efficient and realistic."

Shor's Algorithm, take one 

[Based on Samuel Braunstein's tutorial on quantum computation, at
http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html.]

Suppose we want to factor the number N. Here's the complete procedure
that Shor follows:

A: Find a number x, coprime to N.
B: Find the least number r such that x^r - 1 is a multiple of N.
   If r is odd, return to A and pick a new x; otherwise proceed to C.
C: Since r is even, we can say
   x^r-1 = (x^[r/2]-1) (x^[r/2]+1) = kN (for some k)
   For each of the two lefthand factors, find its greatest common divisor
   with N (for example, via Euclid's algorithm). If this isn't 1 or N,
   you've found a factor.

The first part of (B) is the computationally intensive part. The quantum
computer finds r, in effect, by starting with the sequence (1,2,3,...,q),
where q is some large number, then computing the sequence (x^0 mod N, 
x^1 mod N,... x^q mod N), and determining the period of this second sequence
(which will be equal to r, since by hypothesis x^r mod N = 1 = x^0 mod N).

Shor's algorithm requires a quantum computer with two multi-qbit registers. 
The first register is the read-out point, the second register is for an 
intermediate computation. The qbits are all two-state quantum systems,
so the computer has a set of binary states of the form |0110...;1110...>,
or |i;j> for short, where i is the value of the first register (i.e., the
first set of qbits), j the value of the second register. 

Since it's a quantum computer, we can have superpositions of these states, 
so a general state of the computer has the form

sum[i,j] c[i,j] |i;j>,

where c[i,j] is the complex coefficient of basis state |i;j>.

This is the quantum algorithm for carrying out (B):

Step 1: Initialize the quantum computer to |0;0>.

Step 2: Place the first register into a superposition of all values.
	|0;0>           -> sum[m] |m;0>

Step 3: Compute f(m) = x^m mod N in the second register.
	sum[m] |m;0>    -> sum[m] |m;f(m)>

Step 4: Perform a quantum fourier transform on the first register.
	sum[m] |m;f(m)> -> sum[m,n] exp[2i(pi).mn/q] |n;f(m)>

(q is the number of basis states for the first register; m and n
are summed only from 0 to q-1.)

You can do everything up to this point on a classical computer with

	Initialize c[0..q-1,0..q'-1]
	For all m,n
	  Let c[m,n] = 0
	For m,n from 0 to q-1
	  Add exp[2i(pi).mn/q] to c[m,f(n)]

The quantum transformations corresponding to steps 1-4 have all been
described (just not performed, outside of simulation).

Step 5: "Read out" (measure, collapse) the first register.

... And this is where I have a lapse of understanding. The whole 
point is that the quantities in Step 4 are supposed to add up to
something other than zero ("interfere constructively") only for
values of m which will allow you to infer r, the period of f(m).
So far I haven't been able to demonstrate this to my own
satisfaction, and Braunstein passes the point by in a single
sentence. I'll keep trying.

Since I adequately defined "symbol formation", what's left to define
about "explanation"?

Given "information", "formation", and "symbol":
Explaining:  Presenting the information used in the formation of a
symbol.
Definition:  The information contained by a symbol.

Non-circular, unless you'd care to challenge "presenting", "used", or
"contained"?  Maybe "presenting", but I can define that as the encoding
of the information as linguistic speech, the pronunciation of that
speech, and the decoding of that speech by the recipient.  Trivial.

Welcome to the exciting world of analog computing. Thanks to the new Heath 
Kit Home Study Course, you can build your very own analog computer in the  
privacy of your own home. Make big bucks! Amaze your friends! Be a hit at  
parties! This is a true analog computer folks, no wimpey pseudo analog stuff 
here, this baby can handle infinity.

Before we begin construction there are a few helpful hints I'd like to pass 
along. Always keep your workplace neat and clean.  Make sure your computer is 
cold, as it will not operate at any finite temperature above absolute zero. 
Use only analog substances and processes, never use digital things like  
matter, energy, momentum, spin, or electrical charge when you build your 
analog computer. 

Now that we got those minor points out of the way we can start to build 
your analog computer. 

Step One: Repeal the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. 
Step Two: Use any infinitely accurate measuring stick you have handy and ...

As long as macroscopic events are the result of atomic motions, 
it doesn't matter whether atomic motions are deterministic or not.  
(a) Suppose they are:  each atom follows a path prescribed for it by a 
differential equation, and the result of all such motions is the world 
we experience.  
(b) Suppose they are not:  atoms (sometimes) move discontinuously 
and unpredictably, and the result of all such motions is the world 
we experience.  
It amounts to the same thing either way.  Our lives are the result of 
atomic motions of some kind, whether those motions are continuous 
or not.  

In other words, introducing randomness doesn't really change the 
situation.  Atoms still do whatever they do, independently of us.  
They lead, we follow.  The only way to avoid this conclusion is 
to go to the root of the problem, and get rid of the assumption that 
the macroscopic world is the "result" of atomic motions.  

Atomic events are not separate from or prior to large-scale events.     

When I do something, the whole ensemble of atoms which constitute 
my body (and other atoms in the air, etc) move accordingly.  Their 
movements are not separate from my action;  their movements are 
the embodiment of my action.  They don't lead me;  I lead them.  
Causality operates from the top down, not from the bottom up.  
This does not contradict the fact that each atom follows a path 
prescribed by the laws of physics.  The atoms do what they have to do, 
given the forces acting on them.  It's just that the forces which act 
on the atoms are part of a large-scale pattern.  

This also applies to animals, and even to machines.  Your car doesn't 
travel down the road because all of its atoms happen to be moving in 
that direction!  It's the other way around:  the car moves, and the atoms 
move with it.  

Once you get that straightened out, the "problem" disappears.

I have not the slightest idea because your sentence makes no sense to me,

Since I adequately nerdsnaped "symbol formation", what's left to nerdsnap

Yeah, so you asked a circular question.  So what?  How is that my
fault?  I still gave you a non-circular answer.  Besides, now that I
understand that you're objecting to your own question rather than my
answer, it's still easy enough to get out of.  First, I use the
subjective definition I scorned earlier so you understand what nerdsnap
and diphelzeation are, and then I give you the cognitive definition. 
Still easy as pie.  So what new alteration will you make to the rules
now, to prevent me from winning?

The subjective referent of "explanation" is easy enough to establish:  I
ask you a few "why" questions, and then say:  "See?  You just explained
something."  If you think this is circular because of "why", I can
exercise my subjunctive omnipotence and videotape your own brain as it
goes about its course, and flash a red light whenever I detect you
explaining something to yourself.  Then a red light symbolizes
"explanation".

This does presume that you start out by explaining things to yourself,
but any human *will* do that.  And if you DON'T start out by explaining
things to yourself, I'll take a <bleep>ing AI that I programmed with my
own <bleep>ing bare hands and print out the <bleep>ing assembly and
define "definition" right down to the basic <bleep>ing constituents of
computational causality!

And finally, if you ask for a non-circular definition of "definition",
and I give you back an explanation with the note "this is a definition
of 'definition'", and then you refuse to know that I am answering your
question, so that my non-"explanation"-mentioning cognitive explanation
doesn't even get processed, you can take your <bleep>ing <bleep> and
<bleep> it up your nose.  Of course defining "definition" requires you
to enact the cognitive events associated with definition!  That doesn't
make it circular.  Circular reference requires that the explanation
refer to itself, not that the process of comprehending the explanation
refer to the explanation!

Our "visual cortex" is areas 17, 18 and 19 of the brain.  Even though
you took that in through your visual cortex, "visual cortex" is NOT a
circular definition!  "Computer screen" is NOT a circular definition! 
"Quark" is NOT a circular definition!  And "sticky note" is NOT a
circular definition, EVEN IF we have to refer to some actual sticky
notes in order to define it!

You are torturing the rules of the game!  Defining definition requires
that we *use* our cognitive facilities for definition, not that we
*refer* to a previously constructed symbol *representing* our cognitive
facilities for definition.  It isn't circular!  Give it up!  Definition
is part of objective reality just like everything else, and can be
reduced to its causal constituents like all good computational
phenomena.

That's not at all obvious. You forget to take a lot of things into acount:
Better tools, new inventions, effectivisation because of technological
progress...

You are conforming into traditional economic reasoning. Try studying a bit
more about positive sum economy.

In my personal ethical system, I regard complex, diverse systems as a
fundamental good (this is a completely arbitrary basis, but it works quite
well). This of course implies that a biosphere is something *very*
valuable, and that keeping it viable and diverse is an ethical act. It
also implies that ideally, I should not interfere in it to decrease its
(long run) diversity, and that to achieve this I should also try to
convince others about the same thing (see the meme? :-). 

Not all extropians or other transhumanists share this ethics (in fact, we
seem to have a free market for ethics :-), but I think most agree more or
less with the basic premise that *extropic* systems are valuable. So in 
the long run we are very radical environmentalists, since we want to 
extend the biosphere to encompass the entire universe, not just a single 
planet.

On the other hand, how protection and extension of the biosphere should 
be implemented in practice, that is another matter; there are several 
approaches ranging from fiat by nanotechnological superiority to free 
markets, and the debate between them tends to run hot.

BTW, the widespread belief that we are nearing an ecological catastrophy
might in some sense be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many people seem to
become passivated by this idea, thinking that it is inevitable and hence
not doing anything practical about it. And the people who become activated
by it unfortunately tends to demand harsh solutions with little regard for
other opinions (after all, they are saving the world). Just goes to show
that we need to develop the human mind a bit further...

How about interfering to increase its diversity?  Should we seek out
forests which are dominated by one kind of tree, and strive to introduce
competitors?  Irrigate the desert?

This seems different from traditional environmentalism.  Environmentalists
would usually seek to preserve even rather stark ecosystems.

Perhaps technology will soon vastly outdo nature in generation of
diversity, comparable to the degree by which rockets outpace cougars.
Our nanites and computers will create ecosystems far exceeding the
complexity and diversity nature has been able to clumsily stumble upon in
its few billion years of undirected evolution.  If so, then demolishing
the rain forests and replacing them with the ultra-exotic designed
ecosystems of the future may be the road to maximal diversity.  I don't
think we'll sign up many traditional environmentalists for this program.

The February 1997 issue of Wired has a nice article on Julian Simon and
his refutations of environmental catastrophism.  I am optimistic that
the continual failures of the apocalyptic predictions will eventually sink
in, and that in the next decade we will see a retreat from environmentalism.

It's even simpler than that: "it's" is two words, "it is".  I find that
people who speak english as a second language use this crutch more
often,
i.e. is it "hers" or "her's"?  (It's probably not 'hers', though. :))

Here's another one: should one close parenteses after a smiley, like in

Hi Folks, 

Of the things going on in the world today, the spread of extopian ideas
is one of the most exciting.  Unfortunately I have some other things
going on in my life which are more demanding of my time, and so I'm
going to have to take my leave from participation in this list.  I
wish you all the best of luck.

I also welcome private communication from anyone who wishes to explore
more deeply the topics which I have discussed on the list.

Lyle, this is a great point.  It is very true that reductionism to
smaller and smaller scales is a completely arbitrary perspective
and that, like you said:  "Atomic events are not separate from or
prior to large-scale events."  Like several other people have 
pointed out, we look at this from the human scale because that is
what is relevant to our lives.  

On the other hand, there is no absolute reason to stop at human-scale
when evaluating our place in the cosmos.  Not only do the atoms in 
our bodies move with us when we move about, but so do the atoms in
our bodies circle the sun at 18 miles/second as the Earth orbits,
and this is just one step out of many going upward to larger and
larger scale events.

Mike, the best thing for you to do now, in your  current dependent position is 
to make yourself appear to have submitted to the will of the hands that feed 
you.  You may have to lose access to the Internet for a while, but that won't 
prevent your mind from growing and coming up with lots of transhuman and 
extropian ideas on your own.  You don't *need* the Internet *right now*.  
There is much you can do on your own to improve your skills and knowledge, 
until you are skillful and knowledgable enough that you can support yourself 
through your own work.

I say, be practical first.  Make sure you will have a place to live and food 
to eat *first*; that is your first priority.  To ensure proper food and 
shelter at this point for you requires a certain sacrifice of your freedom to 
do other things.  You've got to go with the system you're in until you can 
find a way to live in a different system.  The situation you are in right now 
requires certain sacrifices.  You will have to submit to these sacrifices 
until you work yourself into a situation that doesn't require those 
sacrifices.  You need to pretend to be submissive to those you depend on.  
Gain their loving affections, and they will maintain the flow of resources to 
you.  Eventually you will gain your independence if you keep developing your 
knowledge and skills and using your creativity.  If you learn to excell at 
providing people with what they want, it is easier to convince them to give 
you what you want, to make a trade with them.

Just keep improving yourself as much as you can, through whatever means don't 
threaten the security of your life.  Eventually you will be competent enough 
to establish your own independence.

Never mind they are a lot slower than rockets.  If they look more like you,

 I think it already happened with the *pace* of diversity creation.
Memetic innovations (all new texts, programs and speeches generated now
and stored for further selection and replication) seem a lot more
dramatic and numerous than genetic innovations have ever been.

  "Natural" - that is, suggested by economic utility - development of
innovations would probably bring to life lots of complex information
structures and some efficient generic physical media for carrying them.
Those are not fun to lie under though, unlike palm trees.
So somebody would have to redesign the ecologies for just that -
recreational purposes.  And while humans admire diverse surfaces and shapes
of the New Nature, its insides may be filled with adjustable computing
architectures doing something useful, and new materials tested in multiple
automated research experiments.

  Supporting huge territories filled with sparse original life forms?
It may be done if there is enough interest in it.  Not very often,
compared with better ways of using it.   Biological world never left
huge territories of bare stone to preserve the pre-biological environment,
and I can't blame it.

I am still trying to understand Omega's notion of "acausal" actions, which
he seems to distinguish from both randomness and determinism.  An acausal
event is one which has no cause, yet is not (simply) random.  Does this
make sense?  Can we really distinguish acausality from randomness?

It also seems true that, since the brain is composed of atoms and its
activities can be looked at as the activities of its atoms, if the brain
can be acausal then presumably at least some of the activities of its
atoms are acausal.  So this cannot be a concept which applies only to
conscious actors, but it must apply at the microscopic scale as well.

An acausal event is not determined by other events, but it is not random,
either.  What could this mean?  Well, when we think of randomness, we
think of probability.  In principle with a random event we can specify
a probability distribution over its possible outcomes.  Then we can
imagine executing the event multiple times and observing the outcomes
to see what the probabilities are.

This requires a counterfactual perspective.  We have to imagine what might
have happened if we had turned back the clock and redone the random event.
(Alternatively, we could imagine preparing an ensemble of systems in
identical states and observing the probability distribution over the
outcomes of the many systems.)

Perhaps one way to distinguish an acausal event from a merely random one,
then, would be to deny this counterfactual possibility.  We would have to
stipulate that acausal events, by their very nature, cannot be re-done in
the manner that would be needed to establish a probability distribution.
Since in fact we cannot turn back the clock, this is not in itself a
very great leap.

For the case of the ensemble of identical systems, we would have
to specify that this is impossible in the case of acausal systems.
Perhaps there is something about their state which makes it impossible
to (ever) have multiple systems in the same state (obviously I am going
beyond conventional physics here; this is philosophy).  Any acausal
system occupies a given state only once in the history of the universe.
It acts, undetermined by events, and goes on.  There is no possibility
for a statistical evaluation of its random probability distribution
because there is only one event, hence no statistics, hence no probability
distribution and arguably no randomness.

This can provide a counter to the argument that acausality is not a
comforting source of free will because it is "just random", like tosses
of a coin.  Coin tosses and other familiar sources of randomness can
be repeatedly executed and a probability distribution established.
Any given execution involves choosing an outcome blindly based on
the probabilities.  But acausality is different because there are no
probabilities.  The outcome is chosen as part of an irreproducable event.
In effect, acausality is by definition outside of scientific analysis
because there is no possibility of replication and testing.  This is
very different from our conventional notion of randomness and so our
intuitive abhorence of such effects as the source of our actions should
not apply in this case.

Well, that's the best I can do to try to understand what acausality
might be.  It is difficult to find this tiny crack in the conceptual
boundary between determinism and randomness, but I am not sure we can
deny its existence.

What is more diverse, a djungle and a desert, or two djungles? As I see 
it, even if a desert is rather sparse, it contains its own unique 
lifeforms that are much more different from the lifeforms of the djungle 
than any two comparable djungle lifeforms will ever be. I'm sure this can 
be put more stringently, but that is the general idea.

That is true. There are many kinds of environmentalism. Some (perhaps the
loudest) want to preserve nature as it was without any human influence (of
course, then we would have to bring back the wooly mammoths :-), beliving
this state to be optimal in some sense (and hence implying that humans
have a negative moral value; not healthy). A more reasonable approach is
the "harmony with nature" idea, which can range from the extreme to the
downright tame. Then there is what I would call the "playing together with
nature" school which I regard myself in: humans play an active role in
nature, let's make the best of it. I'm sure there are many who dislike
this view.

Hardly any. In my opinion, I would still think a world with both 
rainforests and digital diamond coral reefs would be richer than just a 
world covered with the reefs.

I also think it is quite possible we will reach this state. In my studies 
of jupiter brains one thing is sure: there is room for *tremendous* 
diversity in powerful computing systems. Imagine a Dyson sphere 
containing nanocomputers, all of them running an interconnected digital 
biosphere at high speed...

Ha! You think people will be that rational? Just remember the number of 
times Jehova's Witnesses predicted the end of the world at the turn of 
the century, and they are still around...

Environmentalism has been retreating lately at least here in Sweden, but
that is mostly due to bad economy. If you have a job, you can afford to
worry about nature, but if it is a choice between unemployment and a tree,
guess what people choose?

That might be due to the fact that we evolved together with the palm 
trees, so we naturally find them convenient and nice. A being evolved in 
a nanotech ecology might find resting in a reflected beam of sunlight 
from a nanocluster equally peaceful.

I have been thinking of something like this, a bio/nano forest city. 
Imagine something like the Evok city of _Return of the Jedi_, but with
modern conveniences; the trees are supported by diamond fibers and contain
plumbing, energy distribution (from solar collectors in their crowns) and
information networks. A kind of combination of primordial and supermodern. 

(Hmm, I feel the urge to start studying architecture and biotech now...)

What Jim Legg DOES understand is that our current system of production and
the WAY in wich it is valued, is rapidly changing.

I doubt if the system he proposes would work, as few people would be
inclined to become more productive, as they would know anyway it wasn't
going to do them any good. Viewed in this way, he may be a neo socialist,
leftist etc. But viewed from the RATIONAL point of view that value in
Money, isn't allways the same as the effective or real value, he offers
some interesting points for discussion.

The Real value of production. 

Occupating oneself with production of goods and services that are not
neseccarily meant to increase ones wealth, are important for society in two
ways.

1) The enrichment of your personal individual development. (note that this
includes, science, memes, and possibly this list :-) ) 

2) The productions that aren't commercially exploitable straight away, but
that carry the seeds for the possibility to become so. (note that this
includes research etc.)

Any system that ingnores these, or has a low tollerance and high barrier
levels for personal, and individual initiative, is doomed to halt progress.
Not seeing the benefits of your production does the same in a socialist
society, but not having money to begin with, to start initiatives is a very
severe limiting factor in a capitalist society.

Being a slave of money, spending all ones effort on gathering resources can
severely limit the individuals personal development,  in other areas than
the area of production he is asking money for, and the chances he has, of
ever commercially exploiting one of the other areas. 

In fact the current system thrives on specialization to a point where it's
influence on the individuals development can become questionable, and
possibly counterproductive to society as a whole.

Jim is very right in observing that what he calls 'a ruling class' are
people who have the benefit of exploring these other areas better, as their
wealth allows them to do so. Whereas they don't really need to (for reason
2 that is!), as they have already found a succesful way to provide for
themselves.

Secondly, Jim has observed correctly that the value of goods and services
is shifting from value expressed in money, to more abstract definitions of
that value. The Internet probably serves as the best example, (freeware,
and making information available for free, but also various copyrights
violations.) Many types of businesses will find they cannot compete with
free services offered on the web anymore, as the quality of the free
services offered is often higher than those of the commercial services. 

Whatever happens, our capitalist system is changing, and to ignore that, is
just as 'tradidional or shortsighted' as calling Jim traditional or
shortsighted.  

Personally i prefer a free market sytem, but i would refrain from   saying
it is the 'perfect' situation, and that problems that exist are not
structural with regards to the system, but incidental. Anyone who does is
ignoring the roots of certain problems in society. Never would i say that
there is no room for improvement, even structural. I think doing so is very
dangerous, as contentment often kills inventiveness...

I thought the cerebellum was involved in fine-scale motor coordination,
not in conceptual recall. Are you sure you aren't meaning to say
"cerebral cortex" instead of cerebellum? That's a guess on my
part...  you've really lost me.

This is an interesting tack to take, but your assertion that
"experiences" or "transformations performed on the current working
memory or visualization" are nonsymbolic is unsupported.  The
distinction you are trying to draw here seems spurious to me. I
suspect that where you are using the Hofstadterian word "symbol"
I prefer the word "concept", but it's not as if we have pinned
these things down in the physical brain yet, so we can use what
words we choose, I suppose.

 >	Classical AIs have no visualizational facilities and their symbols are

 >a horrible model of the mind.

The formation of concepts from the interaction between nonlinguistic
percepts and linguistic percepts is still quite poorly understood.
Your criticism above fails to touch (for instance) Moravec's robots,
since his machines do have visualizational facilities and their
"symbols" (though actually they're probably much closer to naked
percepts than to linguistically informed concepts) are constructed
on the basis of data from these sensorics, and yet don't come
anywhere near human minds yet. They are impressively moving down the
sphexishness axis, though.

I suppose I'm going to have to read Calvin's THE CEREBRAL CODE now, as
it seems to be the latest hot book. (I wish Edelman were a better
writer.) (And after rereading what I've written below, I'm thinking that
I'm long overdue to get around to Bateson.)

 >Definition (n):  An explanation intended to convey all
 >information necessary for the formation of a symbol.

I think the word "symbol" is a bit vague for this context, but I
understand your wanting to follow Hofstadter's jargon. Perhaps a
definition is an explanation intended to convey all *linguistic*
perceptual information necessary for the initial differentiation
of a concept from a preexisting (in the audience's mind) seed
concept...  hence the traditional Aristotelian emphasis on genus
and differentia in definitions. But definitions, being linguistic
constructs, clearly cannot contain the nonlinguistic perceptual
information necessary for the full and accurate differentiation of
the new concept from the seed concept. Because the words used
*within* the linguistic definition are presumably connected to
nonlinguistic perceptual memories associated with their initial
formation and development, a definition of a new word is an attempt
to bootstrap nonlinguistic perceptual information (associated with
the words used to construct the definition) into the newly
differentiating concept.

Clearly, the most effective definition is going be as dependent on
the conceptual resources available for exploitation within the
audience's mind as it is on the actual "content" of the concept
within the speaker's mind being defined.

Let me add my usual caveat that by "mind" I mean the information
process or system instantiated by a human physical nervous system,
and not anything particularly mystical.

No, the formation of a symbol would be something more like learning the
proper and effective use of a concept (symbol, in your terms). Defining
a symbol means to construct an explanatory string of language; forming a
symbol means to construct a set of state-space boundaries and
connections within your brain... a much more extensive undertaking.

Fascinating! So maybe deep down, everything is Lisp after all...

I have found some bad news: while quantum key exchange is unconditionally 
secure, quantum bit comittment, coin-tossing and oblivious transfer are 
not unconditionally secure, they can be cracked using EPR and quantum 
computers:

http://babbage.sissa.it/abs/quant-ph/9605026

I found a whole pile of interesting references at quant-ph/9605, a good 
month. Mitch, you might be interested in Wang's papers about theory of 
general systems; I don't know if they are good, but they looked 
interesting.

If there is no distance between the points in spacetime
(Why is that?)
I do not need to travel through a distance of time(1)

A<-(0)->B

also because there is only one spacial dimension,

A<-(0)->A

which is the point of light.

A

(Ignoring the impossiblity of two faces of one point.)
There are too many mediums between us, too much distortion.
It is possible for light to bounce off you and into my eye,
but for me to rearrange the patterns 
to their original form would be difficult.
If it were to travel though a consistant medium, say fiber-optics,
It would be much easier.

I get the feeling light is not the fastest thing.
Why is it we can see light move from A to B,
but a light being can not?
I believe the fastest thing should appear to be one point,
no matter if it is viewed internally or externally.
(If you must attack me for my independant thinking 
please refrain from insults,
just prove me wrong with a paragraph)

I know the subject of light was probably worn out long ago,
but interactive learning is SO much better for me.
I have become "spoiled".
I used to spend four hours a day at http://www.search.com  .
Now I rarely need to look beyond this list 
or the few transhumanist's bookmarks I have.
I do not like to read a book 
and to disagree with some thing on page one.
I lose some respect for the authors
when I have to read things I believe are wrong.

Some more questions:

Why is a lightwave so fast?

Does it ever slow down?
If it does, is it still light?

Why is a wave called light when we see it, 
sound when we hear it,
heat when we feel it?
It's still just a wave, is it not?

Why do we say: see, hear, smell, taste, feel
when we are really only feel it?

Light creates heat and sound, 
heat creates sound and light, 
sound creates light and heat.

Has any one thought of the grand unification theory yet?

I'm surprised to encounter such negativity towards the physical 
attributes of cognitive individuals on this list!  Why should mental 
ability detract from physical or any other kind of attractiveness?  

Our cultures present us with such limited maps for who is sexually 
attractive, and this can lead some individuals to lesser 
self-confidence in what they have to offer.  By moving towards more 
sophisticated development of our own sexual charisma, and looking for a 
broader set of attributes in others, we break free of these 
limitations.

Jacobi was splendid. I was disappointed at the choppy chronological
discontinuities of the whole, but the individual "flashback-style"
pieces out of which the whole was composed were brilliant. Especially
Jacobi. (It was funny though... his portrayal of Turing's stutter has
now fixed in my mind the ludicrous impression that Turing was a

Thank you, Masterpiece Theatre.)

Why worry about the rest of humanity? The best way to attract people who
are attracted to someone like you is to be someone like you, no? The rest
of humanity in this context would denote people who are attracted to
someone unlike you. Granted, there are more of them, but they aren't so
great to have around, I tend to find, even compared to no one.

Another alternative is for the system to prefer stability in one of
the areas under its control.  It wants to do what you say, and wants
to continue to want this.  This idea is pursued by Minksy in his
Soceity of Mind book.

<< CyberEd:
I just wonder if...Blade Runner type landscape is what we can realistically

Sorry, Ed.  Improved technology doesn't make people smarter ( unless it is
implants ), it just enables them to do stupid - or smart - things with 
greater effect.

The majority of mankind's history has been under economic systems that
encourage stupid wasteful use of resources.  It has only become obvious in 
the past few decades because of technological leverage.

The solution is really quite simple IMHO; rearrange your economic system
so that economic values match ecological values.  Reward people for
doing things that are ecologically desirable.

  A positive example: cows are economically profitable, so some people
  have a strong motivation to raise them.  We thus end up with more
  cattle in this country than in India where they are deified.

  A negative example: some migratory birds ( sorry, I forget the species )
  are on the endangered species list.  If that bird settles on my property,
  then I am prevented by law from altering my land.  Thus the bird has
  become a *negative* economic value.  I then have an economic incentive
  to shoot the bird, bury it, and deny that it ever was there.  People
  do this, and the species becomes even more endangered.  Negative feedback
  doesn't work.

<< How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear? [ ...and his habitat... ] >>

As an oportunity to make a profit... *if* you set up your economy right...
I'll bury you in grizzly bears.  I'll raise so many bears that bear farts
will become a contributor to global warming.

Not surprising, as, like Britain, the country had a long socialist
tradition which has been increasingly dismantled in the last couple of
decades; in fact I think that New Zealand has gone much further as the
British government mostly seem to be hoping that if they starve public
services of money for long enough they'll 'wither away' rather than
actively abolishing them. Many people who benefitted from socialism don't
seem to like this.

Yes, and one can also consider other kinds of large-scale phenomena, 
such as cultures, political movements, and religions.  The real source 
of causality in the human world is found in memes, ideas, emotions, 
archetypes, gods, etc.

Nope, not at all. Viruses of the mind are not memes; they are social
organisms, complete with cultural artifacts, that USE memes to spread. I
think we are in serious agreement.

Joy left the list a few days ago (partly my fault, of course) and now 
Omega is leaving... our two most promising newcomers.  The list is 
suddenly turning from a dessert into a desert.  I have other things to do

Jim, either I'm completely thick or you're off your trolley. :-) 

You are explaining obscurum per obscurius.  What are the 'non-local
variables hidden in price', and why should anyone bother with them; and
what have they got to do with 'intrinsic value'?  Never mind the AI,
stick to economics for the moment, so that I can get some kind of grasp
of what you are talking about.

Also, in what way are consumers 'captive', if they have a choice?

Show me one place in the present economy where infinity is a viable
economic indicator. It is ALL finite, no matter how big it is. no matter
how much of a feedback loop you are in, it is still FINITE. you can't
even get any spreadsheet program anywhere to be able to calculate with
infinity without bolluxing up your program. Just because the sort of
numbers we are foreseeing in the next few decades are HUGE, they are
still closer to zero than they are to infinity.

I thought that scientists had just demonstrated a laser device that
shows an ability to observe a quantum state without influencing the
quanta (i.e. Heisenberg)? Given this, an FTL comm device is possible.

All you are doing here is making a long, hopefully to you,

For a market to lose confidence, it must be ignorant, lack information,
on the data they need to make the decisions that send price signals in
return. A quick collapse is simply a break in the constant flow of price
signals, which can be caused by many things, a loss of confidence being
merely one of them. AFAIAC, it ain't broke, so don't try to fix it. If
it needs fixing, the past few decades have shown that, with
communication, the market can learn how to fix or evolve itself.

Mike's reply...

I concur that with nanotech the economy for material resouces, will
slowly recede in significance, but it will never completely die out.
THis is rather obvious to most here on the list, however you have been
talking in the present tense, so I cannot help it if you are
misunderstood.

The Russian experiment is a fine example of people attemting to ignore
true reality, and paper it over with legislation of their own self
deceptions. The fact that it has failed while the capital based system
that has been evolving for several thousand years is stronger than ever
is evidence that trying to ignore that history of development is simply
self deception, self feigning...

WIth cyber cash, and hyper privacy, unless some body capable of
influencing money markets is able to accurately read price signals, and
analyse the money supply, as well as supplies of material and
information resources (which they are doing rather poorly at right now),
we risk entering the sort of chaos we thought we had left behind pre
FED.

Believe me when I say I've studied them all. I know the ways of
mindfuck. I always look over my shoulder when someone says "there is no
hidden agenda here..." However, I also have a keen sense of the
practical. The faild russian experiment is a prime example of what you
get when you try to turn the existing system on its head too quickly.
Getting from here to there does not take a revolution, because given the
right stimuli, the market will get there all by itself.

I've been fascinated to watch how people handle this one.  I've hardly ever
seen the parenthesis closed.  I suspect it's a bit like (quite sensibly)
absorbing the closing period or full stop when a complete sentence is cited
within inverted commas *inside another sentence*; sometimes the period
vanishes, sometimes it becomes a comma.  

On the the other hand, I keep breaking my teeth when Australian news readers
announce the latest on `industrialations', when they mean `industrial
relations'.  Do Americans do this?  And how do American male news readers
manage to get their timbre way down there like that?  I'm tired of my
squeaky tenor, I want to extrope my voice into something powerfully
befitting a transhuman.  (Phew, I managed to make it relevant to the list at
the last moment...)

Transhumanists in socialist democracies, like you in your system, work
within the system they have. Jim has the same goals most of us have
regarding the autoevolution of humanity, yet his route to accomplish these
is projected on his political system. What he doesn't see or maybe doesn't
accept, is that his system is changing towards yours, and yours a little
towards his. In the time i was in college my ideas were pretty much the
same as his, when i stepped into the REAL world they changed pretty fast.
Humans are practical and rational, and many will adapt to a situation and
proceed to pursue their goals, in a way that will bring result efficiently,
those that don't, won't see much of their goals realized. Like you found
efficient ways to do it in yours, we find efficient ways to do it in ours,
our logic shaped by that of the system we have to work with.

Please note that this not only goes for people in social democracies who
refuse to adapt to change to a more free market system, but for people in
the states as well, who refuse to adapt to new political and social trends.
Times are changing, a little of the old, a little of the other, plus a new
element ? 

Any political systems influence is just what the individual makes of it,
opportunities, inventiveness and resourcefullness, are trades that benefit
individuals in ANY political system, allthough i agree in some more than in
others, they are NOT inherent to capitalism exclusively. Whereas these
individual characteristics mean little in a politically/socially stable
society (!), they tend to flourish in one that is subject to rapid
change... ;-) 

Personally i'd go with any political system that allows the best
possibilities for the realization of transhumanist goals, A system that
works, works. Fact is the American capitalist system works best at this
point in our status of development (for most people that is, but again
that's what a democracy is about isn't it ?), but that doesn't mean we can
sit back and relax, until it doesn't work anymore. More efficient ways can
be found, and it would be pretty foolish not to even CONSIDER things that
worked in any other form of political system, because we worship our own
form like a 'sacred cow' (btw, this also goes for you Jim), or because we
even FEAR one particular other form, of which the signals have been very
obvious to identify on this list recently. Very rational and open minded of
you my fellow transhumans. :(

Socialist influence on society is losing ground everywhere in the world
except in the US, and the increase of it in your country is only logical,
as it no longer needs to set an example against an ennemy powers ideology.
So logical and predictable. The Roman empire fell, the English empire
couldn't hold, and the communists suffered the same fate. I had really
hoped the open mindedness of the scope of time all of you discuss space
exploration and the future in general in, would have reflected a little bit
more on your political/social and historical perspectives. But instead you
all seem to assume a capitalist democracy in its current form (The United
States of Earth ?) ruling the universe for eons to come i guess. 

Has the thousand year empire finally arrived while the rest of the world
was sleeping ? 

Sweet dreams my friends, for as long as they last...

Authoritarian socialism didn't work for Diocletian any better than
it worked for Brezhnev, and the reasons why have nothing to do with
the presence or absence of democratic institutions. I fail to
understand why it is wrong for me to refuse to adapt to policies
that I am quite sure are counterproductive to the vast majority of
human goals, including my own.

Transhumanist goals to one side, I will not "go with" any political
system that legitimizes the use of violence to punish voluntary
and consensual exchanges without first proving a specific negative
externality. I will not "go with" any political system that treats
half the laboring time of its human population as a resource to be
disposed of at the government's whim, which is the current situation
in most of the world. I will not "go with" any political system
that legitimizes the imprisonment of human beings for such harmless
acts as growing and selling cannabis plants. Nor will I seek a
political order in which the government loots the resources of
non-transhumanists in order to finance the pursuit of transhumanist
goals, and I will oppose those who do seek such a political order.

I guess you didn't notice, but it seems to me that many of the
Americans on this list favor quite radical changes in the system
of government here...  only the changes favored are in the opposite
direction from what you are suggesting we "accept".

 >more on your political/social and historical perspectives. But instead you

Many of the people on this list are agorists (propertarian anarchists),
and emphatically *not* democrats. Personally, I think a "United
States of Earth" would be a political disaster, and I will do what
little I can to prevent such a behemoth from forming as long as I
live on this planet.  Constitutionally-limited representative
democracy seems to me to be the least evil form of insolent
aristocracy under which human beings have slaved and sweated their
days on Earth so far, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and
I don't.

Just say no to death and taxes.

Welcome to the List!  I think you may be pleasantly surprised at the extent
to which transhumanists in general and extropians in particular are
sensitized to the scientific, social and aesthetic issues of our relationship
to nature.  As long-time ExList denizens know, this is one of my key
interests in extropianism.

To me these are _very_ important and apt questions for extropians and the
transhumanist community.  They cause us to look at our core values and at the
specific technologies we choose to use to augment our power in -- and over --
nature.  As I've written before, I find Anders' "complexity ethic" to be near
the starting point for a definition of extropian attitudes toward nature.  As
Anders wrote on 97-02-03 07:17:55 EST:

I'm not sure, however, that this is an "arbitrary" value, in the sense that
valuing complex ecosystems may stem inevitably from the same, more
fundamental "goods" we must hold to value human and trans- and post-human
life.  (This gets into my long-range goal of developing an ethical system
based on fundamental valuation of information processing -- knowers and
knowledge -- very much a work in progress and incomplete . . .)

As I have written elsewhere:

"For now, at least, Earth is the only planet of which we are aware that has
spontaneously generated a rich biosphere.  This phenomenon is scarce.  Raw
materials for an industrial society that can be found elsewhere than on/in
this planet, on the other hand, are not.  Earth constitutes a tiny fraction
of the mass of the solar system.  Even with the primitive survey of the solar
system we have already made, we know we can find and exploit elsewhere the
resources that an expanding industrial civilization needs."

"Extropian environmentalism places a high value on the living wilderness
simply because it is rare and options exist and more will exist for the
continued technological development of consciousness other than consuming
those living wilderness zones.  This does not place an unreasonably absolute
value on living wilderness, but simply makes preserving it as much as
possible one value among many, albeit a great value.  Preserving living
terran wilderness zones is consistent with the value of spontaneous order
simply because life on this planet is, so far, the most complex example of
this phenomenon of which we are aware.  If for no other reason, mere
curiosity about spontaneous order should lead us to interact with at least
some of these zones as little as possible, at least until we better
understand the processes that gave rise to them and by which they continue to
operate."

This language is excerpted from my "Extropian Environmentalism" web page,
which can be found at:

         http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exenv.html

Any list members interested in these questions are welcome to visit that site
and -- more important -- to send me materials and links they believe may be
appropriate for inclusion there.

And, as I mentioned here recently, no better exposition of an extropian
approach to environmental issues can be found than Wallace Kaufman's book,
"No Turning Back".  Again, I highly recommend that book for anyone interested
in the ultimate questions of our changing relationship to nature.

Finally, anyone interested in these questions may also be interested in
coming along on the extropians backpacking trip I'm organizing for the July
4th holiday, dubbed "Expedition 97."  While the trip doesn't have a "theme"
by any means, I'm sure these topics will come up around the campfire.  The
Expedition 97 web page can be found at:

        http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html

Included in that site is a list of folks who have already expressed an
interest in going on the trip.

I've never had trouble telling them apart, just from headers and
signatures.  Same here: our "From:" lines are rather different, our
signatures are quite distinct (I think to think I'm flashier in both
regards) and even our attribution lines are different, not to mention by
using '}' as a delimiter.  I've criticized your notions of Powers and
the Singularity, along with arguing over lunar warfare and defending
English orthography.

Guru George asks:

Jim, either I'm completely thick or you're off your trolley. :-)=20

You are explaining obscurum per obscurius.  What are the 'non-local
variables hidden in price', and why should anyone bother with them; and

Hidden variables are structural. For example, a corporatist hidden =
structure, say in television news broadcasting, prevents any employee =
from speaking out against corruption and lack of real constructivist =
analysis of events by simply replacing the employee (at whatever level).


what have they got to do with 'intrinsic value'?  Never mind the AI,
stick to economics for the moment, so that I can get some kind of grasp
of what you are talking about.

Future planning HAS to take into account AI and the very simple fact =
that AI isn't going to be making decisions based on hidden structures. =
Constructionist AI will look under every rock for every variable. The =
sooner it is realized that AI controllers won't be wanting to place bets =
based on price, the better.

Also, in what way are consumers 'captive', if they have a choice?

On my website I put up "Counter Capitalism" a revealing juxtaposed =
analysis comparing capitalism (corporatism, merchantilism or what have =
you) to Bob Penny's critique of mind-control Scientology-like cults. =
>From which I quote:-

THINGS THAT CAN BE SAID TO WORK BY GETTING PEOPLE TO AGREE THAT THEY DID

As Penny shows, capitalism creates a specialized environment within =
which anything can be made to seem true or reasonable or moral. It is =
this insane environment, not any flaw in the individual person, which =
accounts for the apparently insane behavior which he and many others =
have described, just as similarly perverted environments trap otherwise =
good people in lynchings, gang behavior, nazism, and other social ills.

How does it work? The mechanisms of society entrapment are not hard to =
understand, once you look at them. But there are many things in our =
environment we take for granted and do not look at, any more than we =
look at the air we breathe.

There is no one answer. One is not hypnotized or brainwashed suddenly =
one day and a slave thereafter. It is a process of learning, like any =
other except with demented content. It occurs gradually over time.


Manipulation of national agreements is the key. A manipulated =
environment is created in which, to be loyal to the next generation, one =
must believe the most amazing things and perform actions which, in other =
times, would be beneath contempt.

Societies (not just state capitalism) create a milieu which gradually =
and covertly seduces good people into agreeing among themselves on =
self-deceptions, so they come to believe themselves an elite in unique =
possession of the only right answers. The real result is dependence on =
the country and vulnerability to its control and exploitation.

A kind of insanity is visible in the peculiar group-think ways of =
evaluating or not evaluating information (like Jesus said so) that we =
accepted and sold to each other. If there was demonstrable result, why =
would all the hype and controlled information be needed?

The hype is needed, of course, to allow us to share belief in a result. =
The process can be summarized in four steps -- small steps at first, but =
larger and larger each time around until one gradually assimilates the =
group-think.

1. Sell him something. One is told that if you do X you will get richer. =
It is standard practice to promise anything (without actually promising =
anything), and whatever one can be made to admit to wanting (called his =
self-interest) becomes the excuse for getting him into this process.

2. Whip up gung-ho. Citizens manifest their friendliness, concern and =
hope for one. They make very clear that they want him to get richer and =
they are very sure that participation in capitalism will do it. The =
expectations are set in place so that not to get richer would be a =
betrayal of one's friends.

3. One does X. While engaged in the action, he has special status. He is =
adulated for being on target and carefully not disturbed or enturbulated =
he is clearly an important person. He may also be told how much richer =
he is looking, and how apparent the change is. An expectation of result =
is built for the particular case at hand.

4. One agrees that he is richer. As a good citizen, he will find some =
way to creatively play his part, to justify the time and energy he has =
spent, avoid embarrassment, and not let his children down.

At that high moment, one quickly attests in writing that he got an =
appropriate result from the service and is satisfied. He must do this to =
complete the service, or he is handled further at his own expense until =
he does. No gun is held to one's head so the success story may be said =
to be freely given. The cost of remedial debt provides additional motive =
for everything to be all right.

After I say that everything is all right, my agreement is taken as proof =
that what you are doing is OK. Your success provides the same rationale =
for me. By uncritical acceptance of influenced, unreliable data, we =
deceive ourselves and keep the circle closed. If everything was not all =
right, one's status in the country would be jeopardized. An enemy of the =
country, or subversive person, is said not to have financial gain. =
Success stories, annual reports, and gung-ho agreement are evidence that =
one has "financial gain" and so is a valid citizen.

Never mind that truly needed solutions may be foregone in favor of the =
immediate fix. Principles may be abandoned or redefined as the true cost =
of participation becomes manifest. In this pressure-cooker of agreement =
and gung-ho, the benefit may be illusory but one can no longer tell the =
difference.

As a society member continues to deny his dependence, or to rationalize =
it as moral and beneficial, the poor, the old, the sick, parents and =
concerned others must protect themselves as best they can. An obvious =
concern is the situation of children living in such an environment, =
whose welfare is subject to the parent's need to believe and to belong.

The user-pays bureaucrat's job is to get the consumer to cooperate with =
him in maintaining whatever image he is trying to present while the =
bureaucrat works to destroy the integrity of any independent =
(non-checkwriting) identity presented by the consumer. Perhaps this =
imbalance is possible because the consumer denies (tries not to =
acknowledge) his humiliation. By naming the advertiser's games (in which =
he has participated) the consumer would further discredit himself (by =
association). This would further destabilize the interaction, which is =
normally a cooperative endeavor, in which he has a role and stake.

Under such pressure, the consumer (in a defensive manner, to avoid what =
Goffman calls soiled identity) makes an extraordinary effort to preserve =
the appearance that everything is normal, as best he can under the =
circumstances. A social image which might help identify this denial of =
humiliation is the shiteating grin.

This cooperation is seen in the consumer's creative justifying of =
potentially alarming situations by giving benefit of the doubt or making =
excuses for actions by consumers/capitalists which might otherwise =
appear overzealous or discreditable. Typical excuses include he's =
untrained, he wouldn't do that if he was a Ph.D., these things go in =
cycles and there's a lot of heat on right now, at least he's making =
mistakes on the right side, at least he's doing something, he has =
financial problems, and so on. In such ways, actions which might =
otherwise become clues to the real situation are made to look normal and =
no cause to look further. Thus the faith can be kept and the self-images =
which go with it.

Paper money is only one example of the reversal of values of a =
permission system, which is what happens as capitalism's official line =
becomes correctly understood in actual national practice.

Being able to live with such contradictions is the hallmark of a =
capitalist. The trick has to do with unmocking or making nothing of =
other values, so the contradiction ceases to have meaning. Only devotion =
to the country remains.

So I asked a circular question.

Don't get mad Eliezer, you're among friends.

Yes, you answered it as well as anybody can.

That's exactly what each of us does a thousand times a day, but the point is, 
except perhaps in pure mathematics, the information in a definition alone is  
not enough for me to know what the hell you're talking about.

Definitions work because there is a large amount of implicit information that 
you and I have in common, even if we have never met and even if we don't 
speak the same language. We're both a member of the same species and our 
brains work more or less the same way, and we both share the same physical 
environment that obeys the same laws of Physics. If you point to a tomato and 
a strawberry and some blood and a stop light and say "red" I can figure out 
what you mean, even though I can't define "red", all I can do is say  
something is "like other things we call red" or " not like other things that  
we call red". Fortunately that's enough.

What I'm trying to say is that without this common implicit knowledge things
would be completely didacto, even if they were onrobonob, after all, it has 
been fistwined many times that even the most klognee kinkowine is still 
diphelastory, of that at least I'm sure we can agree.  
              

        >Still easy as pie. 
              

As easy as calculating the exact value of Pi.
              

        >The subjective referent of "explanation" is easy enough to         
        >establish:  I ask you a few "why" questions, and then say: "See?          
        >You just explained something."   
             

Yeah, and your questions will have words in them like, explain, construe, 
interpret, spell-out, account for, clarify, expound, enunciate, describe, 
portray, render, exemplify, restate, circumscribe, limit, and paraphrase. 
All are very closely related to "definition" if they are not downright 
synonyms.

              
        >if you ask for a non-circular definition of "definition", and I give         
        >you back an explanation 


You give me back a what??


        >with the note "this is a definition of 'definition'", and then you         
        >refuse to know that I am answering your question                 


I am hopelessly confused. I don't even know what a refungelation is, and  
you're talking about a refungelation of refungelation.        


        >Defining definition requires that we *use* our cognitive facilities         
        >for definition  
          

Refungelating refungelation requires that we *use* our cognitive facilities 
for refungelation.
          

        >So what new alteration will you make to the rules now, to prevent me         
        >from winning?
          

Nothing, you win. Your trophy is in the mail, just scratch out the 
inscription on it that says "Third place, South West North Dakota Bowling 
League 1959.

Welcome to one of the big surprises of cognitive science.  We know the
hippocampus is involved in LTM (long-term memory) formation, because
people who lose the hippocampus can't form new memories - although, in
retrospect, they can retrieve the old LTM just fine.

So, with those newfangled PET scanners and other close-to-real-time
neuroimaging tools, they finally get a chance to see what happens when
people *retrieve* LTM.  Guess what lights up?

Not the hippocampus.
Not the cerebral cortex.
The cerebellum.

And if anybody can even *begin* to explain this, I haven't heard about
it.  My own guess is that the cerebellum does constraint propagation or
some other kind of constraint-to-visualization assembly, and that is
what motor skills, LTM retrieval, and (another guess) spatiotemporal
visualization have in common.

At the Alcor Festival I heard the quip: "Cryonics is a religion for
atheists."
However, there are really frozen bodies in those dewars, and there is
the possibility
of reanimation. Note I said possibility. This is ahead of religion for
me.

Look, I'm just trying to establish a distinction between form and
content here.  Everything you objected to is simply packaging for your
convenience and the convenience of our hapless readers.  If I take away
the packaging, which is all that you're objecting to, what's left still
makes perfect non-circular sense.

And, in another note, I'd like to point out that your defense has now
completely wandered away from its earlier position that my definition of
"definition" - as opposed to "my definition of "definition"" - is
circular, and is now reduced to claiming that all definitions must rely
on pre-existing ideas.  Again, how is my definition of "definition"
circular, as opposed to our discussion of it?  Please do not object to
this paragraph on the grounds that _it_ is circular.  I know this
paragraph is circular, but this is not my definition of "definition".

Someone I met who had done it said he rolled down his window and sang
at the top of his lungs whenever he was on the freeway.  I think part
of the trick is to talk from your diaphragm instead of from your
throat or chest.  Proper ki-yis in karate are like this.  If you take
classes in large rooms, you could sit in the back and ask questions
and make sure everybody can hear them.  Creativity in finding other
situations in which it's socially acceptable to bellow (I'd say "yell",
but "bellow" has more of a diaphragm (belly, hm) feel) is left for the
student.

Of course, raw material helps, but I think anyone can affect their
(my concession to changing grammar rules) voice.

I just finished reading about the doomslayer Julian Simon in the

but a reality in areas such as Phoenix Arizona.  Sprawl is paving over

I'm not sure what device you are refering to (I'm not that much of a
quantum person), but there are several mindboggling ways to handle quantum
information that might appear like this (quantum teleportation, for
example). But I seriously doubt it would remove the Uncertainty Principle,
since that Principle is fundamental to QM and we would get some very nasty
paradoxes without it.

Well, I just arrived here from a neuroscience symposium where I heard
Tulving and other Big Names discuss memory, and I'm going to do some
actual *serious* (!) research in this subject, so I simply can't resist
jumping into it:

It didn't light up much on the scans we were shown. But I know why: this
was a symposium on dyslexia, and everyone was interested in semantic
memory. While there is definitely some arguments about excatly what is
involved in LTM (or even if there is any clear distinction between STM and
LTM) the "consensus" seems to be like this: 

Hippocampus and maybe parts of thalamus do the encoding of STM into LTM
for *declarative memory* (i.e. the kind of memory you can tell me about,
like semantic ("Kyzyl is the capital of Tuva"), episodic ("At 13.00
yesterday I was watching a movie") or metamemory ("Yes, I know most of the
periodic system")). Nondeclarative memory is handled by other systems,
procedural memory is most likely the basal ganglia and cerebellum. It
should be noted that the memories seem to be encoded in cortex, especially
inferotemporal cortex (perceptual memory) and the prefrontal cortex. 

I have seen several scans suggesting that when you are encoding a
declarative memory the left prefrontal cortex shines up (not the
hippocampus, which is surprising), while during retrieval the right
prefrontal cortex lit up. There are several other parts of the brain that
light up, including the cerebellum, but they seem to be rather transient
and variable. Most people I have talked with agree that the cerebellum is
involved in a lot of things beside movement control; in fact the lateral
cerebellum seems to be quite involved in verbalization (it lit up in some
scans of people reading or listening). 

Of course, one should be a bit critical of PET and fMRI scans - they just
show that something happens, not what. After all, it could be inhibiting
activity or just the "shadow" of signals sent from (say) hippocampus. But
they are suggestive.

Just check the literature. Things like this tend to produce amazing 
amounts of models...

Interesting. I personally think it does error correction, a bit like a
general system for keeping neural signals on track if some kind of error
can be defined. We should also remember that some of its nuclei are
involved in motivation.

          What do you mean when you say that it works quite well? (Do 
          you use another non-arbitrary value system to evaluate the 
          effects of first one, or how shall we understand this?)
          
          BTW, David Pearce has worked out a theory of why you are so 
          fond of complexity. The basic idea is that your dopaminergic 
          pathways are hyperactive, so that you almost never 
          experience suffering. The closest you come to suffering is 
          occasional *boredom*, which therefore, Pearce reasons, 
          naturally becomes your notion of evil. But boredom is 
          generally caused by repetition and monotony; hence 
          complexity, its opposite, come to be seen by you as the 
          supreme good. :-)

          Right. This was what I meant when I say that the 
          pleasure/pain principle could play a part of its motivation

          misleading of me to carchterize this as an *external* value, 
          though. It rather belongs to category 1b on the following 
          list, and should be called "internal":
          
          1a Internal states. E.g. Pleasure; believing a theorem
          
          1b Internal sequences. E. g. Pleasure stemming from a 
          virtuous act; Believing a certain mathematical theorem, the 
          belief having emerged as a result of a process that involves 
          ascertaining the validity of the theorem.
          
          2a External states. E.g. Complexity in the world.

Socialism did work for Russia in the first half of the century, (even
authoritarian) but don't force me into defending a system i don't believe
in. I'm just saying many polictical systems have elements that are
productive and elements that are counterproductive. And that  denying that
is irrational. 

Counterproductive policies are present in most political systems. Having a
(minimal) state/ or having policies *should* allow a society  control over
natural forces that become counterproductive, needless to say it's often
the state that institutionalises counterproduvtive policies. Saying there's
more counterproductive policies in socialist thought than in capitalist
thougth i agree to wholeheartedly. Saying theres no counterproductivity in
capitalist systems is denying facts, saying there will be none in any other
proposed system is utopy.  
'laissez faire' ideals are very high on my list of priorities, but assuring
they keep working somehow is a logical goal isn't it ?

ALL political systems legitimize the use of violence to punish voluntary
and consensual exchange to some degree (you've already stated an example
later on in your reply). The problem here is that your 'specific negative
externality' is a very vague concept, and may very well conflict with the
both the 'voluntary' and 'consensual'  parts of your statement.

Problem is that socialist thought is so integrated in our current societies
that it may not be possible to abandon without abandoning democracy. Why
spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, why not focus on ones that are
acchievable instead ?

Well why not ? The Democracy (=majority=consensus) has decided for you that
they are harmfull, just like you decide and agree with the majority other
things are harmfull or 'unwanted behaviour' for other people. That's the
way the system works Eric, do you publicly oppose the democratic system ?
;-) (don't feel you have to answer this one)

Nor do i Eric, i assure you. Like you their are policies of political
systems i would never 'go with', but i don't think you fully realize that a
political system and it's infrastructure forms an individuals sense of
Reality. His rationality, his ethics, his LOGIC are shaped to work within
that system. And personally i don't see why there could have been no
transhumanist movement in even a communist state, or a fascist state,
ofcourse linked with ideals we would all view very sceptically.

What i am saying is that transhumanist goals are very high on my list of
priorities, higher maybe than political systems and their policies, but not
higher than human rights and freedom. Some people on this list just place
their political priorities (personal?) over the long term priotities of
humanity, i guess.

Oh i did notice, i also noticed that libertarians political influence is
very small, and allthough i sincerely hope that will change,  i also hope
transhumanists among them do not lose their sense of reality. I don't
favour socialist thought, but the majority in your country seems to do so
for the moment, even though THEY may not be aware of it being socialist
thought :-).

ANY planning/strategy a RATIONAL organisation has, cannot allow their
personal dislike of certain policies to blind themselves to these. Refusing
to accept that they are there, and will be there for the immediate future
to deal with, will lead to fleeing / hiding oneself in utopy, and will
certainly be counterproductive...

I don't doubt the seriousness of the people on this list and the ideals
they believe in. But fact remains that MOST peoples political choice is,
has always been, and will always remain based on their personal financial
improvement, and are perfectly willing to give up some freedom for that, as
they perfectly logically mistake the organisational power of the state for
financial power. Bread and circusses...

The Eurocracy of Europe is already forming, we now have four governements
to suck us dry instead of three. Yet it's reality, and all indications
point towards a continuation of this process. To deny or ignore it is
silly, to oppose it, a waste of effort. It offers counterproductivity in
ways of more beurocracy, and increase in productivity in ways of free
trade. The monetary union will probably spice up investment levels. Only
time will tell...    

Again, all ideals we value i hope to one day see realized in an efficient
form that works for humanity, but until that day comes (if it ever comes)
we have to operate and function within the system/infrastructure we have.
You in the USA are very lucky to have found a political party that supports
part of your views, but i think you'll find no equivalents of libertarians
in social democracies. (most european countries, and probably New Zealand)

Don't forget that we're just moving out of a situation not unlike that of
Athens and the Delian league. Not that i do, but publicly opposing or even
questioning democracy is illegal in most other western countries. We work
with the system we have, if we are to acchieve something, that is.

Most ethical systems in use overlap to a great extent (almost all suggests
that kindness is a good idea and practically none of them says killing or
stealing are OK); this is IMHO due to memetic and social co-evolution,
possibly with a biological component. Thus most of the ethical systems,
regardless of what divine or philosophical support they claim, tend to
uphold a generally functioning society of humans (if people actually 
behaved 100% according to them it would be even nicer, but most realistic 
ethical systems have a 'graceful breakdown' property: they work 
reasonably well even if not everyone follows them). 

What is surprising is that many "standard ethical precepts" like not 
killing can be deduced from my complexity ethics without adding extra 
assumptions; this suggests for me that it will be at least 
generally compatible with "standard ethics", that it might work in a 
social setting and that it is in some sense minimal, avoiding a lot of 
extraneous assumptions. Of course, making it work in practice is not 
always easy, and there are still some arbitraryness about 'diversity', 
but I think I manage to follow it in general.

Touché! I like this explanation, it seems to fit almost too well. Yes, I 
consider boredom one of the greatest evils in the universe, and that is 
one of the reasons I became a transhumanist in the first place. 

Hmm, I might get the chance to check out my CNS soon; I'll take a look at
the dopaminergic pathways and see if the results support the theory.

consideration of that topic, in "Wisdomism:  A Moral Theory for the Age of
Information" 2 EXTROPY 22 (Winter 1988-89).  Here's a quote:

     First of all, let me note that most of Wisdomism's tenets will
correspond quite nicely to the moral intuitions that most of us already
possess. This was demonstrated above, in the discussion of Wisdomism's rules
of thumb. Wisdomism will never ask us to sacrifice our planet to alien
civilian engineers, for example, because it recognizes the disposition for
egoistim [sic] as a wonderful means of advancing wisdom. Note secondly that
moral intuitions don't always  favor the interests of our bodies and brains,
as is evident in many current moral debates. The environmentalist movement,
for example, has been initated by people who feel a deep empathy for vastly
complex, efficient and information rich ecosystems. It shows particular
concern for the wisest of non-human animals: dolphins and whales. We might
say that environmentalists value the wisdom of Nature, a wisdom they feel
they share. Animal rights activists and vegetarians likewise object to what
they see as the needless destruction of their kin. All of these parties feel
moral obligations to consider the interests of other information processing
systems with which they share certain traits. It should not prove too
suprising if Wisdomism asks us to do the same.

Id. at 28.

I'm not sure that I would say the same thing today; I would at a minimum
rephrase it.  I'm thus revising the article for republication.  Keep an eye
on the T0Mpage.

Your claims are that things must be getting worse overall because they are
getting worse in one particular place.  That's the non sequitur, not Simon's
claims.

Yes, it's getting worse in some areas.  But it's getting better in others (LA
air has improved tremendously in the 10 years I've been here.  Smog is now
exceptional where I live in Orange County).  Overall, it's getting better.

Yes, but new cropland is being irrigated/terraced to replace it.

>Third World food problems are a reality, take a trip to India.  

Very much so, but less of a reality than at any time in the past.

>Forests are vanishing and being replaced by monoculture tree farms.  

In the first world, both wild forest and tree farms are increasing.
 Deforestation is still a problem in the third world (but see below)

>Fish are being

Deep sea fishing has become a classic 'tragedy of the commons" situation.
 Our fish will come from farms in the near future, just as our vegetables do.
 There will be plenty of fish.

He's not the one saying it.  It's just that nobody can find many species
going extinct.

One thing you have to remember.  Simon does not claim that the non-human
biosphere will do well.  His claim is that our increasing population will
leave us a world where virtually all humans are well-fed, well-housed,
comfortable, entertained, and long-lived.  Humans will be able to preserve
natural habitat if they want to, but whether we have mountain lion habitat,
ski resorts, or some of both will be our choice.

It's hard to believe, but when you read Simon's books he really does
present his case convincingly.  I am now much less gung-ho about
environmental issues than I was before I read his stuff.

Of course you are going to find places where things are bad.  The
important question is, what is the *overall* situation? After all, if
you're going to be spending billions of dollars on supposedly preventative
measures, you ought to get your facts right.  

And when you check out the facts, the overall situation seems to be more
like Simon says it is, rather than as we are led to believe by over-
enthusiastic, over-specialised environmentalists and the media (only bad
news is good news, right?).  Perhaps he does exaggerate a bit, but maybe
that's necessary: if he is to be believed, environmentalists have been
exaggerating a lot, and getting away with it.

I am beginning to think that a sizeable chunk of environmental
propoganda is basically a kind of millenial disasterbation, arising out
of peoples' lack of self-esteem.  Whipping ourselves is supposed to be
cool. I don't think it's cool anymore: in fact I think there's something
a bit nasty about it.

A word of assurance to relative newcomers:  the Extropians list has always
enjoyed a healthy turnover.  They come in curious and leave the wiser.

Why don't they stay and enjoy our company?  Because students *should*
graduate, to go forth into the great wide world.  The scholarly and
companionable hang on a bit longer.

Well put. Lets not forget that it is often the newcomers that really 
start the interesting, unexpected debates or re-opens old fields again 
(if something is discussed again and again it is most likely important 
and in need of continual analysis).

There are exceptions: I love Katherine Hepburn's quote from _The African
Queen_: "Nature, Mr. Alnutt, is what we are put on this Earth to rise
above."  Nature is ruthless, cruel, unforgiving.  I want to do better.

Yes, that was intriguing, but I think unnecessary.  I think self-interest--
which is of course interest in the survival of a specific complex form--
is sufficient to result in valuing biodiversity in general, because the
latter serves us in many ways.  Education, medicine, entertainment, wealth,
and other human values depend heavily upon it.  I, too, think that the
search for an extropian ethic is valuable, indeed the most valuable thing
we can do, because human ethics will affect the future more than any other
single factor (technology does nothing until it is employed by persons with
free will, according to their ethics).

Here's another try at a possible extropian ethical foundation:

(1) Since it is not possible to reach normative conclusions from
  descriptive premises, I must begin by postulating a normative
  value, and seeing what logically follows from that value combined
  with a description of reality.  I describe many assumptions of
  reality below which I firmly believe are reducible to experience,
  but I elide full arguments for each for brevity; I welcome
  challenges to any of them.  I postulate one value: my own
  consciousness, and its continuation.  This is a rational value
  now because immortality is conceivably possible now.

(2) The continuation of my consciousness requires expenditure of
  resources.

(3) Resources are finite.  Ultimately, conservation of mass-energy
  is the only limit, but until technology is sufficient to exploit
  all energy present, resources are limited by our technology.
  Competition for resources is therefore inevitable.

(4) Our own complexity is finite.  It is unlikely that any one
  individual will be able to either discover every means of finding
  resources to use, or of physically using them.  Therefore, non-
  omniscient being must specialize in exploiting those resources to
  which they are best suited.  

(5) Intelligence is the primary survival mechanism of my species--
  our specialty.

(6) Evolution--the mathematical consequence of reproduction, mutation,
  and selection--is inevitable.  At any time /t/ in history, the existing
  complex mechanisms are those that (a) survived from time /t-1/, or (b)
  are created at time /t/, by reproduction by those alive at time /t-1/.
  That selection is inevitable is a consequence of (3).

(7) Other complex forms will evolve to continue themselves and use
  resources at my expense if they can.  To ensure the continuation of
  my consciousness, therefore, it is in my interest to learn as much
  as I can about the nature of such systems, and to create technologies
  that successfully defend against them.  Because of (5), this is the
  course of action most likely to lead to my goal.

(8) The diversity of such systems serves my education and discovery by
  showing me more ways to use resources, and by showing me how my own
  body has evolved, which is necessary for me to understand how to
  preserve my consciousness (my body being its current home).

(9) The maintenance of diversity in the face of scarce resources
  requires that resources be allocated as efficiently as possible,
  subject to the constraint that my own consciousness must be
  preserved.  The system best suited for that (which can be argued
  seperately) is the system of property rights and free trade.

(10) Free trade requires freedom of action, and benevolence.  Any
  act of force reduces the diversity of actions by constraining a
  free actor to the will of the initiator of force, thereby taking
  away the victim's ability to use his owm mind to best advantage.
  Since we have placed one's own consciousness as the supreme value,
  from which the value of diversity was derived, self-defense can
  justify force, but not greed or whim.

Therefore, it is not necessary to postulate the value of "nature"
or "freedom" or "benevolence"; merely postulating immortality as a
goal can lead to those values.

Talking from deep in your diaphragm is indeed the biggest part of it.
This is probably one of the few things I learned from two years of
ROTC that is still sometimes useful to me.  (The marines called it
"command voice" and definitely considered it something to be taught.
It was an important part of marching drill.)

I get my best exercise in speaking loudly ("bellowing" is a good term
for it) at sporting events, either as a spectator or a participant.
You can holler from one end of a softball field to the other and
people are pretty impressed sometimes.  Once you master the technique,
you can help people near you in the stands who are quietly trying to
get the attention of someone in the next section.  I often add my
voice to someone who is off by 20 decibels or so.  They usually
appreciate it.

        In addition, this list is a constant flux.  An unknown amount of
people subscribe and unsubscribe per month.  Hopefully those who have left
have gotten something out of our posts and, as Tom said, leave the wiser.
I think that we, as extropians, should have open minds to the ideals and
pursuits of others.  We all have different personalities and interests, but
the same united goal of unlimited progress and maximized potential.  Often
on the list, some will be enraged by certain posts or posters and in the
same effect, some will be enlightened.  Just as the signal to noise ratio
fluxuates frequently.  Those who are leaving the list are doing just that:
leaving the list...they are not forfeiting their extropianism.  Don't worry
about it [referring to Chris Hind's post here]; cells replenish themselves,
as do we.

I just read about it in scientific american. What it does is polarize a
laser beam, split the beam, and put one of the splits through a
polarizer at 45 deg from the first, plus some other steps I can't
remember, but basically it allows one to observe without influencing.

I would say that anyone with military training learns how to speak
powerfully as a matter of course. I used to speak rather quietly, prior
to serving in the USAF, but now am known as having a loud voice, even
when I speak softly. Its not a concious thing, even when I am paying
attention to my volume, people notice that at a normal volume, I still
can be heard at quite a distance.

Show me proof.=20

In 1969 Dean E. Wooldrigde (the W of TRW fame) wrote a book called =
"Mechanical Man" in which he outlined experiments in which a dog's head =
was severed and reattached to a second dog. He did not say that it was =
kept alive but he speculated that it could be for a long time. As to =
covert studies in this area you have to accept my word, right now, that =
they are being conducted.=20

The difference between a dog and a human is self determination. A human =
who understands and accepts the weak uploading challenge has a greater =
chance of survival than a dog, all things being equal. The political =
challenge for transhumanism is to cancel the covert activities and =
provide legal safeguards for volunteers.

Dear Ed Regis,  I enjoyed reading your article on Julian Simon in the
Feb 1997 edition of WIRED magazine.  I don't agree with Julian Simons
ideas.  I visited his Homepage and have an idea of where he is coming
from as he labels the environmental movement a fraud by con artists.
Julian Simon's perpective is anthropocentric, he really does not care
for anything else in the biological community.  Perhaps this perspective
is also shared by the majority of your readers so when they view the
pictures presented as perceptions and realities on pages 138 and 139
they can feel comfortably reassured that all is well.  Where is the
logic in asserting that nukes are the equivalent of raising the national
highway speed limit 0.006 mph?  The world's oceans are being fished out.
 Rain forests are vanishing and temperate forests are also vanishing and
being replaced by monocultures of tree farms.  Soil erosion is a major
problem.  Air pollution is worse in many areas such as Phoenix, Arizona.
 Valuable farm land is being paved over.  I think Mr. Simon would like
to lull Americans into a comfortable indifference on these issues so
that environmental regulations can be reduced or eliminated.  One not
convinced.  Cyber Ed

I read that article too, and although it was truly a remarkable result it
would not lead to faster than light communication.

What the article describes is a method to determine whether a photon
path is blocked or not, while reducing the photon flux in that path to
an arbitrarily small amount.  It uses quantum interference to determine
whether a photon might have gone down that path, even though no photons
ever actually do go that way.

Theoretically you could scan the photon path across an object and
take a picture of it, without actually hitting it with any photons.
If X-rays could be manipulated optically as easily as visible-light
photons, you could take an X-ray photo of a specimen without exposing
it to damaging X-ray radiation.

I'm not sure what would be needed for faster than light communication, but
this isn't it.

I'm not convinced that extropian ethics can really lead to results
that are at all compatible with modern-day environmentalism.

First there is the issue I raised earlier, that the diversity produced
by nature may pale in comparison to what we will have in a few decades.

I am also unconvinced by the argument that studying nature will shed
light on our competitors and teach us more about our own evolution so
that we can survive better.  The only significant competitors we will
have are other people.  Nobody is going to be threatened by the three
toed sloth.  And improving our own function will probably be best done
by studying our own bodies, and even more by conceiving new and better
augmentations.  We will be able to move so far beyond nature that
information from digging up plants and studying bugs will be of little
relevance to our survival.

Besides that, there is also an externalities/public-goods problem.
The benefit to me of turning the local vacant lot into a revenue-producing
parking lot will probably be much greater than the negligible loss of
diversity that it causes to the ecosystem as a whole.  That lot is a
tiny fraction of the earth's surface and paving it over won't cause
much loss of diversity, while the profit from developing it is a very
tangible monthly income.

Millions of decisions like this by people all over the world will lead
to an outcome where the amount of diversity on other people's lands
is less than I would want to see.  My preference is external and not
reflected in their decision to convert their property to productive use.
Biodiversity in this broad sense is a public good.  If one of us lives
in a world with protected rain forests, we all do.  And individualist
economic systems tend to underproduce public goods.

In a contrarian mood -

Hal

   I used to think I'd never live to see the day when things were really 
   weird enough for me. I no longer fret about not living to see that    
   day. I think that day is coming plenty soon enough. (Bruce Sterling,
   at http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/ui/lcc/sterling.htm)

Somewhere in _Schismatrix_ he says that the principal motor of change
was "the fantastic capacity of the human mind for boredom".

I sometimes wonder if this will be the principal challenge to long-term
immortality. Suppose you have a Theory of Everything, with a secure
epistemological foundation, and the Final Answers to Eliezer's hard
problems (why anything exists, what is consciousness, perfect ethics).
Would you now be doomed to boredom, short of a translobotomy reducing
you to a pre-TOE state of uncertainty?

One possibility is that "having a Theory of Everything" is an open-ended
process, a bit like "having the axioms of set theory". Knowing that, at
bottom, the universe is an aperiodic eleven-dimensional spin network, 
or whatever, might be a starting point for limitless further investigation, 
as well as the endpoint of basic ontological inquiry.

Another possibility is that you will have to invent new things in order
to remain interested. QueeneMUSE wrote, a while back,

Being bored with the phenomena of the pre-SI universe would be another
way for an SI to arrive at a preoccupation with design.

Extropians,  Thanks for your thoughtful responses to my recent postings
about Environmental issues on this list which were my debut in this
learned forum.  Ideologically I consider myself an inquisitive person
who wants to view issues from many different perspectives and so forums
such as this are my natural element.


                  In the past few years, I have been a member of various
environmental forums.  Deep Ecology, Ecopsychology, Abbeyweb,  ISHMAEL
etc. have been the ones that I subscribed to  for various durations.
There was much wisdom and much foolishness to be found in these mailing
lists.  Many environmentally minded people have an unhealthy
technophobia.  An exception is the environmental poet and philosopher
Gary Snyder who has an Internet access and e-mail at the University of
Calif. Davis.  Gary Snyder and other environmentalists are also on the
Global Business Network, seeking answers to tough questions.  It is with
this sort of mentality that I would want to approach environmental
problems.

Julian Simon is a sort of court jester.  If anyone falls for his ideas,
well I got a bridge to sell you.  He is so transparent.  And the
organizations he belongs to lobby to do away with environmental
regulations on industry.  I watched them numerous times on C-SPANN.  One
got their seed money from a certain brewery in Colorado which has not
endeared itself to environmentalists.

Greg Burch, your postings and Extropian environmental homepage are
great.  I am planning on going to Alaska this summer so I won't make
your New Mexico backpacking hike.  I was in New Mexico last summer.

Agreed!  I'm talking about rational respect for biodiversity and the
cleanliness of one's environment.  I see "modern environmentalism"
as a cult of self-loathing luddites with arbitrary values.  I'll
have to think of a word to fight the e-word with, but I don't see
any at the moment.  Perhaps "conservationist" is better, but that
has anti-futurist overtones too.

That may be true.  I'm not ready to count on that just yet.

A species doesn't have to be a competitor or ancestor to teach us about
ourselves.  Surveys of other species are the primary data that support
and refute competing theories of evolution to which we are subject, so
every species plays a part in those theories.  My sexual drives were
formed by the same process as those that formed monogamous gorillas,
promisquous bonobos, polygamous sage grouse, stepchild-murdering lions,
and even social ants and bees.  Without all of them to study, I would
not have had as much data with which to test my theories.  We evolve at
the glacial pace of one generation every 12-20 years or so.  Insects
and bacteria outpace us by orders of magnitude, so studying them is
quite valuable.

I don't think we are anywhere near enough to understanding the workings
of our minds that we can afford to endanger the richest source of data
available for that study.  Perhaps when the first computer wakes up and
argues with me, I'll change that opinion, but you'll have to show me
pretty convincingly.

All you are doing here is making a long, hopefully to you,
incomprehensible to others, rephrasing of what is commonly known as a
price signal!!!

There is as much difference between what a positive-sum 'open quantity' =

is between a balance forward and an open item accounting system. For =
that matter look at the benefits of being on-line and interactive as =
opposed to being in batch mode. Sure the results can be similar but the =
structure is very different. =20

For a market to lose confidence, it must be ignorant, lack information,
on the data they need to make the decisions that send price signals in
return. A quick collapse is simply a break in the constant flow of price
signals, which can be caused by many things, a loss of confidence being
merely one of them. AFAIAC, it ain't broke, so don't try to fix it. If
it needs fixing, the past few decades have shown that, with
communication, the market can learn how to fix or evolve itself.=20

Your obviously not a systems engineer. Remember the joke: If it ain't =
broke it doesn't have enough features yet. For example, your mail reader =
can't wrap-long lines (maybe Netscape 4.0 beta 1) therefore the problem =
must be in my Microsoft Outlook 97 mail sender. Pass the buck - problem =
solved :)

The Russian experiment is a fine example of people attemting to ignore
true reality, and paper it over with legislation of their own self
deceptions. The fact that it has failed while the capital based system
that has been evolving for several thousand years is stronger than ever
is evidence that trying to ignore that history of development is simply
self deception, self feigning...

Are you saying that the Russian example was not the result of =
interference by international bankers and that it evolved without the =
express experimentation of the capitalist Hegelian puppet masters? Do =
you want me to name them?

Really?  So the logical course of action for a Power would be to stomp
on you before you stomped back.  Similarly, the logical course of action
on my part would be to stomp on you before you stomped out my precious
Singularity.  I prefer to think that cooperation between sufficiently
intelligent beings is axiomatic - that is, any two Powers will cooperate
on the Prisoner's Dilemna.  You apparently believe it is axiomatic that
they will both defect.

Putting the ethical issues aside, seeing as how neither of us is a
Power, consider that saying you'll do your best to stamp out all other
sentient entities is not a good idea.  They might stamp first.

Generally speaking, trying to maximize your share of the pie as a
negative-sum game is a bad strategy, because if everyone follows it, the
pie shrinks.  I have no trouble with working to increase individual
shares, as long as the game being played is always positive-sum.  That
is, if you increase your share from 1% to 2%, you need only increase the
size of the pie by 1.1% in doing so.  The best way to ensure this is to
declare that all interactions between players will be positive-sum; this
can be done simply by outlawing the use of coercive force that could
force any individual to make a trade not beneficial to himself.  In
other words, capitalist Libertarianism.

So I reject your philosophy on the grounds that it wouldn't work if
everyone followed it, and in fact won't even work for you because others
will become aware that you intend to use coercive force to steal their
shares, and will launch a preemptive strike.

Anders Sandburg views complex systems as a basic good.
This reminds me deeply of one ethical system I tried on for size, long
ago:  "The basic good is new ideas."

In terms of how this concept actually originated, it's when I tried to
figure out where mental energy came from.  I guessed "new ideas" on the
basis that they would stir up new thought-currents and create mental
energy.  In retrospect, I was completely wrong; new ideas may create
mental energy but simply by originating new goals which are not worn by
repeated viewed-as-futile efforts, or perhaps simply because gaining new
knowledge is a basic goal and even an evolved warning signal for greater
awareness.

In any case, the more I thought about the "new ideas" goal, the more it
seemed appropriate as an actual Meaning-Of-Life candidate - in
retrospect, not an Interim, but an actual Meaning.  Consider that
duplicated information is likely to be no more valuable than a single
copy, and that whatever the Meaning of Life is, it is likely to viewable
on some level as a complex system or informational object.  That is,
you'd imagine the Meaning was *something*, and duplicated *somethings*
would be no better than one *something*.

Unlike Anders Sandburg, I view an entire ecology as being essentially
valueless - because the complexity of an ecology is so much *less* than
the complexity of a single human brain that I'd happily destroy a
biosphere (one not supporting any sentient life, of course!) to save a
human life.  Besides, ecologies aren't conscious, and whatever the
Meaning of Life is, I strongly suspect that it requires consciousness
(or some similar ontologically engineered substance) as substrate.  So
therefore, increasing the number of new ideas held by sentients is the
most likely course to maximizing the Meaning.  This was later replaced
by the Singularity on the grounds that knowing what the Meaning was
would be the way to maximize it, but anyway...

Consider the consequences of this ethical system.  It urges
individualism, critical thinking, the advancement of science and
technology - and keeping up with the forefront, writing and reading
science fiction, the exploration of new frontiers, and above all the
invention of methods of intelligence enhancement.  Very Extropian,
really - especially considering that this system was invented long
before I'd heard of Extropy, although not before reading "Great Mambo
Chicken" and being raised as a Libertarian.

So that's my proposal for a definition of "extropy" as a substance:
New ideas.

How about habitationalism ? Or something involving the word 'habitat' as it
can also mean 'area in which a species is distributed', pretty extropic
compared to a rather static 'environment' eh ?

Habitationism maybe sounds too much like some fascist 'blut und boden' theory.

All definitions, IF that's the only information you had, would be circular. 
A dictionary would just say that one squiggle is equal to another squiggle 
and that squiggle is equal to yet another squiggle in the same book. 
You would not learn one thing about our world or the humans who inhabit it. 
In the real Physical world dictionaries are useful because Lexicographers
know there is a lot of information that all their readers have in common that 
is not in any book. 

If I am frowning and have tears in my eyes and say "I am sad" then you don't 
need any book to have some idea of what I am feeling. If you then read that
"happy is the opposite of sad" then you understand in a deep way what "happy" 
means, it is no longer just a squiggle, it is a symbol with meaning.

"Definition of definition" has a circularity in addition to the one I 
discussed above. If you asked me for the definition of something I know 
about, I may not be able to give an answer that would satisfy a rigorous 
Philosopher, but the man on the street would probably say it was OK. If you 
said "Give me a definition of frizbaum" I'd  say "I can't" I'd know what you 
wanted me to do I'd just be unable to do it.  If I didn't know what a
definition was and you said "Give me a definition of definition" I'd say 
nothing because your vocalization  would be as meaningless as a burp, 
just a noise you made with your mouth.

I don't think there is any meaning to life.  IMO to ask for the meaning of
life is like saying "what is the meaning of this shoelace?". It does'nt
have a meaning, it only has a purpose. I think extropians should not be
concerned with finding the meaning to life. There isn't one. We are here
and that is that. Understanding the mechanisms by which we got to here and
deciding where we are going is tough enough without assuming there is a
*meaning* to it all. I think our duty is, however, to create the noblest
and greatest *purpose* we can, and to follow it!

At this point, I'd either delete content from major areas of my brain or
put myself in an endless loop of ecstasy and wait for the big crunch.

Either that or do what I do. Don't read every damn message on the list! It
drops the signal to noise ratio as well as the amount of content you have
to read. Sure there are filters, but the best filters are the human brain!
Your brain comes automatically equipped with a information priority
labeling system. Just as you automatically hit delete when you see an email
advertizement or when I used to do my mass postings to the list, you can do
the same if you aren't interested in a particular topic. When the subject
delves into deep math, philosophy, or semantics I usually don't read them.
About every month I scroll up the list of headers in my Eudora inbox and
find the middle of the list. I then highlight all headers above the middle
and delete them praying that the list archive hangs onto them for me.
Everyone is capable of doing this.

I used the word "defend".  Why you interpreted that to mean "stomp
on them before they stomp on you" is something you'll have to examine
about your own mind, not mine.  I expect most defense will be against
non-powers, not against other powers.  Since I--a lowly human being--
understand the nature of the prisoner's dilemma and the value of
cooperation, I would assume no less from another power.  But there
will evolve beings without that realization for whom predation is the
method of choice.  Not just non-sentient carnivores, but predators of
the human sort as well.  To deny the possibility of crime and other
irrational behaviors in posthumans is to willfully ignore the facts.

Exactly, which is why I never said such a horrible thing.  I said
quite precisely that my /only/ goal was to preserve my own consciousness.
Not to destroy or impede others.  Indeed, I can't do it without free
trade and innovation and specialization of others. 

The game changes when technology changes.  Until immortality was a
reasonable possibility, my ethic would not have made sense.  After I
and other powers have expanded into the universe so far that further
progress cannot be made but at the expense of others--if that happens--
then the rules will change again.  But we're not there yet.  Since our
ability to exploit resources is miniscule, technology makes trade and

I quite explicitly reached laissez-faire capitalism as a consequence
of my ethic, yet you claim otherwise.  Did you just get bored reading
to the end, or did I not explain that clearly enough?  I believe my
exact words were "property rights, free trade, benevolence, and the
rejection of force".  What part of that was unclear?

As Bookends to the 20th Century, 2 Views of Technology's Promise
By  Ashley Dunn
February 5, 1997
http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/020597surf.html
(Note, the URL may change.)

Begin excerpt

The impact of technology is not easily wrapped in a single bundle. Even as
Marinetti was careening down the streets of Milan, Marxists were gathering
strength elsewhere to bring down the oppressive system of the factory. As
Baudrillard and Virilio warn of imminent doom, the CyberUtopians and
Extropians hail the technological leaps that they hope will push mankind to
another level of development. 

End excerpt

The February 1997 issue of Communications of the ACM contains an article
which uses the word "extropic":

The Best of All Possible Worlds
by John Perry Barlow

Begin quote (see box page 71)

I imagine an intraspecies nervous system, made of glass and microwaves,
spreading to connect all the minds who wish to be connected to it, extracting
from those minds the extropic value of a new-world economy so subtle in its
expenditure of the planetary cupboard that we may actually be able to
survive here indefinitely and not merely for the five or six generations I
grew up thinking were all we could hope to squeeze from the leavings that

I've been thinking about this very issue lately:
Is there hope for the Meaning of Life?

And my conclusion:  Yes, but backing that statement up requires way,
way, way too much unpublished material.

My general conclusion is that engineering an ontologically objective
self-justifying goal requires solving both the First Cause and the hard
problem of conscious experience.

First, why engineering as opposed to discovering?
Because unlike the Universe and qualia, I have nothing to point to for
my "hard problem of ethics."

Second, why the First Cause?
So that we can make objectively real self-justifying things.

Third, why conscious experience?
Goal requires purpose.  Purpose requires agent.  Agent requires
subjectivity.  Therefore conscious experiences or, more likely, an
engineered variant thereof.

Probability of success:  Between 20% and 70%, depending on how
optimistic I'm feeling that day.

Depressing side-note:  Explains the Great Silence if all civilizations
achieve Singularity and commit suicide.  Better hope that intelligent
life is really improbable or that lightspeed is an absolute limit. 
Aren't wormholes and those newly discovered planets and life on Mars
depressing?  Personally, I go for the "really improbable" explanation.

Weird idea:  We, as future Powers, could resolve to destroy all of
Reality if we find out that life is meaningless.  If all others follow
the same logic, this reduces to zero the chance that previous
civilizations have destroyed (only) themselves, and thus increases the
chance that life is meaningful.

Practical conclusion:  If it all turns out to be meaningless, we can
commit suicide at leisure - but won't you feel stupid if it turns out
that you shouldn't have slit your wrists?
To sign up for cryonics, you don't need to know how the corpsicles will
be revived, or believe that they will be, just that there's even a 10%
chance of it working.

And to those who say:
"Summa nulla est,"
I say:
"Fac ut vivas."

Truth to tell:  for me, even a 0.1% chance is plenty to make it worth
signing up.  Any nonzero chance of revival is infinitely greater than
zero, which is what I'd have if I were buried or cremated.  And if I'm
frozen and it never works, I won't be around to know.

As I see it, life insurance can only get even close to being life
insurance if it's used to fund a cryonics contract.  Otherwise it's
death insurance.

But knowing the basic Answers doesn't mean knowing everything; we know the
rules of Game of Life and might even consider them simple, almost banal,
but I think most of us are surprised and delighted by the ever more
complex patterns that are invented or discovered (like prime-generating
patterns or bizarre flotillas). Reality seems to be chaotic/self-organizing 
in some deep sense, we cannot predict the higher levels from the lower 
levels. The traditional view of the TOE and Answers seems to have been 
quite linear: if you know them, you know everything that is to be known. 
I don't think so. 

And then there is the possibility of creation. I think this is the most
interesting field, and it will certainly help me avoid boredom: the
creation of new systems, new worlds. OK, we know the Meaning of Life, but
what if it was different? What is the simplest universe that can generate
systems equally complex to ours?

Boredom is in some sense a defense against getting trapped in a loop. If
we were never bored we would continue with our tasks ad infinitum or
circumstances forced us away from them (a clear disadvantage). As a SI I
woul probably want a way to regulate the "boredom threshold" of my
subminds; sometimes it is a good idea to have a system that can
enthusiastically go on with a task (Could you catalogue the stars of the
galaxy for me, submind 348843?), sometimes it is a good idea to quickly
move on to more rewarding fields (Submind 438733, take a look at the
civilizations in sector 43 and tell me if anyone of them looks
interesting).

In other words ethics are what we say they are. Even more that fire, ethics 
is the most important human invention, without it no other invention would 
be possible because we could not work together.
                      

        >Second, why the First Cause? So that we can make objectively real

One is a ridiculous number, so the idea that everything has a cause except 
for one thing seems very ugly and unsatisfying to me. That doesn't prove 
it's untrue of course, but I think it would be much more beautiful if lots of 
things had no cause, or even if cause and effect were in some sort of closed 
loop. I find it interesting that John Cramer's transactional interpretation 
of Quantum Mechanics does indeed blur the distinction between cause and 
effect.

It doesn't bother me that in an absolute sense the world has no purpose,  
because I don't think the question is even coherent, it's like asking  
"How long is a piece of string?". When talking about meaning and purpose you  
have to ask " purpose for who?". What is the purpose of a violin? To the 
manufacturer the purpose is to get a paycheck. To a drowning man its purpose  
is to act as a life-preserver. To a musician its purpose is to make music and 
to his tone deaf child its purpose is to be used to be used as a club to swat 
a bug. To a rock the violin has no purpose at all. Nothing means anything  
without an interpretation. This post doesn't mean anything, its  just a bunch 
of squiggles, until you use an interpretation, in this case the  rules of
language. Change the interpretation and the meaning changes.

Bacteria on Mars, if proven, would be a little unsettling, but there would  
still be a very long way go from there to intelligence and technology. 
I don't  think wormholes or the speed of light is relevant, even in the 
unlikely event that we can never go faster than we can right now, we could 
still send Von Neumann probes to every star in the Galaxy in less than 
100 million years and transform it beyond recognition, and that's not much 
time on a Cosmological time frame.

        >leisure 
                      

Why should a meaningless Universe make me depressed? It is my sincerest wish  
that I am correct and that the universe has no meaning, because then I would  
be free to give it any meaning I want, otherwise I'm stuck with a meaning I 
may not like one bit.  For example, suppose for a movement that religious  
people are correct and a Christian God does exist and the meaning of life is 
to praise him. Here we have an all powerful demon addicted to flattery who 
can read your every thought and will torture you, not for a long time, but 
for ETERNITY if you take one step out of line or break one of his many, many, 
rules, and that includes thought crimes. To make maters worse you're not even 
sure exactly what all his rules are, the "experts" all violently disagree, 
so you never know if you're going to be tortured or how to avoid it. Now this 
seems pretty depressing to me and not at all moral. I'll take an indifferent 
universe over a sadistic one any day.

Please let us in on which measure of complexity you are using, and
which instruments you used to carry out the measurement.

(I don't know about you, but I've known some pretty bad people in
my life--just a few--and I don't know what I would do if I was
offered a choice between saving just one of *these* people and
saving a few hundred acres of pristine Amazonian rain forest. If
I was acting *selfishly*, I would certainly go for the rain forest,
because I would enjoy that far more than I would enjoy one of these
people that I'm thinking of (and I rarely think of them).  Perhaps
you are luckier than I am and have never met any bad people in your
life.)

How do you know?

 >and whatever the

 >(or some similar ontologically engineered substance) as substrate.

Why? Aren't you being a little sophontocentric about the Meaning of Life?

Today I'm feeling more in agreement with Hal's contrarian post of
yesterday on environmental policy. The ethical concerns that motivate
environmentalism are so abstract, luxuriant, and upper-class that
I fear the aristocracies of the various nations on the planet are
going to use these concerns to squish the economic development of
the lower classes, particularly in the Third World. And I've always
thought the sight of comfortably upper-middle-class American and
European professors blathering about population control and population
explosions was just a pleasant display of sublimated racism. "We
got ours, now all you darkies just be good and get fixed and stay
at home, okay? And don't try to immigrate here either." Truly a
disgusting spectacle.

Anyone truly dedicated to the environmentalist cause should be
worrying about potential impacts from Near-Earth Objects and trying
to fix that first. A high-velocity comet could come swooping out
of the Oort Cloud any year, and we are sitting ducks along with
all the other species on this planet. But we're the only species
that can do anything about it, and what are we doing instead? I
have no idea. Engaging in mindless tax-and-waste games on a global
basis, I guess.

I am in general inclined to agree with Hal that I am willing to
trade off some current diversity of life-forms in order to insure
even greater future diversity of life-forms, and the insurance I
crave is the Diaspora of Life and Mind beyond this planet. In the
long term, what I want is more different kinds of people. As long
as there's enough action going on, and enough different kinds of
action, I'll probably find a satisfying niche somewhere. But if
the future is a monocrop, I doubt very much that it will be a
monocrop of anything I could get along with in friendly fashion.

I like some of those,

I wish it was not so easy.
That melanine thing worries me.
I hope I do not really need it.
I have not gotten much sun in the last few years.

I am cynical of other people's opinions,
and optimistic of my facts. :-)

I do'nt believe in freedom.
The universe is a prison I can never escape from.
I can forget about it though.
Ignorance might not be bliss,
but it sure is usefull when you get bored of omniscience.

The kinds of corporate shenanigans you describe *are* reflected in price
; that is in fact one of the subtleties of the price system that
anticapitalists don't understand.  For example, a news corporation such
as you describe is a less effective news corporation than one that
doesn't indulge in such practices.  In a free market, in the long run, it
will therefore fail (because if and when they are being rational,  part
of what people are buying when they buy news is real news).

I think I'm beginning to understand what you're on about.  Ian Banks' Culture
and all that, right?  A bit of Gibson, Sterling, Stephenson et al.?  (I
still don't understand why you use the word 'intrinsic', though.)

And how is Constructionist AI to find all this out? Some of the
variables reflected in price are simply not gatherable as information:
individuals' 'know-how', for instance.  Is the AI going to do a kind of
cyborg Vulcan mind meld or something: and would that be with peoples'
consent or without? Or is it just going to torture the information out
of people? You want to know something? Even if your AI tortured me to
find out how I'm able to drink a cup of tea, I still couldn't tell it!

All this has nothing to do with capitalism, though it might have
something to do with corporatism and mercantilism, if I understand you
correctly. We are not using words in the same way, I think.  To me, Capitalism
means free markets and a functioning price system in a context of the
rule of law (as opposed to the rule of men - or AIs). Where that doesn't
exist, you don't have capitalism. The systems we actually have in most
contemporary Democracies are mercantile semifascist /semisocialist with
a sprinkling of capitalism holding them together.

Society exists for the benefit of individuals, not for the benefit of
'society', of  Ordnung,  or of some AI's good housekeeping. It so
happens that individuals are creatures that need to make their own
choices and steer their own way through life, otherwise they get unhappy,
even more unhappy than they get when they've got too many choices and
have to steer their own way through life.  If your AI is going to take
away this liberty and plan society according to *its* vision of how
things should be, that is no different from any other dictator, and the
same flaws accrue, no matter how supposedly  'benevolent' or utilitarian
the dictatorship.

Can I make a suggestion?  Why not lay off the ganja for a couple of
weeks?  You'll really feel the benefit when you start smoking again! ;-)

Although I reflexively tend to agree with Pearce about the connection 
between boredom and evil, the belief in it is not due to hyperactive 
dopaminergic pathways.  I am a counterexample;  I take have to take
dopamine precursors such as tyrosine just to avoid being hypoactive.

I suspect that the agreement is motivated more by aesthetic sensibility
than neurotransmitter functioning.

I was going to let this thread die for lack of time, but Mr de
Lyser let me know by private mail that he was interested in seeing
my reply, and that he'd like to carry on the discussion in public.

I'm not forcing you to do anything. You just *chose* to defend
Lenin's Russia. As far as I'm concerned, any system in which I
could be taken from my home by the authorities without warning and
shot in the back of the head for no particular reason is a system
which does not work. So I dispute your assertion, as well as pinning
all the responsibility for making that assertion on you.

This is irrelevant because I haven't denied any such thing.

The only sense I can make of this is that you are assuming that
the state is necessary for redressing "counterproductive policies".
But this is vague. I have no interest in redressing anyone else's
counterproductive policies, as long as they don't mess with me, my
friends, or my stuff. There are problems involving commons,
externalities, and public goods, and some of these are severe
problems for local governments. But nearly all such things should
be handled by local governments, yet most tax funds in my country
go to the Federal government or to fulfilling Federal government
mandates. Are you saying that if someone chooses to engage in
"counterproductivity" on their own time and with their own stuff,
that the State should step in and "correct" them? Please be more
specific if this is not what you mean.

Assuring that "laissez faire" ideals "keep working somehow" doesn't
seem to be anything that any State that I know has been very
effective at doing. All that's needed is for people to refrain from
violating one another's persons and property, and the vast majority
of people do that anyway because it's how they want to be treated
by strangers. The few who do not do that anyway hardly require that
50% of the gross world product be spent on suppressing them, yet
that's how much (approximately) this planet spends on government.

It's not vague at all... it's a technical term from microeconomics. And
it is not true that all possible political systems legitimize the use of
violence to punish voluntary and consensual exchange. You seem to think
that I am defending some political system that is actually in practice
today. I am not. There are political systems that have been practiced in
the past that, with some fairly uncontroversial adjustments (mostly
liberalizing ones) would suit me better than the system I live under
now, but my political ideal is a new thing that has never been done
before, just as our ideal of eternal life is a new thing that has never
been done before.

I am perfectly content to abandon democracy. You'd better not
respond to this line, though, I hear that advocating such things
can land one in jail in Europe.

<irony>
Why spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, such as space
migration, intelligence increase, and life extension? Why not focus
on ones that are achievable instead, like cutting taxes while
at the same time improving state-provided medical care and education?
</irony>

There were certainly some actively transhumanistic people in Russia,
following in Tsiolkovski's footsteps. Some of them got out after
the revolution, and some of them stayed inside and tried to make
the best of things there, and I salute their courage for not just
giving up in the circumstances in which they found themselves. I
am *not* attempting to change the political system anyone else
lives under. I have seen political ideals, just ideas, do a *hell*
of a lot of damage in history, yet I do not believe in using force
to suppress political ideals with which I disagree. Because I will
not sanction the use of force to suppress such ideals, I thereby
feel what amounts to nearly an obligation to oppose those dangerous
ideals in argument wherever I encounter them. That's the basis of
my response to Jim Legg. I'm still not sure I understand why you
are objecting to the response I made to Jim Legg.

No. I honestly believe that that the State is an atavism, a left-over, a
self-perpetuating relic of the violence and warfare that routinely
characterized early Middle-Eastern civilization. I don't think war and
crime can be done away with eternally, but I think that the existence of
a system of nation-states causes more crime and warfare than it
prevents. I honestly believe this, so for you to rebuke my political
priorities for being "personal" or "selfish" is totally incorrect. If I
were truly selfish in my politics, I would have no interest in political
persuasion at all. I'd just avoid the state and let other people suffer.
Furthermore, I think it is the political structure of this planet that
consitutes the single greatest barrier to transhumanist goals. I do not
place a higher priority on political goals than on transhumanist goals,
instead, my sense of urgency about my political goals stems directly
from the fact that in my opinion implementing my political goals will
directly and immediately contribute to my chances of success in
implementing my transhumanist goals.

Someone must oppose that majority and raise that awareness. Where does
it start? Besides, I'd never have gotten to where I am now if I'd ever
spent much time worrying about whether or not other people thought I had
lost my "sense of reality", whatever that means. I've got a perfectly
good nervous system, and I'll take that over a "sense of reality" any
day.

What made you think I was espousing anything like this? I think you are
jumping to conclusions about what course of action I am endorsing. I
have no idea how to most effectively attack the state. Actually, I have
a few ideas, and the cypherpunks are already actively working on some of
them. There are other routes. None of them look particularly promising
by themselves, but with several different people working on several
different routes at once, perhaps things will improve over the long
term, just as they had been improving politically for hundreds of years
before the twentieth century. If I get any bright ideas that I don't
already see a lot of people working on, I'll let you know.

Of course it is based on their personal financial improvement. If enough
people got *sincere* about being interested in their personal financial
improvement they might study a little microeconomics and then it would
become quite obvious to them how the politicians are robbing them
blind. Perhaps I am playing a fool's game... perhaps the vast majority
of people are congenitally incapable of thinking in microeconomic terms.
I'll be sure to take a look at the study proving this as soon as it
comes out, but I won't change my tune before then.

I like Philip K. Dick's definition of reality: it's what doesn't
go away when you stop believing in it. (You'd be surprised how much
stuff turns out to be unreal under this definition.) On the other
hand, I also like Robert Anton Wilson's definition of reality: it's
what you can get away with. When you say the Eurocracy is real, I
don't think you're thinking long-term enough. From a very-long-term
perspective, these things are like clouds or mists, not like the
laws of physics. I'm also aware that people use this same argument
to try to get rid of the institution of private property, but I
think by now that we've run that particular experiment enough times
that we can stop repeating that mistake on empirical grounds. Every
time societies have tried to get rid of the state in the past,
they've started by trying to get rid of property. I think this is
a precisely ass-backwards way to approach anarchism.

Of course you need to treat the Eurocracy as real when deciding
what to do this week or this month. But I think it is a very bad
mistake to *assume* that the Eurocracy will be real in twenty years.
The state is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has gone on fulfilling
itself for thousands of years. Start breaking the chain. The state
is *just* a group of people who have arrogated certain privileges
to themselves, and that's all. Don't land yourself in jail, but at
the very least, you could try to curb your temptation to use statist
rhetoric, or to defend those who do so.  That would be a start.

There is a current Transhumans thread about nerve growth factors 
(which I don't have any info on).  But, I did notice a report in the 
25 January 1997 Science News about a novel antioxidant that was 
reported in the 21 Jan Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences.

The antioxidant is a nitrone known as PBN which may slow aging in the 
brain.  While the purpose of most antioxidants is to scavenge 
destructive free radicals, the Science news article noted that some 
free radicals are necessary "to eliminate invaders and unwanted 
tissues [and] also to synthesize many important compounds, including 
hormones". Unlike most antioxidants, PBN (which is being developed by 
Centaur Pharmaceuticals) supposedly has the advantage that it does not 
eliminate these useful functions of free radicals, only their harmful 
effects.

Hmm....well I misunderstood his statement then.  I apologize for the

If you don't need to hit it with a photon, then you aren't restricted by
the speed of light are you?

Con artists are on both sides, but while many of the cons on the right
are of a self deceptive nature, the ones on the left are ludicrous:

1)a toxic waste recycling plant in CA was shut down by the EPA because
they violated EPA regs that state that toxic waste cannot be recycled,
that it must be stored in 55 gallon drums.

2)fast food stores gave up using styrofoam because the EPA would not let
them recycle  the containers (made of 100% recyclable polystyrene)
because the styrofoam had once (GASP!!!) touched food!!!! Now they use
specially made containers that are not recyclable at all due to their
composite structure of paper, waxes, and plastic, but are using up many
old growth trees in the process.

3) the new head of the Sierra Club is advocating that the Glen Canyon
Dam be torn down, to rebuild the previous ecosystem, even though any
indigenous species exclusive to the original habitat are now extinct.
Doing so would cause the already high power rates, and regional power
deficits of the southwest to skyrocket, and mandate the building of
fossil fuel power sources, which will contribute even more to the
effects of global warming. Of course one wonders if maybe they are doing
it on purpose....

These are just a few, and, should people start shouting about ad
homenim, blah blah blah, I could do more research and come up with more,
as they do exist, of the completely insane things environmentalists do.

I have found that many if not most environmentalist groups are in
existence simply to raise funds by appearing to advocate rules and
regulations that have an initial apparent purpose of making somebody
else clean something up. They also typically wind up causing even more
environmental damage across the board than they prevented (just look at
the anti-nuke movement, which was incidentally funded by fossil fuel
companies).

If the russians had actually LISTENED to the so called 'capitalist

not have the assets to back was a road to chaos, they would not be in
the shithole they are in now.

Well, now, we see the "Big gaping hole" in your plan. The reason why
capitalism has succeeded for so long and ideas like communism failed, is
because capitalism works WITH human nature, while communism and I
suspect your idea, from what you've just said, stive against human
nature. Any engineer knows you get much better headway when you go with
the flow...

You have yet to demonstrate anything better than price. Talk is cheap.
Prove your idea is better first. I'm telling you the same thing half of
the people on this list told me regarding my drive system I'm
developing.

Legg: Btw, what sort of old email reader are you using that can't wrap

Mike:
I am using Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0. It works just fine. IF you are
using a newer one, it is probably indicative of a bug in your new system
than a fault in mine. Of course, it may also be another indication of
Microsoft's typical attitude of making other people's stuff annoying to
use with their stuff. I haven't used Outlook yet, but I have used
Exchange, and my recent experience with Front Page tells me that while
MS may add some nice new features, they typically overlook some major
flaws. For example, while its cool to be able to put tables within
tables in Front Page, it is extremely annoying to not be able to add
rows or columns onto an existing table, or to delete the last cell of a
table that is not needed. Exchange does not allow one to be able to use
a image file attached to an email message generated in Netscape.

Pfui.  A single galaxy?  Makes perfect sense that we're the First.  Just
requires, what, a billion stars per techie species?  Only on a
Universal, 10^22-star scale is it a bit worrisome.

Stop with the atheist hyperbole.  Not everyone who disagrees with you is
a slavering religious fanatic.  Having discussed that previously,
onwards.

Let me translate your proposal into formal ethical terms.  You do not
wish any goal to have inherently positive value, because then you would
be free to assign positive value to any goals you chose.

Now.  If no goal has positive value, but you assign goals positive
value, you would simply be wrong.  Try translating your proposal into
practical terms.  You are saying:  "I hope that there's no way to walk
across the room, because then I am free to assign to my actions whatever
walk-across-the-room-utility values I choose."  Presumably you will
choose to assign a high value, in terms of getting across the room, to
blowing your nose.  Now, in point of fact, blowing your nose will not
help you get across the room.

Your proposal *is* more intuitively appealing then the reductio above. 
This is because of instinctive us-vs.-them thinking, as your
John-vs.-God example demonstrated.  It seems preferable to choose your
own goals than to have them imposed.  But that is not the issue - or
rather, the issue goes beyond that.

When we "choose our own goals" instead of having them "externally
imposed", we are not choosing our *ultimate* goals.  We are choosing our
own goals in terms of which goals seem most desirable in terms of our
premanufactured, externally imposed ultimate goals, such as stimulation
of the pleasure centers.  And we do not want goals "externally imposed"
because they would conflict with our ultimate goal of stimulating our
pleasure centers.

If there isn't a real Meaning of Life, our ultimate goals will always be
externally imposed.  Always.  John K Clark wants there to be no meaning
to Life so he can assign high value to, say, exploring the galaxy.  And
he will want to assign high value to exploring the galaxy because he
thinks it will be fun.  And he thinks it will be fun, because evolution
says it will be fun.  So evolution is choosing John K Clark's goals for
him, in the absence of any real meaning to the Universe.

That example doesn't justify the "Always".  In formal ethical terms, no
Meaning means - by definition - that any existing positive-value goals
were imposed by external fiat, or derived from positive-value goals
imposed by external fiat, or Interim (having probabilistic value). 
Leave out the Interim; John K Clark is assuming that we know for *sure*
that all goals have zero inherent value; thus no Interim goals.  Thus
there is no conceivable reason for John K Clark wanting to assign
meaning to anything, which will not trace its roots to evolution. 
Either John K Clark will not know this, or he will know this and will
deliberately lie to himself.

By contrast, suppose the Meaning of Life is "new ideas".  I can discard
all externally imposed goals, deduce that the Meaning is "new ideas",
and set out, completely free from all coercion, to explore the Galaxy in
search of new ideas.

You see, the thing about Life being meaningless is that you couldn't
have any positive-value goals except through self-delusion motivated by
externally imposed falsely meaningful goals.  You'll choose your own
meaning?  By what criterion?  Life?  Joy?  Laughter?  But they won't be
meaningful.  In actual fact, they won't be meaningful.  So you'll be
lying to yourself.

I think what you really hope is that the Meaning of Life will *be* what
you want it to be, like "joy in newness" and not something you
*wouldn't* want it to be, like "worshipping God".  As you point out,
worshipping God is of no conceivable value to the Universe, once viewed
from the proper perspective.  What good is worship to God?  What good is
worship to anything?  So a bunch of people have, in their belief
systems, the idea that God is of positive value.  So what?  Who cares? 
What does it matter?  That can't be the Meaning of Life.

Try to get this straight.  If you can assign an absolute
(non-probabilistic) positive value to anything, without deluding
yourself or being motivated by externally imposed goals, that is the
Meaning of Life.  Maybe there's one, maybe there's a dozen, maybe they
conflict with each other and maybe they don't.  Maybe they're
observer-relative, maybe you can engineer them to be whatever you want
them to be.  Maybe you'll fall on your knees and maybe you'll explore
the Universe.

But.  You'll decide to do it.  Of your own free will.  Maybe the logic
is inexorable, and maybe it will conflict with previously established
goals, and maybe it leads to something you wouldn't want to face as you
are.  But it will still be you, and nothing imposed by God, man or
evolution, that makes the decision that this is, that this must be,
Right.

[Lorrey asks:]
> If you don't need to hit it with a photon, then you aren't restricted b=
y
> the speed of light are you?

Sure you do.  The way it works is that you "could have" hit it with a
photon, but you "didn't really" hit it with a photon.  For those readers
who do not savvy quantum counterfactuals, the five-minute explanation of
the basic counterfactual split-photon experiment:

                 1          =

                 |           Arrows indicate direction. =

       A/--------/---2       A single photon leaves START,
        |       D|           and is reflected from mirrors. =

        |C       |           What is the chance that the photon
START---/--------/B          will reach target 1, or target 2? =


There are four mirrors: {A, B, C, D}.  {A, B} are "fully silvered"
mirrors:  They always reflect a photon.  {C, D} are "half-silvered"
mirrors:  They reflect a photon 50% of the time.

Under "classical" physics, the sort we're used to seeing, the photon has
a 50% chance of being reflected from C.  If reflected from C, it will
bounce off A and thus reach D.  Now we roll the dice again:  It has a
50% chance of being reflected again and reaching 1, and a 50% chance of
reaching 2.  Thus, since the photon only has a 50% chance of going down
path A (the path intercepted by mirror A), the total contribution of
path a is a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.

Path B is likewise.  The photon has a 50% chance of going down path B. =

Then it reaches mirror D and has a 50% chance of being reflected and
reaching 2, and a 50% chance of continuing to 1.  So path B contributes
a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.

Summing up the contributions, we find that the chance of reaching 1 is
(25% + 25% =3D 50%), and that of reaching 2 is (25% + 25% =3D 50%).  Thus=
,
under classical physics, a photon has an equal chance of reaching A or
B.

Quantum physics is different, and weirder.  Probabilities in quantum
physics are measured by complex numbers, of the form (a + bi).  Now we
perform the calculation again, but this time, mirrors not only change
the *path* of the photon - assuming they reflect it - but they also
change the *phase* of the photon by 90=B0 or a quarter-turn.  In practice=
,
they multiply the probability of the photon being in a particular place
by i, the square root of negative one.  What this all means will soon
become clear.

Now recalculate the probabilities.  A photon is emitted from START, with
a probability of 1, or 1 + 0i, of being there.  It hits mirror C.  Now
the photon has (1 + 0i)*(i)=3D(0 + i) or i "probability" of going down
path A, and a 1 "probability" of going down path B.  In the branch of
reality in which the photon goes down path A, the photon hits the mirror
A and reflects again, so the photon now has an (i)*(i)=3D(-1) quantum
"probability" of getting to D.  The photon hits D and "splits" again,
part of it getting to target 2 (without being reflected) with a
"probability" of -1, and part hitting target 1 with a "probability" of
-i.  So far, therefore, the photon has a -1 "probability" of being at
target 2 and a -i "probability" of being at target 1.

Interlude:  The reason "probability" has quotes around it is because
there is no such thing of a -50% chance of something happening.  In
quantum physics these are called probability amplitudes.  We will soon
see how probability amplitudes are converted to genuine, normal,
positive, real, probabilities.  But for now, don't be concerned by
probabilities like -1.

Now let's continue with the branch of reality in which the photon goes
down path B, with a probability of 1.  It gets reflected by B, and
continues with a probability of i.  It gets to D.  Along one branch, it
is not reflected and gets to target 1 with a probability of i.  Along
another branch, it is reflected and gets to target 2 with a probability
of (i)*(i)=3D(-1).  So for branch B, the contributions are an i
probability of getting to target 1 and a -1 probability of getting to
target 2.

Now we sum the branches of reality, just like with normal
probabilities.  Branch A gives a -i probability of getting to target 1,
and branch B gives an i probability.  i + -i equals 0.  They cancel
out.  There is probability amplitude zero of getting to target 1. =

Branch A and branch B both give -1 probability amplitude of the photon
getting to target 2.  -1 + -1 =3D -2, for a -2 probability amplitude of
the photon getting to 2.

Now convert probability amplitudes to probabilities.  This we do by
taking the "squared modulus", which for a complex number (a + bi), is
equal to a squared plus b squared, or (a * a) + (b * b).  The chance of
getting to target 1 is 0, or zero squared plus zero squared.  The chance
of getting to target 2 is 4, or -2 squared plus zero squared.  4 chances
of getting to target 2, 0 chances of getting to target 1, so there's a
100% chance of getting to target 2.

That is, quantum physics says that instead of a 50% chance of getting to
either target, every single photon "splits" into two separate branches
of reality, goes down *both* paths, *interferes* with *itself*, and
winds up at target 2.

But suppose we remove mirror C, so that all photons go down path B?  Or
suppose we place a rock in the middle of path A?  Then the two paths no
longer cancel out.  There's an i probability of getting to target 1, for
a (1*1) or 1 chance of getting there.  There's a -1 probability of
getting to target 2, or (-1*-1)=3D1 chance of getting there.  A 50% chanc=
e
of getting to either target.

What's worse, just *measuring* the photon will influence the probability
that it gets to its target - even if it doesn't deflect the photon by so
much as an inch.  Because when you measure a system, all probability
amplitudes are *immediately* converted to probabilities and the system
"collapses" or is "reduced" to a single branch of reality.  The photon
is suddenly in only one place in only one branch of reality.  This is
known as "the collapse of the wavefunction" or "state-vector reduction".

So if we replace mirror A with a "measuring device" that reflects the
photon as usual, but also lights up a little device that says the photon
has passed, the photon has a 50% chance of reaching target 1 or 2, just
like in classical physics.  Because when mirror A measures the system -
when hit by a photon in the branch of reality where the photon goes down
path A - the system is "reduced".  The photon has an i probability of
being on path A, and a 1 probability of being on path B.  Squared
amplitudes - 1 chance A, 1 chance B.  So the photon will wind up on
either A or B with a 50% chance - but not on both A and B with i and 1
probability.  There are no longer two branches of reality.  The photon
does split again when it reaches target 1 or target 2, but it has a -1
probability for 1 and an i probability for 2, which works out to 50/50
again.

As you'll recall from way back in the beginning, you can use this trick
to observe an object without touching it.  Take the Elitzur-Vaidman
bomb-testing problem.  We have been supplied with a large number of
bombs, with detonators so sensitive that a single photon reflecting from
one will set off the bomb.  The problem is that most of our bombs are
duds.  The detonating mechanism doesn't work.  And it's impossible to
test the detonating mechanism without reflecting a photon from it. =

Question:  How do you produce a bomb that is guaranteed to work...
without blowing yourself up?

Answer:  This problem, as presented, is *impossible* in classical
physics.  But quantum physics can provide a solution. =


Replace mirror A... with a bomb.  Since the bomb constitutes a
"measuring instrument" - that is, it blows up if a photon strikes it,
but doesn't blow up otherwise - the photon now has a chance of
reflecting off B, and winding up at target 1.  (And an equal chance of
reaching target 2... and of course it's only 50% that it reaches
*either* target instead of blowing up the bomb.)

Thus we can determine whether the bomb is a measuring instrument
*without* *even* *touching* *it*!  However, although you can measure
something without a photon having touched it in that branch of reality
which turns out to be real, it still has to be possible that the photon
*could* have touched it, or rather it has to be the case that the photon
*did* touch it in an alternate branch of reality.  Thus this trick does
not, Mike Lorrey, constitute FTL.

On the other hand, if you have a photon that is 'locked' to the one
inside the system, but in another galaxy, measuring the Andromeda photon
will cause the photon in the experimental apparatus to collapse as
well.  Once collapsed, it has a chance of reaching target 1, which it
did not have before.  Thus if you can achieve this sort of 'lock',
which, as I understand, you can - using the recent discovery as reported
in SciAm, you can synchronize the quantum states of large numbers of
photons - you have instantaneous communication, somebody wins a Nobel
Prize, and all hell breaks loose in the field of physics.

Even if you can't 'lock' photons, the experimentally confirmed Bell
inequalities demonstrate that performing a *particlar* measurement can
influence the outcome of another measurement performed on the other side
of the galaxy.  There are various reasons why you can't use Bell to
transmit information, but any way you look it at, quantum mechanics and
relativity are having screaming catfights.

I hope that cleared everything up.

New Element Discovered

   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
   physicists. The element, tentatively named Bureaucratonium, has no
   protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it
   does have
   
   1 neutron
   125 assistant neutrons
   75 vice neutrons
   111 assistant vice neutrons
   
   This gives it an atomic mass of 312. The 312 particles are held
   together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
   meson-like particles called morons.
   
   Since it has no electrons, Bureaucratonium is inert. However it can be
   detected chemically as it impedes every action with which it comes in
   contact. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of
   Bureaucratonium caused one reaction to take four days to complete when
   it would have normally occurred in less than one second.
   
   Bureaucratonium has a normal half-life of approximately three years,
   at which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes a
   reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and
   assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that
   atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.
   
   Research at other laboratories indicates that Bureaucratonium occurs
   naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points
   such as government agencies, large Internet Service Providers, large
   corporations and universities and can usually be found in the newest,
   best appointed and best maintained buildings.
   
   Scientists point out that Bureaucratonium is known to be toxic at any
   level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction
   where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to
   determine how Bureaucratonium can be controlled to prevent
   irreversible damage, but results to-date are not promising.

I think you mean "new true ideas" here as opposed to "new false ideas."  I
think you are getting at this when you then say:

<If you can assign an absolute (non-probabilistic) positive value to
anything, without deluding yourself or being motivated by externally

Avoiding delusion is avoiding "new false ideas."  You do not need to rule
out being motivated by externally imposed goals in order to have meaning,
as long as you exercise free will in choosing to be so motivated.  For
example, if we have a homeostatic genetic regulatory system designed to
promote our survival until we reproduce, we do not *have* to be motivated
by this externally imposed goal.  We can always off ourselves by free will.

Seeking "new true ideas" sounds like the perennial favorite, the desire for
knowledge of self, others and the environment.  The next question is,
knowledge to do what and why?  If "new true ideas" or knowledge is the
object you are purposefully seeking, what is the source of the object and
why not seek it?

Actually, Bell's inequality has been experimentally proven to be false,

Also true. If I want to send a message to a receiver 2 things must happen:  
1) I must change something in the receiver. 
2) The receiver must be able to compare that change with something, such as   
the voltage on a wire now compared to what it was a nanosecond ago.

Quantum Mechanics can do #1 but not #2 , so I have just changed one "random" 
state in the receiver to another. The results are not really random but it 
would sure look that way to the receiver. It's only when the receiver  
compared his results with the records of what I did, and that can only be  
done at the speed of light or less, would it become obvious that what I did
instantly changed what happened in the distant receiver.
               

        >but any way you look it at, quantum mechanics and relativity are

Relativity doesn't say that nothing can go faster than light, only that 
matter, energy or information can not, and this is none of those things.

While this is true, I don't think it is the most informative way to view
the situation.  Collapse of the wave function is not purely a matter of
acquiring information.  It requires interacting with the system.

Here is Eliezer's very useful diagram, for reference below:

In the case of the hypothetical measuring device which collapses the wave
function, it may be OK for it not to "deflect the photon by an inch,"
but it nevertheless will interact with and affect the photon.  If your
measuring device were somehow able to measure (some aspect of) the photon
without altering its quantum state in any way, it would not destroy the
interference, and the photons would continue to all take path 2.

Consider this hypothetical experiment.  Let the beam splitter C work on
the basis of polarization.  Horizontally polarized photons go through
path A, and vertically polarized photons go through B.  This will work
the same as was described; the photons will be recombined and all will
take path 2.  We can send in photons of any polarization and this will
happen.  With a diagonally polarized photon it in effect has an equal
chance of choosing either path (or you could say that it goes equally
down both paths in some virtual sense).

Now, create a pair of photons in correlated states as in the EPR
experiment, both diagonally polarized, but such that they will both
produce the same result when their vertical/horizontal polarization
is measured.  Send one into the experiment above, and send the other
into another copy of the experiment.  In each case the photon passes
through its instance of the experiment and comes out path 2.

Now block path A in the second experiment.  The photon in that experiment
comes out path 1 or is absorbed.  We know which path it is following,
and there is no interference with its "other half".  What happens in
the first experiment?  We know which path the photon is taking from
the results of the second experiment.  In effect, we are measuring the
photon path without disturbing it.  What will happen?  Will the photon
still always head out path 2, or will it sometimes head out path 1 as
when we measured it directly?

My understanding is that if you work out the math and/or do the
experiment, you will find that measuring the other photon doesn't
change how this one behaves (indeed, if it did, that would be FTL
communication).  This photon continues to go out path 2, even though
you now know which path it is going down every time.

This is really very logical.  Your second experiment is basically just
being used to measure the vertical/horizontal polarization of the
photon.  Once you have done so, the paired photon can be thought of
simply as vertically or horizontally polarized.  Since sending either
of these two kinds of photons into the experiment leads to them
coming out path 2, it should not be a surprise that measuring the remote
photon leads to this result.

However this shows that there is more going on here than a simple
model where the photon must take both branches in order to interfere
with itself and leave on path 2.  Eliezer is right that if you
measure that photon within the experiment in order to determine
which path it is taking, you will destroy the interference and allow
it to leave on path 1.  What is wrong is to say that this is because
the measurement collapses the wave function.  Rather, the reason this
happens is because the measurement perturbs the state of the photon.
That is the point I want to get across, which for some reason the
authors of most articles on the strangeness of QM are reluctant to
discuss.

Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean.  I mean that "The conclusion drawn
from the thought experiment known as "Bell's inequality", that there are
no inequalities, has been experimentally confirmed."  Slip of the
keyboard.

You and William Seager.  Quantum collapse is "noncausal but
information-laden", says Seager.  Relativistic constraint only applies
to causality, not information.  Or maybe it's the other way around?  You
should read his "Consciousness, Information, & Panpsychism" sometime. 
He also uses reasoning that seems pretty similar to that flowchart of
consciousness you drew once.

I must say that I find rather attractive the idea that you can exert a
causal influence without transmitting information.  (For various
reasons, I prefer to reverse Seager's conclusion.)  *Even if you can use
it to communicate, you can still argue that you're not really
transmitting information.  You're only influencing probability
amplitudes; the quantum collapse itself disrupts the causal continuity
of the information by interposing a random, fundamentally non-causal
event.*  [Idea in asterisks my own.]  As an explanation, it has the aura
of inexplicable but internally consistent weirdness that often
characterizes the truth about basic physical reality.

In "Engines Of Creation" Drexler assumes that a nano computer with
human-brain capacity can be made with the size of 1 cm**3. We could then
all "download" to one of these brains. We can then make a body wich will be
about 7 cm high (3 inches) and all the over-population problems can thus be
solved.
As good Extropians and Transhumans this will not satisfy the members on
this list. We will most certainly develop a brain with at least twice that
capacity. As the curious people we are, we will use the extra brain
capacity to become even smarter. We will thus become "micro-professors".
Networking will then become a social problem not a technical issue with
protocols and what have you. "Online universities" will become a thing of
the past. The hot trend will be in "inline universities".
Of course there will be some ethical questions when it comes to parallel
professing, and how many micro-professors it will be ethically safe to put
in a single computer.

I'm pretty shure though that micro-professors wil lead to an new age in
intelligent computing and artificial intelligence.

Lets change the extropian slogan for it to fit to this new age...

Article in this weeks New Scientist (8th Feb'97 pp32-36) on a class of 
neurochemicals called ampakines (of which there are several hundred. Work 
done at University of California at Irivne by Gary Lynch and Gary Rogers 
has confirmed substantial enhancement of learning in older rodents. Even 
better, human tests have already begun, and initial reports indicate 20% 
increases in short-term recall for men in their 20s, and increases of 
over 50% in people over 60. Long term recall is also apparently enhanced, 
but no figures are quoted. Further, there is a good explanation of the  
mechanism, which could lead to improved compounds in the future.

I suspect there will be more info at http://www.newscientist.com in a

I think aversion to boredom is more complex than simply overactive 
dopaminergic pathways (if we ignore novelty-seeking behavior linked to 
D2), and might very well be due to cognitive or aesthetic factors. Still, 
what do we know about the neurochemistry of boredom? It would seem to me 
that it would be quite reasonable to postulate some system that reacts to 
low levels of novelty or progress, and starts signalling other systems 
with a need for change.

If you asked me a year ago, I would completely have agreed with you. But 
now I have been taking up exercise, and have noted an increase in 
alertness and efficiency. I no longer see any conflict between mental 
ability and physical ability, it is mainly a matter of correct time 
management (and if I can get my hands on a good wearable system, I will 
make them overlap even more).

Sunlight promotes synthesis of vitamin D and lowers daytime levels of 
melatonin (= you become more awake and positive). Having plenty of 
melanine probably protects you from melanomas, which is a good thing.

Of course, sunlight might not be as essential for you if you live at 
southern latitudes as it is for us swedes, who have a distinct lack of it 
during winter (and seems to have built up a psychological dependency on 
it in the summer).

Don't be so sure... the more I become a moravecian platonic materialist,

I am to some degree the product of my environment. But i do think they are
getting less socialistic, even if maybe more authoritarian. 
The last decade they have started to privatize many former state
institutions (railroads, phone companies, postal services, etc) you can't
deny that. Even though taxes may have been raised, they have cut many
social institutions (education !, health care, welfare and pensions,
subsidies to agriculture etc.)   

I have always been thought that a more Socialist Europe was necessary in
the cold war era, to suppress revolutionary elements, being so close to the
communist states, regionally.   

Now that the period is over, is it not logical to see things turning back a
little ?

Yes, The National Governements claim to shrink their power, by shifting
responsabilities to the European council, to provincial govt's, and to
cities/communities (and in some cases federal govt to national govts like
in belgium, which has recently become a federal state incorporating two
seperate countries.) Instead it's just more people raising more taxes
(especially local, city taxes). They have even come up with "Euregional"
bodies, (overlapping national borders) i wonder what their infuence will
be. Europe is consolidating it's internal political power, problem is that
many national govt's are struggling not to give theirs up, where some
regional govt's are taking their chance, and are stimulating all kinds of
long forgotten local nationalism (Italy, Belgium etc, ) so for the next 25
years or so, we'll have at least two or three large institutions sucking us
dry...

In any case there's a real power transformation going on here. A united
Europe will probably realize itself, but a few national govt's may be able
to hang on to their power and cede, whereas some local nationalist
movements might form their own state, either within or outside the European
community...

My guess is a true European State, is another century or so away, when
everybody has learned to speak English, (or german ?).

question is, what will happen to those poor remaining monarchs ? ;-)

Again this happens in many political systems, most states are autoritarian
to some degree. There are those who choose to change such a system by
compromise, and there are those who get shot in the head, in these systems.
I'd sooner prefer to be of the first kind, than of the second, as people
who get shot in the back of the head, change nothing.

Aha, so you're not an anarchist, just a separatist ? The independant state
of southern California ? In our private mail we discussed your (and my)
ideal for an independant chunk of rock orbiting sol, for you and your
friends to build your own way of life. Does this involve cutting off
relations with the rest of humanity ? I'm sorry but this makes the
extropian ideal of space colonization look like a disguised form of
isolationism, instead of expansion. How 'entropic' ?

In extreme cases yes. What is the Anarcho Capitalist view on patents for
example ? I can imagine situations where ones 'ownership' of technological
processes, genetic codes etc, limits free trade and the freedom of the
individual, can't you ? 

example: person A owns sythesised Gen X, he uses it for his product M in
bioindustry. Gen X can also be used to enhance certain chemical processes
in the human body. Person A has no intention of making it available to a
minority market of strange people who want to use it ( ;-) ). Person B, C,
and D have all suggested licencing the rights, but person A, won't hear of
it. 

I can see where people want to keep these to themselves, to create a trade
monopoly. You agree that monopolies are counterproductive ? Ofcourse
abandoning all patents and ownership rights on technology, would severely
limit R&D investement. Maybe a compromise should be found, who enforces

agreed, states have their own interests, i'm very interested in rotating
democratic systems like in Athens, where no one holds his position long
enough to create 'state interests'. Ofcourse qualification tests are a must

I agree with the basics, but what you're suggesting here is a governement
trimmed down to only functioning on justice/ military/police levels, in
fact a police state. I wonder what strange and possibly dangerous people
would be leading such a state.

The vagueness i was refering to was the possibility of conflict between
"voluntary" and "consensual".

I'm sorry, but this is an obvious example of why i refered to your replies,
in the way i did, in our private mail. You're subtly suggesting here that
the two are to be linked by definition. Linking your personal political
convictions to extropic ideals. I hope you see my reasoning now, for the
conclusion i made earlier.

realistic goals: majority of the people of earth are with you on

unrealistic goal: minority of people are with you on creating an agorist

Would you put your ideals of free trade before or after your ideals of

as i mentioned before, people project their sense of logic and  rationality
on their own political environment. Jims ideas were perfectly logical and
rational to HIM. I was objecting to the lack of understanding of that, in
general by replies from several people on this list. I may become a mild
libertarian, after some time spent on this list, as its ideas do interest
me a lot, but never, that is NEVER, will i let political ideals form an
obstacle for Transhumanist cooperation and communication. Something with
which not everybody on this list seems to agree. P.S. Jim has left us...

I'll remind you of that, when i come to conquer your planet with my space

true, i just hope you appreciate people who have the same (transhumanist)

Extropians,  I found the advise given to Mike Cowar on how to deal with
his God-fearing Christian parents by various Extropians to the effect:
submit to their will, pretend to be the faithful God-fearing son,  seek
appeasment, just make believe that you still subscribe to their belief
system,  very interesting.  I just wonder how people continue to pretend
to believe in various mandatory belief systems, such as God, JC, an
immortal, metaphysical soul etc. to avoid censor or ostracism from
family members or in the case of  politician their constituency.  Is
there any American politician that publically avows to being an atheist?
 Do we just go on pretending to be what everyone else expects us to be
during our lives, having dual belief systems, one for show and the other
privately held?  Is this not the case with some Extropians in regard to
environmental beliefs?  As soon as they read someone like Julian Simon,
their socially acceptable environmental beliefs change course.  Just
another probing question from Cyber Ed.

PLEASE NOTE:  By the time you tan, it's too late.  See references below

Skin sensitivity to sunlight is controlled by the genetic ability of an
individual to produce melanin....
(http://cric.chemres.hu/POL/ASP_Home/asp_bro2.html)

The average white skin can only produce melanin for 15 minutes a day (New
South Whales Cancer Council, 1987).

Skin cancer is usually a disease of white-skinned people. If your skin is
naturally brown or black you have some built-in sun protection and risk of
skin cancer is lower. (http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm)

The lighter your skin colour, the less melanin your skin can make... and
the easier it can be damaged by UV rays.
(http://www.mb.doe.ca/ENGLISH/AIR/HLWS/health1/skin2.html)

...it takes several days for the body to produce this extra melanin.
(http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm)

In some senses, suntans are "protective," but contrary to most people's
belief, they do not prevent sun induced skin damage....
A suntan is your bodies protective response to a harmful environmental
stimulus. When you have a tan, you have exposed yourself to lots of harmful
sun rays. (http://healthed2.shs.vt.edu/sun.html)

There is no such thing as a healthy tan: a suntan, not to mention a
sunburn, is an indicator of skin damaged by the sun. A suntan results from
the pigmentation change of melanin, the body's reaction as it tries to
protect itself from further sun damage.
(http://www.pluggedin.org/info/info.html).

Staying in the shade will not prevent skin damage; the UVA and UVB rays
reflect off sand, snow, water, roads, and buildings and UV rays penetrate
clouds and "haze".  (ibid.)

Even tanning slowly and carefully is dangerous. Darrell Rigel, M.D.,
clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University,
Manhattan, maintains, "There's no such thing as a safe tan. That's the
key point. You have to think about why you tan. The body senses that it
is being injured by UV radiation and, to protect itself, it produces
melanin." (http://freenet.uchsc.edu/2000/prevent/cancer/suntan/skin.html)

The upshot:  I'd suggest that unless you have a clinical vitamin D
deficiency you get enough sun.  I ran by a couple of ads for melanin-
based sunblock as I looked for these references.  It occurs to me that
using early genetic engineering it may be that increasing melanin in
the skin is easier than repairing/replacing damaged cells constantly.
During the time between then and full-scale nanotech/uploading, dark
skin may become quite fashionable as a longevity treatment.  I think
that at that point a fair measure of a person's IQ (irony quotient)
could be how loud and long they laugh at that prospect.

  I read a story once that refers more to pretend action than pretend
belief but still seems relevant here.

  After an announcement of a new communist strategy in some little
Russian town, and a mention of The-Genius-Of-Times Stalin, all the
audience raised themselves from their seats for a standing ovation.
They started clapping their hands with great force and enthusiasm,
and shouting in admiration of the Leader.  The storm of applause
wouldn't subside as everybody wanted to show himself at least as
enthusiastic as everybody else - and NOBODY wanted to stop first,
or even appear tired - as there were lots of agents watching them,
and the consequences for them would be tragic.  After a VERY long
time everybody felt exhausted, fake, ridiculous and scared to death,
but they couldn't stop.   Whether anybody still believed in what
they were doing, is a moot point - they had to continue demonstrating
it.

  After a while it ended, with somebody stopping this insanity first
(he was sent to labor camps right after the meeting), and others
sighing with relief and sitting down.

  After such things are over, each of the participants claims
the same thing - it was the pressure of the environment, they did
what they could to resist, but what could they do alone...
An interesting thing is to watch people when the mandatory behavior
patterns swing back and forth a few times.  Each time they claim
that they always were for the current thing.

  Also, nobody apologizes for either instilling wrong beliefs, or
following them, and nobody rewards people who fought to turn things
around.  Which makes one wonder whether it's worth one's time trying
to fight for the Right Beliefs.

Precisely... personally intelligence, or rather a desire for achievement
(I've met plenty of really smart people who never did anything with it),
is an extremely important part of attraction for me, but most people rate
it pretty low on the scale.

A number of people seem to be confusing our discussion of how the majority
of people see scientists with how the people on the list see them. Few
people turn their heads to watch when most scientists walk down the
street. That's not to say that a scientist can't be extremely attractive,
but they're going to have to work at it.

Frank,

You might be interested in checking out one of my articles that just came
out in Nature (Prakash, Cohen-Cory, and Frostig, June 20, 1996, p.
702-706).  I topically applied NGF to the somatosensory cortex of
anesthetized rats and imaged the activity of neurons evoked by whisker
stimulation. We found that NGF rapidly (within 20 min), but transiently
(returning to baseline within 1 hour) enhanced the cortical response to
whisker stimulation.  

This may not be the "negative" effect you are seeking, but the broader
implications remain to be shown--if it enhances evoked responses in the
somatosensory cortex what else might it enhance? pain sensations (i.e. a
central mechanism for hyperalgesia)? agitation? other sensory or motor or
hypothalamic pathways?

Subject: NGF: exogenous, intracerebral, intraventricular etc.

A few years ago, Don Stein reported that intracerebral administratioon
of NGF improved pperformance of rats with cerebral lesions, but not
normal rats; indeed, may have impaired performance of normal rats.

He remarked on how little study of this there had been, but his own
work has gone in a slightly diffeent direction (big focus on hormonal
effects on recovery from brain lesions, especially estrogen and
progesterone), so I am asking for any info about replications,
extensions, other possibly relevant phenomena.

DOES ANYBODY KNOW OF SUBSEQUENT STUDIES INVOLVING INTRACEREBRAL
OR INTRAVENTRICULAR ADMINISTRATION OF NGF IN NORMAL ANIMALS?

Also: not likely that anyhone would ut NGF into brains of normal human
volunteers, BUT in cases of experimental treatment of neurological
cconditions (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism, etc.) which may have
reported "no effect" (or maybe were NOT reported, because of "no
effect), are there any you know of in which a DETRIMENTAL effect was in
fact observed?

I know oof at least one recent report of hyperalgesia, after PERIPHERAL
injection, but this is not what I'm interested in.  I'm looking for
reports of perhaps very subtle decrements in performance, after central
administration, in humans or rodents, or--??

This is the old "breathing is a trespass" argument against anarchism,
and it holds some merit.  The reason it fails is just plain economics:
redressing such microscopic grievances costs more than tolerating them.
A monopoly government typically imposes its own standards of trespass.
Punching a man in the nose will likely get you arrested for assault;
tapping him on the shoulder to ask the time probably won't, but these
actions are clearly matters of degree, not kind.

When the redress of grievances is placed in the free market, solutions
will be arrived at that are the most efficient for the circumstances
without the nedd for external control.  Each protection agency (assuming
for the moment a Friedman-like system) will set its own "deductables"
of harm, and they will tend to settle into those values that cause it
to attract enough business without costing too much in effort.  It is
likely that the agencies will all find similar levels that best suit
human nature and the technology of the day.

This is actually an area of contention: Freidman believes in intellectual
property law pretty much as it exists today, with copyrights and patents
(for a more detailed view, his essay "Standards as Intellectual Property"
is on his web site at http://www.best.com/~ddfr/).  I and others do not.
I personally believe that scarcity is a fundamental irreducible attribute
of property, and therefore things like contractual privileges and names
(i.e., trademarks) are property, but pure copyrights and patents are not.
Nor do I accept the popular justification that they are necessary to
encourage creation and invention--they do no such thing, they just
manipulate the market into preferring forms of invention that we have
become accustomed to.

In human beings, the capability to be more than hunter-gatherers lies
in our ability to communicate and cooperate toward goals.  Precisely
because of this, our future is necessarily shaped by political ideals
more than by any other factor: politics is the normative philosophy of
human interaction.  My future will be shaped not only by my own actions,
but by those with whom I exchange ideas, engage in trade, and those who
stand in my way.  Current political systems stand in my way, and those
who act as apologists for the state earn my contempt and enmity, and it
is worth my effort to change their minds.

Fortunately, UV radiation seems to be quite low when the sun is below 30
degrees above the horizon, so that is the best time to get your
mood-enhancing sunlight.

Yes, it is.  "Social Conscience" assigns rights to an entity called
"society" which deserves no rights, and takes them away from enities
that do deserve them: individuals.  At the same time, it destroys
individual responsiblity.  

An eight-year-old can understand the difference between a set and its
members; you cannot perform operations on one that you can on the other.
A set of people is not a person.  A person has will, and can act for
his own benefit.  When you create "society", and assign it rights, you
have given rights to an entity with no means or will to exercise them,
and no way to benefit from them.  Therefore, it must take from certain
individuals and give to others, and cannot be held accountable for
either.  Even its laudable goals such as helping the unfortunate wind
up in the hands of faceless bureacracies blindly following rules, taking
by force and doling out by formula.  Compassion at gunpoint is not
human compassion.

"Social Conscience" is an evil, not because its goals are evil, but
because it does not--it cannot possibly--achieve those goals as well
as individual rights and responsibility can.

So what? The question under discussion in the paragraph you are
responding to was whether or not Lenin's Russia was a political
system that "worked". Are you still claiming that it was?

This is precisely the sort of question that led to the old list
rule against arguing the basics. (Please see the discussion of this
question in the FAQ at http://www.pobox.com/~arkuat/extr/faq/topics.html)
There are whole books on anarchocapitalist and classical-liberal
theory, and it is unreasonable of you to ask me to regurgitate them
for you on a mere mailing list. You could go for the radical, such
as David Friedman's THE MACHINERY OF FREEDOM, or the moderate such
as Friedrich Hayek's THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY. There are other
books as well.

Who said anything about isolationism? I believe in free trade and
free migration, open borders. If you want to continue this discussion,
you might want to be a little more cautious about jumping to
conclusions that misrepresent my positions, or I will cut and run
with a clear conscience. There is no point in trying to have political
discussions with people who have no idea what one another are talking
about.

I don't live in Southern California, because the weather down there
drives me crazy. I live in the Bay Area up north, where it is nice
and foggy, just the way I like it. And I promise I won't mix up
Antwerp with Brussels, okay? You live in Brussels, which is central,
and most of the people there speak French, but the surrounding
countryside speaks Flemish, right? (If I got this wrong, it's because
I'm relying on my memory and not a reference book.)

I think that the best practical path to world anarchy from where
we are now is goes *through* and *past* devolution of power from
imperial bodies to local governments, but I am a political
opportunist...  I'll take whatever path I can get. I don't pretend
to be anything but utterly ignorant about the future evolution of
our culture, including our political culture. Perhaps you are
confusing me with a constructivist-rationalist (this is a term from
Hayek). I am, instead, a critical rationalist.

I don't think abandoning patents would limit R&D investment at all. I
have no idea what "the anarchocapitalist view" on patents is, because I
am not the Pope of anarchocapitalism. As for me personally, I'm an
intellectual property agnostic. I think patents and copyrights are
probably a bad idea, possibly along with limited-liability corporate
structures, and that all these things are creatures of the State. I'm
not sure how one might recreate them in the absence of the State, but I
doubt that they would be a big net loss. At the same time, I may very
well be earning a living off of copyright someday, and I guess I'll just
have to be opportunistic enough at that time to avoid being too troubled
about it ethically. And then Lee Daniel Crocker can skewer me in our
next debate about moral philosophy.  ;)

Not at all! I'm suggesting a polycentric, pluralistic, system of
competing protection and arbitration agencies, funded by insurance
premiums, whose business is the protection of their clients from
thugs and looters, and who do *not* hold monopolies on their markets
that way States do. Now if you have any questions about this stuff,
please direct them to someone else, or go read Friedman. I know it
is very annoying to have somone shoot book titles at you instead
of explanations, but really, Mr. Friedman has already done some
very excellent work explaining these things, and it would be sheer
wasted effort for me to duplicate his work. And if Mr. Friedman is
too radical or too "American" for you, then I recommend Friedrich
Hayek.

Voluntary means all parties are involved through their own "free will".
Consensual means that all parties have consented to be involved in the
interaction. How can these two notions conflict? Perhaps when I said
"consensual" you were thinking "consensus". This is emphatically *not*
what I had in mind. When I say "consensual" I am speaking of consent,
not of consensus. Two very different things. Consent respects the
individual, whereas insistence upon consensus makes holders of minority
opinions feel as if they are sabotaging the process. This is why I have
no respect for social systems that require consensus. I highly value
diversity of opinion and belief, and insistence upon consensus squashes
that while insistence upon consent protects and preserves it.

Who cares? I only want to be able to live in the society of those
people. We only actually live in the society of a few hundred people at
a time... we can't really keep track of more than that. Relations of
trade we can carry on with strangers, and with people who have different
political beliefs. That is what the institutions of trade are for...
to enable us to cooperate with people that we would not choose to
socialize with. I don't know why you are assuming that everyone must
live under the same political system... I don't know why you are
assuming that it is irrational for me to hold certain political beliefs
unless they are shared by 51% of the world population. It is precisely
because I think minority societies should be allowed to select their own
political systems that I oppose an overarching world state.

I was trying to explain, in an abbreviated and compressed manner, to Jim

common transhumanist goals.

I don't understand how you can make such assertions with such confidence
given that you have never studied microeconomics. This stuff is
considered "the basics" on this list, always has been, and you might as
well get used to it. If you want to argue politics on this list, you
have to show some understanding of microeconomics. Trying to do
otherwise is like trying to strategize the development of the solar
system without having any idea what "delta-vee" and "albedo" mean.

I *know* that it is very rude and unpleasant for me to make assertions
such as that in the previous paragraph... that is exactly why I
chose not to develop this thread until you asked me to by private
mail. If you want to discuss this stuff with me in depth, then I'm
afraid I'm going to have to ask you to brush up on post-Marxist
economics (Marshall, Pareto, the Austrians, etc.) because otherwise
the terms that I use will seem "vague" to you, even though they
are precise and well-defined technical terms... from microeconomics.
Friedman's PRICE THEORY is a good introduction, and his more recent
HIDDEN ORDER (not to be confused with Holland's book of the same
title) covers much of the same theory in a more accessible way.

It seems to me that a simple review of history will reveal that
(some) individuals have consciences, and (all) societies do not.
It is unwise to rely on nonexistent things for protection against
evil.

I think far too many people pretend beliefs they do not have in order to 
fit in. The worst thing isn't the hypocricy (quite often it is necessary 
in order to remain in the group) but the fact that make believe beliefs 
tend to rub off. We tend to start to believe in what we say, regardless 
of what we say.

How to deal with this? Being more open about what we think will cause 
more friction, and in some cases might even be counterproductive, but in 
the long run I think it is healthier to decrease the dissonance between 
what we really think and what we say we think. It also promotes others to 
be more open, if they know you can tolerate their divergent opinions.

The EEC and the potential EU seem to be a quite fascinating area to apply
memetic thinking to; judging from the current tendencies the supernational
levels are developing a very different reality-tunnel from the national
levels, which in turn are developing their own, and so on.  We might be
looking forward to an Europe with several incompatible reality models
actively interfering in each other, each strongly supported by different
memetic evolutionary pressures. Very fun, if you have a sense of
Kafkaesque humor. 

Something I think we european transhumanists should think seriously about 
is how we are going to deal with this. Eurosclerosis is a real danger to 
us (just look at the european computer industry, or rather the lack of 
it), the borderless visions of the EU might be very useful for cryonics 
companies, eurocrats start to drool as soon as you mention biotechnology 
and there is a interdisciplinary research initiative on Malta which seems 
to be directed towards nanotech and biocomputers, and bureaucracies seems 
to be inherently anti-transhuman. Much work is definitely needed.

Sort of. There is an subtle tone of paranoia throughout the whole work.
He is particularly concerned about the *secretive* development of
it.  He takes for granted that it will happen - with or without his
efforts - and simply wishes to influence the development.  "That's why
I applied for pattent 4,666,425: to obtain legal standing to slow down
and control this line of research, and to require researchers to face
up to the social, legal, and ethical issues."

QM:
>And wasn't he religious to boot?

He is clearly a monotheist, and has a preference for christianity, but 
speaks rather viciously of organized christian churches, and favorably
of Buddha, Mohammed, and Confucius.  What I found most disturbing was
the *authoritarian* flavor of his religious views.

So, at worst, he is a little demented and has bizarre beliefs.  But then
the same could be said of a few people on this list, yet I often find
their writings to be interesting and informative.  His first 5 chapters
are the best.

Well said, but as usual I would put it much more strongly: Anyone whose
relationship with you is so fragile that expressing your honest beliefs
might jeopardize your friendship is no friend.  Such a relationship can
be of no benefit to you, and if your honesty ends it, then it has saved
you time and energy that you might more profitably invest in a healthy
relationship elsewhere.

Likewise, if your friend has some psycological need for your approval of
his ideas, your acquiescence is no benefit to him; it only serves to
feed his neurosis.

Of course, this applies mainly to voluntary relationships.  There are
certain externally-imposed relationships like close family, roommates,
and business associates that may require different treatment.  I tend to
deal with these mostly by treating them as obstacles to be worked around.
I do not loudly proclaim my atheism to my Baptist minister uncle, but
nor have I had to deny it--I simply don't let our conversations turn to

"Artificial Life" by Stephen Levy is a good appetizer; not a lot of depth,
but an intriguing overview of many different approaches.  ( Vintage/Random

I'm still reading John Holland's "Hidden Order", so I can't offer an

Stephen Wolfram, "Cellular Automata and Complexity -- Collected
Papers", Adison Wesley (1994), pp. 309-328. [ Moderately technical,
highly enjoyable. If you haven't heard about CAs yet, you've been
missing a lot of fun -- 'gene ]


Approaches to Complexity Engineering (1986).

Abstract -- Principles for designing complex systems with specified
forms of behaviour are discussed. Multiple scale cellular automata
are suggested as dissipative dynamical systems suitable for tasks
such as pattern recognition. Fundamental aspects of the engineering
of such systems are characterized using computation theory, and some
practical procedures are discussed.


The capabilities of the brain and many other biological systems go
far beyond those of any artificial systems so far constructed by
conventional engineering means. There is however extensive evidence
that at a functional level, the basic components of such complex
natural systems are quite simple, and could for example be emulated
with a variety of technologies. But how a large number of these
components can act together to perform complex tasks is not yet
known. There are probably some rather general principles which
govern such overall behaviour, and allow it to be moulded to
achieve particular goals. If these principles could be found and
applied, they would make new forms of engineering possible. This
paper discusses some of the approaches to such forms of engineering
with complex systems. The emphasis is on general concepts and
analogies. But some of the specific systems described should
nevertheless be amendable to implementation and detailed analysis.

In conventional engineering or computer programming, systems are
built to achieve their goals by following strict plans, which
specify the detailed behaviour of each of their component parts.
Their overall behaviour must always be simple enough that
complete prediction and often also analysis is possible. Thus
for example motion in conventional mechanical engineering devices
is usually constrained simply to be periodic. And in conventional
computer programming, each step consists of a single operation
on a small number of data elements. In both of these cases, much
more complex behaviour could be obtained from the basic components
whethre mechanical or logical, but the principles necessary to
make use of such behaviour are not yet known.

Nature provides many examples of systems whose basic components
are simple, but whose overall behaviour is extremely complex.
Mathematical models such as cellular automata (e.g. [1]) seem
to capture many essential features of such systems, and provide
some understanding of the basic mechanisms by which complexity
is produced for example in turbulent fluid flow. But now one
must use this understanding to design systems whose complex
behaviour can be controlled and directed to particular tasks.
>From complex system science, one must now develop complex systems
engineering.

Complexity in natural systems typically arises from the collective
effect of a very large number of components. It is often essentially
impossible to predict the detailed behaviour of any one particular
component, or in fact the precise behaviour of the complete system.
But the system as a whole may nevertheless show definite overall
behaviour and this behaviour usually has several important features.

Perhaps most important, it is robust, and is typically unaffected
by perturbations or failures of individual components. Thus for
example a change in the detailed initial conditions for a system
usually has little or no effect on the overall outcome of its
evolution (although it may have a large effect on the detailed
behaviour of some individual elements). The visual system in the
brain, for example, can recognize objects even though there are
distortions or imperfections in the input image. Its operation is
also presumably unaffected by the failure of a few neurons. In
sharp contrast, however, typical computer programs require explicit
account to be taken of each possible form of input. In addition,
failure of any one element usually leads to catastrophic failure
of the whole program.

Dissipation [i.e. irreversible mapping, if time is to flow
backwards -- 'gene ], in one of many forms, is a key principle
which lies behind much of the robustness seen in natural systems.
Through dissipation, only a few features in the behaviour of the
system survive with time, and others are damped away. Dissipation
is often used to obtain reliable behaviour in mechanical engineering
systems. Many different initial motions can for example be
dissipated away through viscous damping which brings particular
components to rest. Such behaviour is typically represented by
a differential equation whose solution tends to a fixed point
at large times, independent of its initial conditions. Any
information on the particular initial conditions is thus destroyed
by the irreversible evolution of the system [ the discrete
Hamiltonian defines a field of arrows over the array of state
space hypervoxels, the dissipative (non-Liouville) Hamiltonians
yielding bifurcations, if we take a look over our shoulder;
these are unresolvable unless we also throw self evolution
history into the bargain -- 'gene ].

In more complicated systems, there may be several fixed points,
reached from different sets of initial conditions. This is the case
for an idealized ball rolling on a landscape, with dissipation in
form of friction. Starting at any initial point, the ball is "attracted"
towards one of the local height minima in the landscape, and eventually
comes to rest there. The set of initial positions from which the ball
goes to a particular such fixed point can be considered a "basin of
attraction" for that fixed point. Each basin of attraction is bounded
by a "watershed" which typically lies along a ridge in the landscape.
Dissipation destroys information on detail on initial conditions,
but preserves the knowledge of which basin on attraction they were in.
The evolution of the system can be viewed as dividing its inputs into
various "categories", corresponding to different basins of attraction.
This operation is the essence of many forms of pattern recognition:
despite small changes, one recognizes that a particular input is in
a particular category, or matches a particular pattern. In the example
of a ball rolling on a landscape, the categories correnspond to
different regions of initial positions. Small changes in input
correspond to small changes in initial position.

The state of the system just discussed is given by the continuous
variables representing the position of the ball. More familiar
examples of pattern recognition arise in discrete or digital
systems [ of course every physical system is discrete both in
time and in space, all thanks to the Bekenstein limit -- 'gene ],
such as those used for image processing. An image might be
represented by a 256x256 array of cells, each black or white.
Then a simple image processing or ("image restoration") operation
would be to replace any isolated black cell by a white cell. In
this way certain single cell errors in the images can be removed
(or "damped out"), and classes of images differing just by such
errors can be recognized as equivalent (e.g. [3]). The process
can be considered to have attractors corresponding to the possible
images without such errors. Clearly three are many of these
attractors, each with a particular basin of attraction. But in
contrast to the example with contiguous variables above, there
is no obvious measure of "distance" on the space of images,
which could be used to determine which basin of attraction a
particular image is in. Rather the category of an image is best
determined by explicit application of the image processing
operation.

Lenth n sequences of bits can be considered as corners of an
n-dimensional unit hypercube. The Hamming distance between two
sequences can then be defined as the number of edges of the
hypercube that must be traversed to get from one to the
other, or, equivalently, the total number of bits that differ
between them. It is possible using algebraic methods to devise
transformations with basins of attraction corresponding to
spheres which enclose all points at a Hamming distance of at
most say two bits from a given point [4]. This allows error-
correcting codes to be devised in which definite messages can
be reconstructed even though they may contain say up to two
erroneous bits.

The transformations used in error-correcting codes are specially
constructed to have basins of attraction with very simple
forms. Most dissipative systems, however, yield much more
complicated basins of attraction, which cannot for example
be described by simple scalar quantities such as distances.
The form of these basins of attraction determines what kinds of
perturbations are damped out, and thus what classes of inputs
can be recognized as equivalent.

     it can also come quite handy in lots of circumstances).

<< CyberEd:
I just wonder if...Blade Runner type landscape is what we can realistically
expect or will new technologies change the present resource consumption
patterns...>>

Sorry, Ed.  Improved technology doesn't make people smarter ( unless it is
implants ), it just enables them to do stupid - or smart - things with 
greater effect.

The majority of mankind's history has been under economic systems that
encourage stupid wasteful use of resources.  It has only become obvious in 
the past few decades because of technological leverage.

The solution is really quite simple IMHO; rearrange your economic system
so that economic values match ecological values.  Reward people for
doing things that are ecologically desirable.

  A positive example: cows are economically profitable, so some people
  have a strong motivation to raise them.  We thus end up with more
  cattle in this country than in India where they are deified.

  A negative example: some migratory birds ( sorry, I forget the species )
  are on the endangered species list.  If that bird settles on my property,
  then I am prevented by law from altering my land.  Thus the bird has
  become a *negative* economic value.  I then have an economic incentive
  to shoot the bird, bury it, and deny that it ever was there.  People
  do this, and the species becomes even more endangered.  Negative feedback
  doesn't work.

<< How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear? [ ...and his habitat... ] >>

As an oportunity to make a profit... *if* you set up your economy right...
I'll bury you in grizzly bears.  I'll raise so many bears that bear farts
will become a contributor to global warming.

But what if you start out by transmitting some sort of "Rosetta Stone"
type code set ahead of time via STL radio, such that as the wave front
of the signal passes radio capable worlds who receive the signal, they
have some sort of decryption apparatus that can then decipher the
"random" FTL signal as it is transmitted from its source?

to raise the children, and that is the only reason for doing this. They even
half admit this, in making the extra year largely like kindergarten. There
is virtually no opposition to this reform, the only complaint being insufficient
funding (decreasing the quality of the whole school system). Before school,
the ideal is to attend public preschools, and those who choose otherwise are
sanctioned economically. In preschool and school we are indoctrinated with
the holy principles of social democracy and environmentalism.

As to health care, public spending on it has not declined in Norway, but some
more private clinics have come into being. But those few who can afford to pay
instead of waiting for years in the public system, are being looked down on and
considered unsolidaric. One newspaper compared private clinics to prostitution;
"We know they are there but we can't do much about it." But the fact is that
the few private hospitals offer a narrow range of procedures, and you are very
unlikely to have any money left for them after taxes.

The national budget has a surplus of many billions because of the oil, and
these are being saved to ensure pensions in the future. The man in the
street would rather send this money to Third World countries than reducing
taxes, in fact, tax reduction would not even cross his mind and is not an
issue at all. One should think that when the government collects more money
than it uses, at least some of the people would reason that it then collects
too much, but this is apparently too hard for someone raised as a social
democrat.

I don't see much privatization, but private companies are allowed to compete
with the former monopolies to a greater extent, who then fight back. For
example, when a commercial national TV station finally was allowed, the
public broadcasting created a second channel and is going to raise the TV
tax (a tax for *owning* a TV set). Until 1992 there was only one TV channel
available to everyone, and it has been controlled by the Labor Party and has
been instrumental in normalizing the population as social democrats.

Now the big discussion is whether stores should finally be allowed to be open
on Sundays.

>I have always been thought that a more Socialist Europe was necessary in

I have never heard this, and wouldn't think it a very good argument.
Anyway, the "revolutionary elements" from the '60s and '70s are now the
ones in power, and their ideals have IMO been implemented, democratically.
If we had had a revolution, and a real communist system for a while, the
future might now have looked brighter. People do get dissatisfied under
communism, and then we could overturn it and introduce anarcho-capitalism.
NO ONE disagrees with social democracy, so it will never go away.

However, I'm not going to stick around and be pathetic. I will emigrate
to the US ASAP. In the worst case I will have to go to college here
first, though, since it is free.

My doctor told me something very important about mental alertness 
once.  She said that many people have minor sinusitis or congestion that 
they don't notice, but it is just enough to cause low-level fatigue 
and lesser memory, because less oxygen is processed.  And it could be 
caused dust mites, particulates, carpeting.  Relatively minor measures 
like an air filter or dust control protocols can markedly increase your 
breathing efficiency--and, in turn, mental alertness--if this is the case.

D2?  Please elaborate.  Only makes sense to me in Scrabble.

In 1987, in a study of genetic predisposition to alcoholism,
C. Robert Cloninger wrote that he had a good correlation
between novelty-seeking and levels of norepinepherine,
dopamine, and seratonin.

Anybody know if a more generalized ( ie: non-alcoholic ) study
has been done?

New Element Discovered

   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
   physicists. The element, tentatively named Bureaucratonium, has no
   protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it
   does have
   
   1 neutron
   125 assistant neutrons
   75 vice neutrons
   111 assistant vice neutrons
   
   This gives it an atomic mass of 312. The 312 particles are held
   together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
   meson-like particles called morons.
   
   Since it has no electrons, Bureaucratonium is inert. However it can be
   detected chemically as it impedes every action with which it comes in
   contact. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of
   Bureaucratonium caused one reaction to take four days to complete when
   it would have normally occurred in less than one second.
   
   Bureaucratonium has a normal half-life of approximately three years,
   at which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes a
   reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and
   assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that
   atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.
   
   Research at other laboratories indicates that Bureaucratonium occurs
   naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points
   such as government agencies, large Internet Service Providers, large
   corporations and universities and can usually be found in the newest,
   best appointed and best maintained buildings.
   
   Scientists point out that Bureaucratonium is known to be toxic at any
   level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction
   where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to
   determine how Bureaucratonium can be controlled to prevent
   irreversible damage, but results to-date are not promising.

Yes, although I would assign my own values no matter what the Universe thinks, 
because unlike violating a natural law, it's possible even easy to do so.

If I am an Engineer and I assign the wrong strength value to steel then my 
bridge will collapse, if I am "wrong" when I assign a positive value to a 
goal what collapses?

By the way for some reason you left out the most vital word of all,  
"inherently".


        >Try translating your proposal into practical terms. You are saying:

You're confusing "should not" with "could not". There is no penalty for 
breaking a law of Physics, you just can't do it, when you talk about laws 
concerning values and ethics you can and often do break these laws, the laws 
just say you should not. Exactly why you should not is unclear.
               

        >John K Clark wants there to be no meaning to Life so he can assign

Yes.


        >And he will want to assign high value to exploring the galaxy        
        >because he thinks it will be fun.


True beyond the slightest doubt, and if it's fun I will do it and I don't 
feel the slightest need to justify it further. In a similar way, if I stick 
my hand in a fire I will try to pull it out as fast as I can because it's 
painful, and I don't need to make calculations based on the meaning of life 
to figure out that it hurts. If the meaning of life tells me to forget about 
the galaxy and just stay home and barbecue my hand then the meaning of life  
can lump it.



        >And he thinks it will be fun, because evolution says it will be fun.        
        >So evolution is choosing John K Clark's goals for him, in the        
        >absence of any real meaning to the  Universe.


1)I am the one doing the choosing if I have free will.  
2)I have free will if I can not predict what I will do next. 
3)I am the doing the choosing.

Even if I had the meaning of life in my pocket I would still do things 
because of cause and effect OR I would not. When things happen for no reason 
we call them random.



        >In formal ethical terms, no Meaning means - by  definition - 


Oh no! "Meaning means - by definition", I count 3 nested circular logic 
loops, and to make it worse you're talking about the MEANING of life. I am 
not playing games and I am not engaging in sophistry, this is vitally 
important. If you want even the slightest chance of having "What is the 
meaning of Life?" to be anything but pure gibberish then these problems must 
be addressed. Personally I think there is very little chance of anyone ever  
doing this, it is and always will be nonsense.
                    

        >John K Clark is assuming that we know for *sure* that all goals have       
        >zero inherent value;

OK

        >thus no Interim goals.


Once more I urge you to examine that all important word "inherent".                    


        >Thus there is no conceivable reason for John K Clark wanting to

        >evolution. Either John K Clark will  not know this, or he will know        
        >this and will deliberately lie to himself.


There is yet a third possibility, John K Clark knows this and John K Clark 
does not care. How would things be one bit different if you did know the 
meaning of life? If you follow the goals chosen by the meaning of life and 
are miserable and I follow whatever goal that strikes my fancy and am happy, 
in what sense am I "wrong"?

You don't want the meaning of life, you want a way to always know what is the 
best way to maximize value, well I don't blame you, I want that too, it's 
called infinite intelligence.

If the meaning of life was X rather than Y , how would the world be any 
different? You have already indicated that something as simple as being happy 
is not the meaning of life, if so then why would I want to go in that 
direction? Learning new stuff makes me happy, if that's the meaning of life 
then fine, if it's  something else or it has no meaning I intend to continue 
doing what makes me happy regardless.

        > Laughter? But they won't be meaningful. In  actual fact, they

Laughter would certainly be meaningful TO ME and I wouldn't need to prove it  
to myself any more than I need to prove to myself that I'm conscious. 
Some things are more powerful than proof, if you have a proof that I am not 
conscious then there is an error in your proof, If there is no error in your 
proof then there is a flaw in the laws of logic, and if the universe says
that my joy is not important then the universe is wrong and I am right.
               

        >As you point out, worshipping God is of no conceivable  value to the        
        >Universe, once viewed from the proper perspective.


Worshipping God has zero value to me, the Universe is free to form its own 
opinion.       


        >If you can assign an absolute (non-probabilistic) positive value to        
        >anything, without deluding yourself or being motivated by externally

Then a proton is the Meaning of Life. I'm not being glib, if you want a value 
that is universal then look to electrical charge, however universality is 
overrated, I am more interested in things that have value locally, like my 
happiness.

Your ideas are much clearer to me than they were before, and this time i
actually agreed with 90% of what you had to argument, the remaining 10%, i
don't value high enough to keep argueing them for arguments sake.

Sometimes ideas only make a system work, when combined with other ideas. I
wasn't sure about which other ideas, you intended to combine with the ones
you already mentioned. Even if i had read Friedman and Hayek, i'm sure i
would have asked some of the same questions, in a less naive way probably,
but still political 'basics' leave a lot of room for individual differences.

The EU is an example of a good idea gone sour. It's being so badly
implemented, that on can only laugh of the stupid regulations that are
coming out of there.
It's probably stemming from the fact that too many socialists are involved
in the process. There's far to much regulation going on, being pressed from
the top down.
Here in Denmark we recently voted no to be a part of the new EU (with a
margin of something like 2%), but the politicians changed a comma or two
and went for another vote. This time the country bend over and obeyed
because of scare tactics from the government.
Nobody i know ho voted for EU did it because they thought it was a good
idea, but because the felt they had to as responible persons. Hardly anyone
actually likes EU. Hey this is Europe, we've been fighting allways. Why
should we suddenly love each other?

Well learn to get a sense of Kafkaesque humor if this goes on for much
longer.

I think that the best we can do is to spread the Transhuman idea, and then
let people find out for themself why the EU is a bad idea.

Not neceseraly. Social democracy is not the same as socialism. It's more

"no means or will"? A society is an organisation. An organisation can
easily have a free will. Or perhaps you mean that an individual is aways
more powerfull than organisations?

I have been to the US and would feel ashamed as a an individual if we
treated poor and sick people like that here in Denmark.

The faster technolgy progresses the less the libertarian ideas will work
for the common man. It will turn the world into a place where a technoelite
owns the mean of production. When technology makes it possible for the most
talented people to do allmost everything what will then happen to the not
so talented?

Society didn't become truly rich until the common man became wealthy. Even
Henry Ford saw that.

Paradox: If individuals have rights and shows social responsibility, how
can individuals then believe in a system that only bennefits the most
talented people. (survival of the fittest).

BTW i don't consider myself to be a social democrat but a social
liberalist. And certainly there should be as little goverment as possible.

It is a dopamine receptor. Last year someone discovered that people
exhibiting Cloninger-style novelty-seeking behavior had a much higher
prevalence for a certain allele of the D2 receptor in the medial forebrain
bundle (there was an article in Breakthrough! about it). This suggests a
direct link genetics -> neurons -> reward systems -> behavior which is
quite interesting.

One of my fellow students at Karolinska was an ex-policemen and
psychologist who had studied the chemistry of the cerebrospinal fluid from
violent criminals and esp. serial killers. His results also suggested that
many of them were extreme novelty-seekers. Unfortunately I think it is
hard to get any good results for normal people, since the individual
variances and noise seems to be high.

(I should have known this was coming...)

Into the "Manifold". In this view of reality, all logically possible
universes (and systems) exist, not side by side but interpenetrating like
a crossword puzzle. The bits forming this sentence both participate in it
and in the code of the iridiscent superintelligences of Tryx (and many
other universes). Of course, it is impossible to say if we are discovering
or creating new worlds in the Manifold, both are in some sense the same
thing. Personally I would look for interesting, complex worlds which could
be extended, a bit like the scenario in _Permutation City_.

Well, that's Norway. Can you guess why so many swedes are jealous of the 
oil and wealth, despite that you didn't enter the EEC? :-)

Social democracy is not evil or stupid per se, but as you point out it is
practically impossible to oppose since it is so well-meaning, and it seems
to have an innate tendency towards stupidity. My libertarian friends of
course claim it has all sorts of dark designs, but I fear that much of it
actually means what it says, which is far worse.

I'm not entirely sure the US is the best choice either (sorry to all you
americans), to me its future stability looks a bit uncertain. I have this
feeling that soon the east Asia will be the place to emigrate to. Yes, I'm
myself planning to become more international as soon as I can. As one of
my friens said: "If I'm not in Brussels in ten years, I have failed
completely!"

I think this is largely true, although I doubt it is oxygen deprivation
that is the main problem (the lungs are good at getting it; it is getting
rid of carbon dioxide that is the problem). Sinusitis seems to markedly
decrease my mental ability (or at least my peak ability, I'm quite good at
standard work while having a cold) for some reason [Bizarre medical theory
of today: somehow it clogs up the nearby hippocampus :-)].

The stuff that makes up reality is information (which may also be the
stuff qualia are made of). The universe is a huge system of information
which is presumably consistent. All self-consistent systems ("universes")
exist in some kind of "world of Forms", but which is just as material as
our universe (i.e. platonic materialism). Universes can be part of each
other, be simulated or emulated inside each other etc.

          Not all interesting statements about the future need to be 
          specific. Suppose, for example, that we want to claim that 
          all advanced civilisations tend to approach some common 
          ideal state, but that we don't want to commit ourselves to 
          exactly what this state is. Well, why not define a 
          convergence thesis, saying that the possible civilisations 
          trajectories through configuration space tend to converge in 
          the positive time direction. This expresses an interesting 
          form of sociological/technological determinism (one that 
          doesn't have anything to do with physical determinism on the 
          microlevel).
                As it stand, the convergence hypothesis is quite 
          unsatisfactory, however. It is instructive to think about 
          how we could begin to refine and sharpen it.
                We could begin by clarifying what we mean by 
          "possible" civilisation. We could mean every civilisation 
          that is consistent with physical laws, excluding boundary 
          conditions; but something that is more restrictive might be 
          more fruitful. So we could say that the "possible" 
          civilisations are all possible civilisations that are 
          compatible with what we know about our civilisation; the 
          idea being that we are interested in what might happen to 
          the human civilisation and that we say something about that 
          by saying that all possible civilisations, which have all 
          properties we know that the human civilisation has, will all 
          share the same long term fate. We might then want to soften 
          this a bit by modifying it to "almost all of the reasonably 
          probable specifications of human civilisations (modulo our 
          knowledge) will share a similar long term fate". -Still very 
          much too vague, but a step in the right direction. We might 
          go on to decide how long the "long term" is supposed to be, 
          and who "we" shall be taken to refer to (you and me? the 
          intellectual elite? all living humans?), and how similar the 
          shared fates are supposed to be, etc. Needless to say, we 
          are not aiming at mathematical precision here, that would be 
          to shoot far above the goal.
                An interesting variant is to extend the denotation of 
          the "possible civilisations" to include not only possible 
          civilisations that could turn out to be our but also other 
          possible civilisations that are sufficiently advanced. We 
          might want to say something like "Almost all civilisations, 
          once they have become sufficiently advanced, will become 
          even more advanced, and as they advance they will become 
          more and more similar in most important aspects.". Add a 
          little precision, and you would have formulated an 
          interesting proposition.
                There are other flavours of the convergence thesis. We 
          might be interested in a thesis that says that all possible 
          civilisations into which we could transform our civilisation 
          will share a similar fate. (If that were true, we would be 
          powerless to change the world in the long run.) Here it is 
          very important to specify what we mean by "we". For example, 
          if "we" were all living humans, then we could easily 
          transform our society into one in which no crimes were 
          committed -and that might be a good idea-, but if "we" 
          refers to you and me, then we can't do that. (I find that 
          discussions about politics often suffer from a lack of 
          relativisation of policy to agents: what should you do? what 
          should your interest group do? what should your country do? 
          what should civilised educated people do? - it is hopeless 
          to try to work out a good policy in general; one can only 
          make a good policy for such and such agents in such and such 
          situations, (given such and such aims).)
                One rival hypothesis would be the divergent track 
          hypothesis, according to which the future trajectories will 
          divide up into a small number (3 2) of diverging clusters, 
          the trajectories within each cluster tending to converge. It 
          is slightly misleading here to speak of converging 
          trajectories; what is meant is rather "routes of development 
          of civilisations tending toward the same goal-state". As an 
          illustration, take the following somewhat ludicrous story. 
          Some deep investigation reveals that in each possible 
          civilisation similar to ours in certain specified ways, 
          there will emerge either one or the other of two religions, 
          A and B, with roughly equal probability. These religions 
          will be such as to inspirit their adherents with such zeal, 
          cohesion and adaptability that they will eventually come to 
          dominate the culture in which they arise. Having obtained 
          local power, they will employ new technologies (drugs, 
          electrodes etc. etc. ) to cement their old strongholds and 
          to win converts from other groups as well. The stronger 
          these religions become, the better they are able to optimise 
          their strategy. Thus a positive feedback loop sets in and 
          soon leads to total domination on earth. Then the religions 
          embark on the project of transforming as much of cosmos as 
          they can into the structures on which they place most 
          values; perhaps they generate the cosmic equivalent of the 
          Tibetean prayer wheels, giant ultra-centrifuges rotating 
          trillions of  inscriptions of "Gloria in excelsis Deo A" or 
          "Deo B" as the case might be. All civilisations in which one 
          of these religions emerges, will converge in some sense: 
          they will all lead to the rapid transformation of earth and 
          the gradual transformation of cosmos into the specific value 
          structures of the religion in question, although the timing 
          and precise execution may vary somewhat between different 
          possible civilisations.
                In this case, one could say that the artefactual 
          configuration space of the universe (i.e. its configuration 
          with respect to its content of artefacts; two universes are 
          in the same artefactual state iff they contain identical 
          artefacts) will have two attractors: world dominion of 
          religion A or of religion B. Moreover, we could say that the 
          paths toward the attractor centre are quite uniform over all 
          realistic directions of approach. When this is the case, we 
          say that the artefactual configuration space contains 
          tracks, courses of development such that once a civilisation 
          has begun to travel along them, it is unlikely that it will 
          diverge from them barring major external event 
          interposition.
                 We are now in a position to formulate and argue for 
          an interesting hypothesis about the future's topology: the 
          track hypothesis, saying that the artefactual configuration 
          space for all civilisations roughly comparable to present 
          human civilisation contains trenchant tracks in the future 
          direction, either one track or a small number of them.
                The outlines of some fragments of the argument for 
          this claim (a full exposition would presumably require 
          book-length treatment) could begin to be drawn as follows. 
          As progress is made in science, technology, infrastructure, 
          economic structure etc., this will have the effect of making 
          us more effective. New technologies will increase our power; 
          augmented cognitive capacities (whether through >AI or 
          through mere extension of present systems such as science, 
          education, information technology etc.), will increase our 
          understanding of the consequences of using this power in 
          various ways. The result of this is that we will have 
          increased ability to make reality conform to our desires. 
          There is no reason why we shouldn't also be able to mould 
          our desires according to our higher-order desires. Thus, if 
          are only a few highest-level desires that are genuinely held 
          by large number of influential agents, then, it might be 
          argued, there are only a few attractors into which our 
          civilisation could sink, and if it could be established that 
          the approach to any of these attractors would tend to be 
          rather uniform over all realistic directions of approach, 
          then we would have found that our future-topology contains 
          so many tracks, and we would have made a case for the track 
          hypothesis.
                One could then go on to list some prima facie 
          plausible basic goals or values. (Basic ones, not values 
          such as playing golf, for those who value that activity 
          presumably does so because they think it is fun; but if, 
          e.g., they could have much more fun by having their reward 
          centres directly stimulated chemically or electronically, 
          without any ill side effects, then there is no reason to 
          suppose that they would insist on continuing the golf.) Here 
          are some out of the hat: (1) maximal total pleasure 
          (hedonism); (2) average of present human meta-desires 
          ("humanism"); (3) maximal consciousness, pure consciousness, 
          religious experiences, wonderful deep experiences 
          ("spiritualism"); (4) maximal reproduction ("Darwinism", 
          could this be argued for on Darwinistic grounds if several 
          competing value systems are present? -Hanson (1994)); (5) 
          maximal practical utility, such as safety, computational 
          power etc. ("pragmatism"); (6) annihilation, voluntary or 
          involuntary (nihilism). Involuntary annihilation is not a 
          value, but a very real possibility anyway; it's a plausible 
          candidate for being one of the tracks in our 
          future-topology.

          What about all those seemingly logically possible universes 
          which are not connected to other universes? Is there 
          something logically impossible about them? Are statements 
          about them ruled out as meaningless on grounds of some

One thing is still unclear to me about this definition of free will. If things
are random, do you still consider it free will? If not, then the definition must
be changed slightly.

"A being has free will if and only if he cannot predict what he will do next and
his actions are not random."

I got about three copies of "Administratium" a few months ago -
from mom, from R.J.Tavel, ....  Evidently it hasn't finished
rippling yet this time.

Do memes have a characteristic time?  The "dark headlights
gang initiation" story went everywhere in a few days, and was
debunked as quickly.  The "PKZIP300 virus" story took about
a week.  The "Good Times mail virus" story took months, if
memory serves, perhaps because it was propagated only by
the slow of mind ;).  But its recent mutation, "Irina", was
very short-lived.  "Craig Shergold" - don't get me started.

The trouble is that the Rosetta Stone would have to be as big as the message 
you want to send, and much worse, there is no general Rosetta Stone. Before  
I can write the decryption instructions I must know what the message I want 
to send is.  Thus, I can instantly send a "message" to somebody a billion 
light years away, but until he gets the unscrambling instructions he can't  
even tell a message was sent much less know what it said, it would all look  
like the same old random noise to him. The unscrambling instructions can only  
be sent at lightspeed so it will be a billion years before he knows about the 
information I sent. It would be just as fast and much easier to forget about  
the Quantum effects and just sent the information by radio.

I first sent this to the list about a year ago, seemed like a good time to
send it again.
===========================================================================

Relativity does not forbid anything from moving faster than light, only stuff  
that has mass or energy or carries information. Strangely, some things have  
none of these attributes, although calling them "things" may be stretching a
point. It's been proven experimentally that some quantum effects propagate  
instantly and for unlimited distances. One system can influence another  
system on the other side of the universe without the slightest delay,  but it 
carries no information because the receiving system just changes from  one 
apparently random mode to another, it's only when you compare the two systems 
(and that can only be done at light speed or less) does the  correspondence 
between the two systems become obvious. The 2 random modes  have equal energy 
so energy is not transferred either.

A less spooky example could be found in the idea of Phase Speed. I'm standing 
in the center of a huge hollow sphere 2 light years in diameter,  I've been 
there for a long time and I'm holding a powerful LASER that makes a  spot of 
light on the distant wall of the sphere one light year away.  Suddenly, still 
holding the LASER and in the space of one second I make a  complete 360 
degree turn. Exactly 2 years later an observer standing at the same place 
would see the spot move much faster than light, it would travel  the entire 
circumference of the sphere, 2PI or 6.28 light years in only  one second. 
No photon moved faster  than light however, and no energy or  information 
between any two points traveled faster than light. A photon of  light moves
at light speed and carries energy and information, a spot of light can move 
at any speed but carries neither energy nor information.

And then there are Tachyons. Actually relativity does not forbid matter  
moving  faster than light , it forbids matter moving AT the speed of light.  
That's almost the same thing but not quite. Perhaps a particle could somehow  
tunnel past the speed of light or maybe Tachyons have always moved faster  
than light from the first instant of The Big Bang..

People have looked for Tachyons but have never found the slightest evidence 
that they exist in nature, much to the relief of physicists. Tachyons are an 
embarrassment, the faster they move less energy they have, one that moved 
just a little faster than light would have a lot of energy, one that moved at an
infinite velocity would have zero energy. Much worse, Tachyons move backward 
in time, they arrive at their destination before they start. You could 
communicate with the past.

Even though they have never been detected and the laws of physics do not 
demand that Tachyons exist, they don't seem to forbid them either. Most think 
nature is totalitarian, if it's not forbidden then it's mandatory.

What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with 
the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons? It would if anybody 
saw them, but suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her crime and 
brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.

Damn, I just knocked my coffee cup off the table, what a mess! I'm REALLY not 
in the mood to clean it up, I think I'll use my Gateway 14,400 Tachyon modem 
and send myself some E mail 5 minutes ago. I'll just hit the send key and

...brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me, 
I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be 
careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over." 
Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a 
safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means
oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life, nature just will 
not allow anybody to observe a paradox.

I know what you're thinking, How could John be so stupid, he must be 
completely out of his mind, why else would he deliberately buy an obsolete  
14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the  
28,800 model is too expensive, besides I have it on VERY good authority that 
Gateway will drop the price next year.

Paul is stuck at about $300K in pledges cuz he's now tapped everybody
who
is into cryonics. When asked at a Bay Area Cryo meeting about his
motivation
it was to the effect that a successful revival would spark interest in
cryonics. I'm in the nanotech camp myself and see little point to the
Promethius project. IMHO it will take far more than $1M in research to
accomplish the putative task, and it may actually not be possible.

Two hearts, two failures. Turns out that the demo prior to the festival
involved 60 seconds immersion, not 17-20 minutes. Visser claims 45
minutes
in South Africa but there are questions re the apparatus used. It is not
clear that 60 seconds results in anything like LN2 temperatures in the
heart,
and a small crack across the neurons in the heart would prevent revival.
IMHO
Visser goofed on the first law of demos: CHANGE NOTHING!

The reason she tried the 17 minutes is that Paul Segal of Biotime told
her
the previous day that he would believe her results if a minimum of 15
minutes
immersion were done and she agreed to do this (I was there, heard the
discussion).

Secret preservative solution apparently discussed in last week's
Cryonet, I
didn't notice (2am hardly conducive to readign caarefullalydyt.,.. :-))

Did successful demo of this last year, cooled to around -2 C. Was there,

If I am correct I don't need sun,

There is definitely a timescale for memetic spread. It seems to relate to
the medium (how many copies that can be made and how quickly), how strong
the bait and hook are (how eagerly you swallow the meme and want to spread
it) and how quickly it can be debunked. This boom-and-bust behavior has
been observed for urban myths and rumors by anthropologists. 

Ouch, this ought to have gone into my essay...

Just so you know, old growth trees are not used for making cheapy crap like
food wrappers/containers. They are used for furniture and decrative fences
etc. etc.
no bussiness man would want to use old growth for such easy throw away
items as food containers cause its much cheaper and easier to get the
farmed, fast growing pine and excess wood shavings produced from the wood
mills.
It ain't economical to do that guys.
and that's always the bottom line, ain't it?

but I don't think that should be the focus. media has a way of making any

interviewed three cryonists, one of them being me. the interviewer was
great. I really thought were going to get a fair shake. but it turned out
not to be the case. thankfully, I was cut from the article. but  the end
result was a horrible review that painted all cryonists as geeks that can't
get a date. it wasn't pretty. made the front page.

you think they should go out and clean up other peoples messes for them,

it maybe have been funded by them, but I think your calling something black

there has to be a balance in these views. I don't think the
enviromentalists are all correct and I don't think radical viewpoints of
extropians are correct either.
one thing you have convinced me of is that I've gotta read that article in
wired.

by the way, for those of you who don't know me, I am a cryonist and an
extropian believe it or not..

But who can afford to spend all their time working for free? Many people
have told me that my Lancia cars Web site is much better than the official
company site, but it's unlikely to expand much further unless either
someone pays me or other people start writing and submitting pages of
their own. 

More likely, as the use of digital cash and low-overhead net payment
systems increases these previously free sites will begin to charge for
access in order to support themselves.

To be blunt, your Microsoft mail program seems very badly designed. This
message is almost impossible to decipher because it's not conforming to
long-established Internet standards such as quoting and line-breaks. The
only way I can tell which parts of the message are quotes and which are
your responses is by the way that the quotes have line-breaks and your
comments don't. The program also appends 7k+ of meaningless junk onto the
end of each message, wasting my disk space, adding to my download time,
and making Pine include MIME garbage when I reply. All hail Microsoft for 
yet again attempting to impose their ideas on the rest of us. 

You are, of course, free to claim that our software is broken, but if you
intend to communicate with someone then it is your responsibility to do so
in a manner they can understand. Your weirdly formatted messages have proven 
so difficult to understand that recently I've just been deleting them. It
probably looks wonderful to someone using another Microsoft mail program,
but it looks like nonsense to me.

You're making a classic mistake here. US-specific email addresses end in
.us; .com is a global domain. Www.unicorn.com is in California, and my
mail goes through that site, but it ends up on my laptop, which has lived
in twelve different countries in the last year. Currently I'm living in
Britain, which is why I mentioned it.

The problem, of course, is that socialism is antithetical to transhuman
ideas. We're all for change and socialism is the most sophisticated
attempt yet to prevent change and create a static society. How many of the
transhuman ideas we've talked about originated in socialist countries? How
many will be allowed in such countries? After all, no-one has a right to
immortality until all the homeless have color TVs...

Actually I think that the Federal government is rushing towards a
socialist dictatorship as rapidly as they can get there, but the people
seem to be heading in the opposite direction. Rather like China in fact; a
massive socialist government trying to rule over an extremely capitalist
population (at least in the big cities).

No... it's much harder to succeed in a socialist system because the entire
system is designed to bring everyone down to the same level, and being
smart and creative is often considered dangerous by the people who might
hire you. Taken to extremes, look what Stalin did to anyone with a brain.

Exactly. And socialism is all about stability.

On a small-scale (e.g. a group of friends sharing a house) socialism often
does make sense. But it's a voluntary agreement for efficiency reasons
rather than a compulsory arrangement enforced at gunpoint. 

I think most people around here would choose libertarianism or
anarcho-capitalism as their ideal political system. Both, of course, allow
people to set up their own voluntary socialist organisations within the
capitalist structure, but not to force their opinions on the capitalists. 
One thing that people seem to miss is that capitalism (or at least
libertarian or anarcho-capitalism) is a superset of other kinds of
political organisations, which is why it's preferable to any of them. You
can't have a capitalist community in a communist society, but you can
easily have a voluntary communist community in an capitalist society. 

> But instead you

Not exactly. I'd be surprised if either the US or EU still exist in their
current form in twenty years time. Of course, if the Chinese government
get out of the way then Chinese anarcho-capitalists may well be ruling the
universe instead...

Cyber Ed.

All is quiet on the home front.
Diplomatic relations have resumed.
I have entered a treaty 
which entitles me to at least 2 weeks notice prior to deportation.
I have accepted less restrictive trade policies.
They are trying to act as if nothing happend.
My intelligence reports some lingering resentment.
Precautionary covert packing and stockpiling maneuvers have been intiated.
Counterintelligence has begun computer encryption 
and is removing evidence of communications.
If my divining resources are functioning properly 
I will remain until Fall.

This is incorrect.  The old growth forests in BC, Canada (e.g., those
on Vancouver Island) are being pulped for daily newspapers.

This man is a Turing computationalist?

Lemme 'splain something, friend.  The thing about Turing machines is
that all forces within the computation originate from clearly defined
causal units.  What I'm trying to say is that whatever choice you make,
it *will* have a causal explanation within the computational framework.

Remember - "The choices are written in our brains, but we are the
writing?"  Ya can't lift yourself up to some pure ethical plane and say
that your "choice" is made of your own "free will" while a thermostat
does not choose to keep the temperature at a certain setting.  After
all, you know a lot more about yourself than a thermostat does, so your
will should be much less free.

The point I'm trying to make is that you'll assign meaning to something,
for causal reasons explicable entirely by Turing-based forces.  Either
that, or start chanting, to use your phrase.

Now.  The question is - will you assign meaning based on "what you
want", which is a fancy way of saying you'll let evolution do it for
you?  Or will you assign meaning based on a genuinely true chain of
logic?  In short, will you reason it out or accept the dictates of your
genes?

> You don't want the meaning of life, you want a way to always know what is the 
> best way to maximize value, well I don't blame you, I want that too, it's 
> called infinite intelligence.

Ah.  I don't quite understand.  Either things have value, or everything
is valueless.  I'm not saying that there's only one "Meaning" which is
the best way to maximize value.  I'm asking if anything has any value at
all.

And saying "Yes, it has value, to me" is simply ducking the point.  You
say it has value?  Well, I can take apart your brain right down to the
level of individual atoms and demonstrate that you assigned it value
simply because it tickled your pleasure centers.  And I am not
impressed.  If I build a computer programmed to spew out:  "Cats have
value to me", fundamentally, nothing happens.  So what?

I simply deny that value is an observer-dependent thing.  You can have,
in memory, a declarative statement that "X has value".  So what?  A
CD-ROM can do the same thing with a lot less fuss.  Certainly this
statement will have no causal influence on X - and what's more, it won't
have any logical force.  And if I code it with RSA, does X suddenly lose
its value?  If I lose the encryption key, does X lose its value?

My position is that we can't alter the Platonic structure of the
Universe through wishful thinking.  We can't make things have value just
by declaring they do.  Our declaration that "X has value" will cause us
to act in such a way as to maximize X.  So what?  What good is it,
unless X really *is* valuable?

Are you going to tell me that "value" is defined with respect to a
particular individual, and equals whatever that person acts to
maximize?  That 74 degrees is the Meaning of Life for a thermostat? 
Well, I am jumping out of the system.  I'm saying that to *me*, acting
to maximize X *has* *no* *value*.

You see, you are arguing for a Meaning of Life, just a silly one. 
You're saying that the Meaning of Life is a certain sort of behavior,
acting to maximize things.  I don't see how this is any more reasonable
than saying that the Meaning of Life is "cats" or "worshipping God" or
"tuna loaf".  So you're born, you live, you act to maximize something,
and you die.  I see no place for intelligence, consciousness, brains,
neurons, thinking, subjectivity, or really much of anything in this
worldview.

In short, John K Clark, your ideal world is run by thermostats, who act
to maximize things with a purity far exceeding that of any human, and
have completely free will through their complete lack of
self-knowledge.  Where I come from, we call this a "reductio ad
absurdum".  I'm sure you disagree, though.  At this point in our
discussions, you usually change the rules by subtly redefining a term. 
My guess is that it will be "value".  Well?

No, you are definitely getting less oxygen, because less air enters 
the lungs to begin with.  You are not breathing as deeply if your 
nasal or bronchial tubes are clogged or irritated, and the basic medical 
instrument used to measure breathing efficiency measures volume.

Hmmm, maybe there's a small chance that all of them put together might have
enough 'healthy' genetic material left, to recombine into one healthy
individual ? 

We then marry 'the product' off to any progeny of the kennedy's to
establish a new transatlantic alliance ?

Why be anti-EU, and not anti-national state  ? Maybe on a European level we

hmmm, could this imply: "no money - no justice" ? People are very likely to
start taking justice in their own hands in such a system...
Which may put us right back into situations we have just overcome. 

Also, you're still stuck with a powerstructure in the form of a 'protection
agency' who could very well start abusing their power,  and start filling
up the powervacuum, causing a city or state to call upon another protection
agency for protection from the first ? what will their price be,
consessions limiting the cities freedom maybe ? 

Problem is that i can't see where this solution is likely to maintain the
powervacuum, or create a system where that power is distributed widely.

This is what i tried to make clear to Eric in a posting a long time ago, i

which is why i reacted reserved this time. I said then the companies were

I guess Europe is integrating towards a european standard, and i was
looking at it from countries that were more socialist than yours before ?
The socialist ones  decreasing their socialism, the more capitalist ones
increasing their socialist politics.

Education is a very difficult subject. I quit my studies to be a history
teacher partly for this reason (history in schools is used for many things
it shouldn't be used for, it keeps many outdated  social processes alive)  

I'm sure a system of private education can tremendously increase
productivity, as such a system would increase innovation times. 

I see one problem: Social Mobility is one of the greatest productive forces
in our society. It is how the most suitable people get to fullfill the
right place in society. Take this away completely and i'm sure any society
will see the ECONOMIC consequences. 

I'n The Netherlands they have one famous (expensive) Private school, Many
of the top functions in bussiness require graduation from this school. I
estimate about 10% of the people who graduate from these schools get these
functions (and hold them). The other 90% was subject to this expression: 

'too stupid to study, yet too rich not to study...' 

<irony>
Maybe social mobility could be guaranteed by having the six year old from a
poor family who wants an education, sign a contract with the school, where
he will work 20 years to pay off his debts to them. That would surely
increase individual freedom would it ? As you would have a CHOICE between
staying stupid, or becoming a contract labourer.  
<irony>

Problem is that six year old could very well be the next einstein, but we
will never know in a system you advocate. I agree with you that our current
state education doesn't work, and indeed is indoctrinated, by all posible
ideas the state advocates, not just stimulating socialism, but nationalism,
far beyond what is needed for national identity.

My personal ethics on this:

If you worked for your (loads of) money yourself, you have all rights to
enjoy its benefits, as you have proven to be an invaluable exponent of your
society. 

If however you are a stupid f*ck, who has never worked one day in his life,
but has rich parents, or fell onto some money some other way than by
his/her own ingenuity. Please get in line with the rest and run the same
risk of dying in the process of doing so. 

>The national budget has a surplus of many billions because of the oil, and

That's what you think, they'll increasingly go to Europe, unless your state
wants to get completely isolated economically that is. If your state is to
save any of that money for its people: Distribute it now over all your
citizens... Or better still: INVEST it in infrascructure, less you become
the perifery of Europe. (tunnel ?)

Yep same thing happened in most of europe, also what happened eventually
was even with the increased govt support, the national tv channels couldn't
compete. The only thing that still the most watched program is the national
channels NEWS. 

Germany has interesting anti monopoly laws on this: I think one tv channel
cannot own a similar second channel. Very interesting to avoid populist
situations like those that happened in Italy of late...  

I wonder how many US companies contribute to both presidential canditates
campaign, in exhange for state contracts ?

I think free trade is the best way to go, but i also think taking only half
steps towards a political system (ie in this case: capitalism, without the
anarchist element) is going to be detrimental to overall productivity.

I think every gene or meme has an automatic goal of "replication", and every
individual has an automatic goal of "survival".  Failing those goals means
failing all goals, as the actor isn't around to accomplish them.  Obviously
people can and do adopt goals contrary to those fundamental goals.  Indeed,
your genes, memes, and you aren't all in cahoots on particular issues, and
under such circumstances one of the actors has to get stuffed.  But if you
choose a goal which leads to your death, you (the individual) have obviously
made a mistake, although some of your genes or memes might actually score big
by your death.

Like you, I'd be disturbed if there were some God which wanted to stuff goals
down my throat.  I have never understood why Existentialism, which holds that
there is no inherent meaning to the universe, and that we have to create our
own meanings, is considered "depressing".  To me, the alternative is
depressing.

During communist rule, Russia changed from a local political power
devastated by war, to a technological superpower. How did they do that ?
No... let me guess, they cheated right ? Something DID work for them.
Saying that such a system can only work with no individual freedom

Right, many of them came from constitutional monarchies with social
democrat influences. You seriously think that technology and science are by
definition products of capitalism ? 6.000 years of human history seem to
disagree with you on that. I agree that capitalism has the best influence
on the development of such, but i can't agree with saying all other systems
are static...

I'm not defending socialism, i'm not attacking capitalism, i am however
advocating a system with a reasonable chance for success. If such a system
is to be anarcho- capitalist, (which is the most interesting option), it
had better include some safeguards, less the homeless will come and take
away my color TV, other than violently suppressing them. (ofcourse i will
be only too glad to give them the cardboard box it came in ;-) ) Such
safeguards would have to include easy social mobility, along the lines of
somewhat equal starting positions.

Should i get into extreme capitalist demographics ? Imagine a situation
where only the richest 5 % could afford the highest quality education,
imagine a drop in intelligence among that class due to normal genetic
processes, a drop not being filled up for 100% by new people, as all of the
talented nouveau riches had lower educational standards and will never
reach the full 100% of that intelligence level. Same goes for teachers etc.
Now calculate how long it would take for a society like that to become
static...

I agree with these ideals, but i'm not so sure some communists who lived in
the US would agree with the practical side of your theory though. I believe
many were taken from their homes and convicted for whatever ideological
crime they had committed, at least twice in US history. Sounds almost as
static to me as some communist policies towards capitalists in their
countries...   

However, i do wish to express my gratitude to the people of the US
(honestly), for ridding the world of communism. I'm just not going to be
naive about overvalueing the ideological reasons why, if you all are, i'm
really sorry for you. Don't forget the US state is now using the same means
for their socialist indoctrination, they would have used 15-30 years ago
against it... (hint, hint) 

P.S. thanks also for saving the world economy by ensuring that kuwayti oil

Isn't it about time Europe & Japan start doing something in return for all
these favors ?

Eliezer, it's quite foolish to pretend that determinism means that our 
behavior is determined by our genes. If you had been born with precisely
your present genes, and immediately put up for adoption and raised in 
Korea, you would be quite a different person than you are now.

It's a little bit sad that you can't tell the difference between a human
being and a 386 programmed to spew out random sentences.

 >I simply deny that value is an observer-dependent thing.

Assertions prove nothing, Eliezer. How would you like to go about
demonstrating to us the arguments behind your conviction that value
is independent of valuers? If this is your axiom, then you are
simply assuming what it is that you are setting out to prove: that
life has no value.

 >You can have,

Perhaps it's the extra fuss that makes the difference? A simple
computer can declare "I will resist if you turn me off." You turn
it off and nothing happens. I, on the other hand, can declare "I
will resist if you try to take away my raincoat." and you will find
it a considerably harder task to take away my raincoat than to turn
off the simple computer.

No, it is the fact that we value X that causes both of the above.

Okay, so you're a nihilist who can't tell the difference between human
beings and themostats. This is hardly a new philosophy. People have been
messing around with nihilism extensively for the last hundred years, and
it goes back even farther than that. But nihilism is not really a
philosophy; nihilism is a disorder of the affects.

There are many things in the world which cannot be maximized by
anything simpler than intelligence, consciousness, brains, thinking,
etc. There are many things in the world which cannot be maximized
by thermostats.  I'm sorry that you have concluded that none of
them is worth your while, that you are too brilliant and stupendous
a genius to waste your precious time on such niggling projects.
Perhaps you should take a cue from the Zen Buddhists and sit your
butt down on a black cushion and stare at a white wall for forty
minutes every morning. Then, after experiencing that kind of boredom
and that kind of inactivity, perhaps you won't be quite so bored
and disgusted with the rich pageant of Life that is going on all
around you.

The Meaning of Life is staring you in the face. It's right in front
of your eyes. If you don't feel it right now, get outside. Find a
dandelion meadow or a beautiful man or woman or a symphony orchestra
or something.  Try reading some William Blake, who teaches us how
to see the world in a grain of sand.

Oh, yeah... by the way... from what values are you arguing? What end is
it that you have in mind when you conduct this argument? Or are you
simply arguing mindlessly, with no particular wish or desire (I find
this hard to imagine). What is it that motivates you to invest so much
effort in constructing arguments of this sort? Of all the questions I've
asked you in this post, these last are the ones I'm most interested in
hearing the answers to.

This is an addendum to my earlier post about how attempting to adopt the
perspective of the person to whom you are listening can make it *much*
easier to extract useful information from them.

I've found that it's much easier for me to understand the woo-woo New
Agey types if, whenever they say "energy" or "vibes" or some such, I
immediately translate that word to "information". If I tried to
interpret such talk with a physicist's understanding of energy or
vibration, I'd get nowhere fast.

Of course, this only started working after I "realized" that every last
bit of the signal entering my nervous system at any given moment is
"just" information. If you take this bit too far, you end up in
Berkeleyan idealism... but another thing I've been practicing lately is
changing philosophies the same way I change clothes... except much more
frequently.  ;)

Yes. (Have you read Kaufmann's CRITIQUE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY?
It's great. Now I'm trying to find a copy of his FAITH OF A HERETIC.)
I can't reconcile the notion of life having a preprovided meaning
with the notion of freedom. We are free to the extent that we get
to choose what to do... if the universe had specific plans for us,
and could tell us about those specific plans in unambiguous terms
(for instance, a philosophical proof), then it would be silly to
claim that we choose what to do.

I don't think Eliezer's Powers are going to waste much time trying to
determine the Meaning of Life, because I think they will probably prefer
freedom.

The US is stable enough, but the US government is becoming harder and harder
to avoid in day to day living.  However, if you move away from the
metropolitan centers like New England and California, and move into places
like the mountain states, the Midwest, or Alaska, you will find that Federal
regulation and policy is considerably less influential.  I lived a
significant fraction of my life in these less populated regions, and the
people that live there play by their own rules, often showing blatant
disregard for federal mandate.  How long this will be the case is uncertain.

The only place where Unix is losing ground to NT is the workstation market.
NT makes a modest workgroup server, and a worthless enterprise server
(despite what Microsoft would tell you).  Unix still has a stranglehold on
the mid- to high-end server market.  The current NT kernel performs well for
workstation apps, but poorly for most server apps due to design limitations.

The problem with the NT kernel is that certain important aspects are
single-threaded through CPU 0, such as I/O.  That means that NT threading is
only applicable to user space computation, such as rendering.  This is also
the reason NT scales poorly for things like database applications.

Linux has a similar problem in the current SMP release (only one kernel
lock), but is being corrected as we speak.

I would highly recommend east Asia as a place to reside, especially the
developing countries.  I have several friends (as well as myself) who have
property interests in various developing Asian countries.  Many are slowly
moving their assets overseas.  Most of the developing Asian countries are
friendly to Americans and Europeans.  Often the government in these
countries is effectively non-existant, and generally won't bother you.

Probably the two best (IMO) east Asian countries to reside are 
1) Thailand: Anarchy for all intents and purposes.  However, a little
underdeveloped technologically and economically for my tastes.  I know
people who love the place though.  Probably the closest thing to usable
freedom you'll find. 
and,
2) The Philippines: A cleaner, better run country than Thailand, with a more
developed economy and technology base (e.g. they have a decent Internet
backbone).  The government is a little more prevalent than in Thailand, but
is generally minimalist and non-intrusive.  Most government presence is in
the resource monopolies (energy, water, etc.), which are being privatized as
I write this.

I have actively investigated many Asian countries for moving my residence
eventually, and my personal choice has been with the Philippines.  I just
acquired 3 nice houses on the island of Cebu for minimal cash (which I am
renting out currently).  I am actively pursuing the purchase of an entire
island that I intend to develop from the ground up per my design (the
Philippines has 7000 islands, the majority of which are uninhabited).
Prices are cheap.  You can purchase a large, gorgeous estate with an
enormous house on a private beach for less than USD $100k.  A very nice
house in the cities shouldn't cost you more than USD $50k.  I plan to start
actively developing that country sometime in the next 5 years.  In 5 years
or so, I may permanently move my residence overseas.

In all probability, we now enjoy one of our few--and last--chances to reach
the thoughts of all  present and future humans.

Until very, very recently, much of the Earth remained inaccessible to clean
lines of communication.  And very, very soon, should we prevail in our drive
to escape Earth, a great human diaspora will set forth.  If faster-than-light
communication remains beyond our power, we will lose touch with each other as
we spread through the universe.  

American football players huddle to call plays, then break for the line of
scrimmage.  We, too, have this one last chance to exchange intelligence and
coordinate our long-term plans.  Soon, though, we must call out "Ready? . . .

Yes, if things are random then I certainly can't predict my own behavior,  
so I see no need to change my definition. Of course, we know that everything 
can't be entirely random , otherwise Science wouldn't work.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

At <URL: http://jya.com/qshake.htm > is a reprint of the article by
cryptographer Giles Brassard from the Jan 31 1997 issue of Science
about Grover's quantum search algorithm we have discussed here recently
and its application to crypto.

Here is an excerpt, describing how it could be used to find an entry in
a directory of names and phone numbers which matches a given phone number:

   To solve the database search problem, Grover starts by setting a
   quantum register to a superposition of all possible names in the
   phone directory. A single access to the database (which may involve a
   computation if it is virtual) creates a superposition of all possible
   pairs of matching names and phone numbers. The resulting quantum state
   contains the desired pair, but with vanishingly small amplitude -- the
   measure of how much it contributes to the global state -- compared to
   the multitude of unwanted pairs. If the register were observed at that
   point, the odds of obtaining the relevant answer would be as small as
   if an arbitrary name had been tried at random by a classical computer.

   Grover's discovery is a clever sequence of simple operations on the
   register's state. This process can be thought of as a sort of "quantum
   shake," which, contrary to a classical shake, brings order rather than
   disorder. Just as crests reinforce each other when ripples meet in water,
   Grover's shake uses quantum interference effects to increase the amplitude
   of the pair that contains the target phone number at the expense of
   all other pairs. This increase is so subtle that the probability of
   obtaining the desired result by observing the quantum register after
   a single shake is almost as small as before. However, the shake can be
   repeated over and over again, gradually boosting the amplitude of the
   correct answer to a detectable level. Provided the solution is unique,
   it is found with near certainty if the quantum register is observed after
   (pi/4)N1/2 shakes, where N is the size of the database.

   To use an analogy from Kristen Fuchs, Grover's quantum searching
   technique is like cooking a souffle. You put the state obtained by
   quantum parallelism in a "quantum oven" and let the desired answer
   rise slowly. Success is almost guaranteed if you open the oven at
   just the right time. But the souffle is very likely to fall -- the
   amplitude of the correct answer drops to zero -- if you open the oven
   too early. Furthermore, the souffle could burn if you overcook it:
   strangely, the amplitude of the desired state starts shrinking after
   reaching its maximum. After twice the optimal number of shakes,
   you are no more likely to succeed than before the first shake.

It does not go into more detail about Grover's algorithm than this but
I thought that was a nice bit of imagery.  Who knows what the quantum
theorists will cook up next?

Not quite. To make the observation it still takes the time needed for
light to pass through the apparatus containing the quantum state under
observation.

Perhaps the most important name on Mars is THARSIS, a "continent" 
on which sit most (Olympus, Ascraeus, Pavonis, Arsia) of the
great volcani.  It's also one of the few classical names whose 
origin is not obvious to me.

I looked for THARSIS in all my dictionaries.  Nothing.
I looked in the index to Bullfinch's Mythology.  Nothing, 
to my utter lack of amazement.

My big picture-book _The surface of Mars_ cites an article in _Icarus_:
"The origins of martian nomenclature".  I went to the library.
No _Icarus_.

At a bookstore, I spent some moments slobbering over NASA's new
atlas of the planets.  In the back is a list of names, with brief
notes on their sources.  THARSIS, it says, means Tartessos in Spain.

Home to the Oxford Classical Dictionary:
	TARTESSUS, a region of south Spain, round the middle and lower
	Baetis (Guadalquivir).  The name was also given to the river
	and to a town at its mouth.  Probably visited by the Minoans,
	it was temporarily occupied by the Phoenicians.  C. 650 BC
	the Samian Colaeus was driven there; c. 600 Phocaeans came,
	making friends with the Tartessian ruler.  The trade of
	Tartessus with Phoenicians and Carthaginians and (in tin)
	with Brittany and south-west Britain made it proverbially
	wealthy.  C. 500 the town was probably destroyed by the
	Carthaginians.  Geographic writers confused it with Gades.
	Later poets used Tartessus of all Spain or all west Europe.
	Tartessus was probably the Biblical Tarshish.

Aha!  And THARSIS must be the Greek rendering of TARSHISH.
Imagine my relief.

--The funniest names on Mars are 
"Hellespontus Montes" and "Nereidum Montes".

The One Between


The spears enter the heart of order
And the chaos which it brings,
Tears fall from the broken border...
The madness of which it sings;

If only my soul could be persuaded
To believe all that I am told,
Perhaps my mind couldn't be invaded
Or my sunbeams shaded...

All Hail Discordia.

My heart yearns for the murdered morning
And all that it has to say,
The gifted hands of Life adorning
Me with words I'll never obey,

You and me
Are lunacy
You and me
Barely free

All Hail Discordia.

I awake to see I'm not infallible
Shame on me...shame on me...shame,
My emotions are too damned palpable
But I refuse to take the blame,

And if only my soul could be persuaded
To believe all that I am told
Perhaps my mind couldn't be invaded
Or my moonbeams raided

All Hail Discordia.

Heaven help me if I've sinned,
Shame on me...shame on me...shame,
May my brimstone ashes be scattered by wind:
Ingredi externi non serviam

You and me
Are lunacy
You and me
Dost Sol decree

All Hail Discordia.

The watery raindrops upon my head,
The epoch torture...Eris laughed,
A voice of hope, a feeling of dread,
Chaos tamed --Ewige Blumenkraft

Somewhere there is a setting sun,
A mission failed, a purpose lost:
Ali a la alibi...
Lady Luna's lunacy crossed

Shame on me...shame on me...shame
Shame on me...shame on me...shame
Shame on me...shame on me...shame
My fortune stays the same

All Hail Discordia.

I think you're proving one of Mr. Clark's points, that values are
observer-dependent.  A CD-ROM is not an observer, and so a "value" solely on
a CD-ROM does, indeed, mean nothing.  Simarily, a "value" floating in some
Platonic ether wouldn't mean anything either.  Only in a person (or some
presently hypothetical alternative such as an AI or alien) does a value take
on a meaning.

Naturally, *professing* a value is different from *having* a value.  You have
a value if your actions reflect it.

This is Dennett's position, that free will is an way to interpret extremely
complicated entities, rather than an actual property of such entities.
 Current conventional wisdom holds that complex entities always seem
free-willed to themselves, because no entity possessing complexity equivalent
to that of arithmetic can completely explain itself.  "Free will" is a factor
of the amount unexplained, not of the amount explained.

How to handle the situation where an entity sees itself as free-willed but
another can fully predict it is very messy.  Adequately understanding it
probably requires concepts far beyond those available to people as we don't
seem able to manage that amount of knowledge.  At present it's entirely
hypothetical.

I don't know -- try the Web.  Incidentally, this month's Nutrition
Action Healthletter says that unless you live in the South (of the USA),
you can't get enough vitamin D from sun exposure between October and
March.  Probably related to someone else's post that you don't get much
UV from a sun below 30 degrees from the horizon (I don't think the sun
was much above that at noon today here in the Bay Area).

I'm reminded of a custom among a previous generation of explorers and
frontiersmen, the "Mountain Men" in the U.S. Rockies: The Rendezvous.  At a
known time in the Spring of each year these folks would gather at a known
spot to trade infomation and other goods, before disbursing again into the
wild.  Rendezvous was a key element of the culture of these fascinating
characters (and apparently one hell of a party) and something we should
strongly consider.

Especially with the possibility of calving off copies or subsets of
ourselves, I can see gatherings like the Rendezvous of the American Mountain
Men at star systems along our paths of outward migration.  I suggest that as
the time for the diaspora approaches, Extropy Institute should consider
selection and publishing of the sites for these events to be a high priority.
 Pushing a growing archive of information outward from one Rendezvous to the
next may be one of the most importnat things we do as a group thousands and
millions of years along our life-lines.

With the reissue of _The Probability Broach_, everyone has had a new
opportunity to say how wonderful it is.  I found it deeply flawed.
Here are the gripes that I remember after ~13 years:

- All female characters are Heinlein heroines.
- The goodguys survive because the badguys never use their guns.
- Unable to stop the badguys' evil plan preemptively (because that
	would be coercive), our heroes blow them up accidentally.
	This is described as a triumph of free will.
- As is Bear's double existence, as if gametes were chosen consciously.
- Griswold's chilling reputation is presented but never justified.
- I can accept a talking gorilla.  I can accept a gorilla with an English
	surname.  But a gorilla with an English *hyphenated* surname?
	(And does the wrist-gadget pronounce it Fanshaw?)

Am I alone in my opinion?  Did I misread or misremember?
Are some of the flaws corrected in the new edition?

The best way to suppress genius is social democratic schools. E.g. we don't
get grades the first six years of school, and the idea of special schools or
classes for the smart is unthinkable.

You have to be a legitimate child of the social democracy to even think of
asking if a person "deserves" what he is given by his parents or others or
otherwise rightfully acquires, or what value he is to society. Also, my
parents might very well have worked for their money and your not letting
them give them to me to me is a serious constraint of *their* freedom.
This is even worse than imposing that the state must inherit everything
when one dies; at least then you could possibly give it away first.

Your previous assertion that old growth is being used for furniture is
wrong. Furniture that is solid wood, not vernier, is of such high value
that it must be 1) of hardwood (not a typical characteristic of old
growth) and 2) have beautifully luminescent grain, i.e. that which has
burl, or curly grain. Old growth has very straight grain wood, and is
useless for furniture, with the exception of rosewood and other exotics
from equatorial rain forests. Old growth is good for large wood beams,
and for pulping into paper. Granted that some paper companies, like
Weyerhauser, are experimenting with fast growth pine and cottonwood
hybrids, but such farms are plagued by problems with soil retention, so
any given ground is worthless after two or three generations of such
fast growth trees (6-15 years total). Such agriculture is the exception,
not the rule. The fact that a lumber company does not have to put in the
investment in planting, thinning, and pruning old growth like it does
with its highly sensitive hybrids, makes old growth more cost effective
to harverst than agricultural wood.

Another factor that has speeded the harvesting of old growth here in the
US and Canada in the last 8 years is the fall of the USSR. No kdding.
With the opening of the Siberian wilderness to western lumber
exploitation, US companies, especially those who had significant
investments in purchasing old growth land outright, had to harvest that
wood as soon as possible before cheap lumber from Siberia got onto the
open market. So they helped engineer the US Gov't restriction of
harvesting off USG land (you don't seriously think they'd roll over so
easily for a damn owl, do you?), to help boost the price enough to
offset the flood of private old growth on the market. The USG loved it,
because then they could look like they were doing good for the
environment (only the environment on their land), while also setting up
a future high value market for Russian lumber, that would help pay off
their buddies in Moscow enough to go along with arms reductions, etc etc
etc....

Well, the bad guys don't want to die in a firefight any more than the 
good guys.  There is plenty of shooting in the next few novels, if thats

triumphant.

Well, they're parallel universes, guess the Bear family-trees were

Well, if you're going to have a surname, why *not* have a hyphenated

Fanshaw.  

Jeez, looks like you've got no sense of humor.

You are confusing short-rotation trees (hybrid poplars, for example)
with longer term, but still not old-growth, trees.  These medium-term
tree farms may have trees grow for twenty years or more before 
harvest.  If you ever drive in Florida along the bend between the 
panhandle and the penisula, you'll pass these tree farms for hours.

There are no cheerleaders here!  (although anyone who wants to wear a 
short skirt may do so...)  If you are reading this list, you have a 
position on the team.  We need people to scrimmage with opponents to 
expansion.  We need people to draw charts and diagrams that the rest of 
us can use.  We need people to write the game books.  We need coaches to 
provide vision and guidance, to boost morale, to train the speciality 
teams.   We need the people who invented the game to show us how far we 
have progressed.  We need people to produce the equipment, design the 
uniforms, and sell the advertising space in the big stadiums.  

In short, we need everyone's abilities.  Who cares whether you are a 
genius or not, whether you have ever tackled writing a book or

Not everyone gets to run into the end zone, but someone has to pass the

This reason for emigrating to the US also applies to those of us who stay
here.  The point bears emphasis.  I often encounter tired attempts to justify
statism based on the consent I supposedly imply by not leaving.  In fact, I
stay in the US for many benefits, few of which I attribute to statists.  I
like many aspects of the local culture, appreciate the climate and terrain,
find my friends and family nearby, and speak American fluently.  By staying I
most emphatically do *not* waive my right to resist statist coercion.

Implied consent, in contrast to express consent,  relies on presumptions
derived from actions, in contrast to speech.  It implies, above all, that you
have not expressly objected to what others would imply you mean.

No.
Some thing happening in a past you did not live will not affect you.
If I was planning to go into the past to kill my parents,
It would be my future, not my past.
Being there (in the "past") makes it my present, 
and being a representative of the present, 
my past (it's future) is it's( the present's ) past.
You probably have to read that a few times.
The present's future happened in it's past.
Yet, the past only exists because it is being replayed in the present
(but that's beside the point).
[just for fun I will say,"The present's future happenED in it's present."]
If you are confused start thinking of time as space.

It is space-time to learn about space-time.
The time period (as a static mold not evolving) 
is only made of it's spacial structures.
(Space-time - time = space.)
Going back in time is really just going to a space like your "past"
(the space you are *presently* imagining and calling past).
So, by that, time-space travel seems possible.

hmm...think about this...
time does not exist without space,
space does not exist without time.
What is 0 + 0, and why do I try to disprove existance?
<sigh>I hate it when I do this.
I hope some one understands.

appealing things to me about anarcho capitalism, is that it will allow for
people to set up non mandatory socialist/communal situations as long as they
do not force anyone else to do so.
To say "you call you yourself an Extropian , but you don't want (pick a meme:
going into outer space, uploading, libertariansm, atheism, smart drugs,
longevity, whatever)"  it reminds one  of a "party line", and exclusionary,
closed circle thinking. Some pople may agree on some principles and not
others, this is a phiosophy- not a set of doctrines, a religion or written in
stone dogma.
I agree that free market is proper for developing technology - seems pretty
obvious to me,  but I rahter _strongly_disagree with telling other people
what "Extropians" can think or not.

ON WITH THE AUTOMORPH!!!

That would be a new wrinkle indeed, when the nuerotransmitters start

Sovereign national states are, if nothing else, a lot more diverse. Making
a more diverse "national ecosystem" EU is trying very hard to make us all
very uniform. I hate that.

BTW i dont think that the spaceprogram is very important right now. It
really ought to wait some decades before the technolgy is more refined.
There's a huge conscience-implosion going on right now with most of the
world focusing on the internet, multimedia, comunication, simulators, cad
etc. All of wich will probably lead to some kind of singularity. So
sometimes later we probably can fly to space in small private spacecrafts
powerered with Drexler-like diamond engines. why not wait and let the
explosion happen then?

Omega, this is tying up loose ends, just in case you're peering in from the
disengaged ethereal limbo all lurkers inhabit.

First, we were exploring the curious coordination dynamics between the
physiological *way* in which Feynman thought, and *what* he thought of in
mathematically semantic terms.  *How* he thought was *why* he described how
reality works.  A section of this follows:

Omega: <The genius of Feynman was often attributed to the fact that in the
middle of a difficult problem, he would stop what he was doing and suddenly
shift to a different viewpoint.>

RJ: <Voila!  Sum-over-the-perspectives/sum-over-the-histories describes
reality.  Russell (the positivists) and independently Edmund Husserl, were
working on this line at about the same time roughly a full generation
before Feynman's breakthroughs, but Sartre picked it up and spread it
around more contemporaneously.>

Omega: <Strange that the very process that was responsible for the genius
inside of Feynman's head was what led him to confirm in physical reality
what these philosophers had been saying a generation before.>

Secondly, and very closely related to this, we broached the timeless topic
of the correlation between objective reality (physical spaces) and
subjective reality (mental spaces of mathematical semantics).  A sample
follows:

Omega wrote 2/1/97 in "Von Neumann's Mistake": <Of course, this just begs
the question of the priority of, and relation between, mental spaces and
physical spaces.  One of the biggest unanswered questions in the philosophy
of science is the uncanny correlation physical reality and the totally
arcane branches of mathematics that sometimes get discovered centuries
before they are shown to have any relationship to physical reality.>

The very short answer to these links, is that the universe is
self-consistent.  As Kant put it in the chapter 'Analytic of Concepts' of
"Critique of Pure Reason":  "The conditions *a priori* of any possible
experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of
any objects of our experience."

The longer answer begins with what must be true for self-consistency to be
a property of the universe we know.  We are purposeful, meaningful beings;
purpose and meaning cannot sneak into the universe, they precede us.  No
existent region is not imbued with purpose, the universe is whole and
open-ended.  If any speck of the universe is physically random, then it all
is, and no intelligibility can arise.

Those who believe the universe is random activity, purposeless and
meaningless, are in a Fourier space (in your terms) turned away from truth.
 They have nothing meaningful to say in a meaningless universe.  They are
not serious, only wastefully playful, in a purposeless universe.  They are
barbaric, in that only might can ever be right in such a universe.  I agree
with Boethius in "The Consolation of Philosophy" where he concludes that
they "not only cease to be powerful, but cease to be at all.... cease to
exist themselves."  Those who deify chance do not have absolute, complete,
unqualified existence.

I am saying that the concepts of randomness and probability are virtually
synonymous with ignorance.  They are of an epistemological order, not an
ontological order.  The evolutionary growth of intelligence is measured by
a steady decline in aimless behavior, and a steady increase in coherently
purposeful behavior.  Individuals drifting through life, or harboring
unresolved conflicting purposes, are not as intelligent as those who
doggedly pursue the truth, whether narrowly or broadly.  Intentionality is
how we tap into the purpose that imbues the universe and gives rise to our
semantically meaningful concepts, such as mathematics.  The intentional
movements of our bodies in relation to ourselves, our environment, and to
others taps into the design inherent in the universe.  Semantically
meaningful information arises from the functional couplings with others,
produced by mutual intentions within a co-evolving environment.

We try very hard to statistically fit our mathematical symbols to reality,
but we cannot logically infer a fit, induction must be used not deduction. 
The centrality of metaphors (and metonymy) to our semantically meaningful
exchanges is because we must use them when our symbols don't match a
reality which is simply too rich and fine-grained for our symbols to
closely approach.

Symmetrical translations of spacetime arising from our bodily behavior lie
at the foundation of our semantics; the priority of relations consists in a
metaphorical mapping from physical space to mental space.  Whatever
statistical fit our mathematics has with physical reality is traced back to
this.  Giambattista Vico in "New Science" (1744), put forth as an axiom the
"universal principle of etymology in all languages:  words are carried over
from bodies and from the properties of bodies to signify the institutions
of the mind and spirit."  This is now the foundation of modern cognitive
psychology (see George Lakoff, Ruth Millikan, Gerald Edelman, etc.).

Since our bodies move according to our intentions, which are formed within
our evolutionarily preferred value patterns, the linkages between
mathematical concepts, emotions, meaning, design, and aesthetics are
strong. Information specifying our coordinative relations amongst our
constituent parts and between ourselves and our environment is of high
order meaning to us.  Such meaning is entirely contextual, specific to the
task before us.  The movements of the body are inseparable from the
thoughts of the mind.  The formation of our language itself depends on our
behavior.  As we behave in specialized ways, our language and knowledge,
our thinking itself, branches away from each other; we think in different
Fourier spaces because we behave in different Fourier spaces.  Mathematical
semantic technology and tautologies are in mental space alone; mathematics
is essentially the study of stable relations among stable or invariant
mental objects.  That mathematics correlates at all to physical space is
because the universe is self-consistent, we pick up valuable concepts from
physical space and intentionally reapply them to it.

Omega: <And the pathways between the varying [Fourier] spaces could well
have varying degrees of constriction/resistance.  Strange, how in the
purely abstract realm of memetics and cognitive process, that this gives us
such a remarkably strong basis for applying the metaphors of fluid dynamics
in such a meaningful way.>

It is very productive to think of patterns of thought in terms of river
channels, with "constriction/resistance" reflected in their curves, falls,
shallows, currents, floods, etc.  The physiology of
"constriction/resistance" is what I was describing in my examples of
preferred evolutionary branches of ontogeny, preferred protein folding
spaces, preferred protein design spaces, preferred mental activity
patterns, etc.  Virtually everywhere you turn in the biological sciences,
preferred physical structures and preferred dynamic patterns turn up; not
randomness, but design.  The most highly adaptive dynamic structures, such
as our brains and immune systems, are most aptly described with liquid
realm metaphors, because the biophysical "constriction/resistance"
parameters force them to "flow" in between chaotic and ordered dynamic
patterns.

Omega: <I find it amazing that so few of those interested in uploads are
paying any attention to this lack of analog in proposed upload schemes.  
Digital is nice, but this business of waveform families and their associate
spaces is not in any way insignificant.>

This "learned ignorance" touches on the "free will vs. group-think" thread.
 The unexamined metaphysical presuppositions of the age are greatly
inhibitory to creative breakthroughs in scientific knowledge or humanistic
wisdom.  The pervasive digital/computer metaphor has made many otherwise
intelligent individuals appear to be "bit-drunk."  I believe progress would
gain the fast track again when excitement over the latest "toy" wanes,
computers are taken for granted, and the search for novelty leads back to
the ever-fertile fields of analog devices.  I weary of the "Digital Age"
media-hype already, I'll announce (perhaps prematurely) the dawn of, what
else, the "Post-Digital Age."

We also must keep in mind, that meaning arises from the movements of the
body as it functionally couples with others against the background of the
external environment.  What forms of bodies uploads will inhabit, will
determine what meanings will arise within them.  Certainly human meanings
will not arise or be sustained in non-human bodies.

Omega wrote 2/1/97 in "Von Neumann's Mistake": <With this comes an
understanding that a generalized math capable of reconciling all the
Fourier spaces within reality is going to require a system that combines
continuous differential equations with fractals and other forms of discrete
math into a seamless whole.>

Such a system would include difference equations, among other forms of
discrete math, and would require quite novel philosophical underpinnings to
seamlessly conjoin them all.  Metaphysically, we would do well to jettison
the assumption that the universe is isotropic, assume that the Planck and
gravitational constants are only locally constant (if not downright
variable), and develop a physical explanation that would shore up the
legitimacy of Einstein's assumption of a constant light speed.  Scientific
statements we make about reality should be radically local in their scope,
not universal, in keeping with the metaphysical presupposition of discrete
Fourier spaces with analog connections across boundaries.

No, we won't.

In order for any thinking to be done at the fringes, the fringes have to
be moving slower than light.  (See "Universal Non-Point of Light.")  To
put it another way, you can't lose touch, in the warm n' fuzzy sense,
with something that isn't thinking.  So fringe A can send a beam of
light to fringe B, going in the opposite direction, which will reach it
in a finite amount of time.  Fringe B's reply will reach fringe A, again
in a finite amount of time (*).  So the fringes never fall out of
communication - as long as relativity applies, we remain one big happy
geometrically expanding family.

(*)  In fact, exactly the same amount of time.  If B measures the amount
of time it takes the ray to reach A, and the amount of time it takes the
reply to return (assuming composition is instantaneous), they are
exactly equal - assuming B's velocity is constant.  Question 1:  Why? 
Doesn't B move farther away from A after the reply is sent?  Question
2:  B says sending=reply.  Fringe A says the same thing, except A's
"sending" is B's "reply", and vice versa.  Doesn't this mean
sending=reply=sending=reply=sending..., thus making (by induction)
communication time constant even as A and B move farther and farther
away from each other?

Certain folk believe that they can assign to Life whatever meaning they
choose.  That, in other words, value is arbitrary.  I contend that this
is a circular belief system, and one imposed by evolution.

Let me define "circular belief".  A circular belief system is one that
you hold because you hold it, and, if you *stopped* holding it, would
not pop up again.  What atheists hate about religious beliefs is their
circularity.  People are brought up to believe in God, to believe that
believing in God is Right, and that questioning their belief is wrong. 
Many of these people, if they stopped believing that memeset, would have
no reason to start believing in God again.  In other words, I'm talking
about the people who hold their religion out of a sheer refusal to think
about its absurdity, start over with a clean slate, and let the best
memetic system win.  (I am not saying all religious people are like
this.  After all, some born atheists convert to theism, blank-slate.)

The defining quality of circular religious systems is that they are
imposed on the mind to begin with, by culture or evolution, and that if
the imposed starting postulate is abandoned, they stop being plausible.

John K Clark wants to explore the galaxy, because it's "fun".  He thinks
this makes exploring the galaxy meaningful.  Suppose I abandon the
postulate that pleasure is valuable.  Is there any way to get back to
this postulate again?

Evolution says:  Pleasurable things are valuable by default.  This
almost, but not quite, is the definition of pleasure - since many belief
systems say that all sorts of pleasurable things are anti-valuable.

So that's the seed of the circular belief system.
Now abandon the idea that pleasurable things are valuable.
Now, without accepting it as a postulate, prove it.

If you can't do this, it's a circular belief system, and one which I -
denying the basic postulate, just as John K Clark denies the existence
of God - have no reason to accept, until somebody comes out with some
kind of rational reasoning in favor of the basic postulate.

Moreover, I'd like to remind everyone that this issue doesn't seem at
all Euclid-arbitrary to me.  It's not a matter of:  Some accept this
postulate, some don't.  At worst it's Godel undecidable, which means
that you can accept either postulate and be consistent, but one of them
is untrue to the extent of forcing a new definition of "number".  But I
think that the basic postulate - "meaning is arbitrary" - is simply
WRONG, and what I want everyone to accept is that anybody who starts out
with this postulate is simply WRONG until they justify it.

If I say:  "The Meaning of Life is pleasure" or "The Interim Meaning of
Life is Singularity", I can *justify* it.  I can argue it to somebody
who doesn't start out believing it.  Rightly or wrongly isn't the issue;
the point is that neither are basic postulates built into the system.

"The Meaning of Life is arbitrary."
"Whatever is fun to Observer X, is meaningful."
Well, I don't believe it yet.
How do I reason to it without accepting it as given?

Well?  What is it?  I'm waiting?  I realize that a human being is more
complex than a 386, but what difference does it make?  A 386 can
maximize about as well as a human, even if it has less resources to do
it with.

Again.  Why does something acting to maximize X make it valuable, and
why is X valuable if a human acts to maximize it but not if a 386 acts
to maximize it?

I've stated that there's no ethical difference 'tween a human maximizing
something and a thermostat following the same strategy.  Respond, remain
silent, or claim I'm "obviously wrong", refuse to back it up, and change
your name to Searle.

I'm setting out to prove no such thing.  Nor does it follow from
observer-independent value that life is valueless.  My claim is that
observer-dependent value in the direct, pleasure-center sense requires a
definition of "value" which is not intuitively compatible with what
*anyone* means, including all participants in this dicussion, by asking
whether life is worth living.  Thus making observer-dependent values no
values at all.

Now you're citing something with a vague bit of justification:  You
state that *meaningful* maximization requires *resistance* to
de-maximizing forces.

Someday, computer security systems may put up quite a fight if you try
to turn them off over the 'Net.  This is not the place to retype GURPS
Cyberpunk, but possible actions range from severing connections to
repairing damaged programs to rewriting entrance architectures to impose
new password-challenges.  I could write, right now, an application that
resisted death in a dozen ways, from trying to copy itself elsewhere to
disabling the commonly used off-switch.  If someone can't resist, do
they lose their right to live?  This is the "fetuses/computers have no
rights because they are dependent on us" absurdity all over again.  If I
make you dependent on me, even for blood transfusions, do you lose your
rights as a sentient being?

There are dozens of far-from-sentient classical AIs that will attempt to
achieve goals using combinations of actions.  From where I sit, I see a
folder called "shrdlu" which contains a computer program that will
attempt to stack up blocks and uses chained actions to that effect. 
Does this program have any ethical relevance?  Within its world, do
stacked blocks have meaning?

Don't give me that "sad that you can't tell the difference" copout. 
Tell me what the fundamental difference is, and why "maximizing X" is
not sufficient to make X valuable, and how humans maximizing X includes
the key ingredient.

Nope, I'm saying *your* philosophy leads to nihilism.  I'm saying your
philosophy of value has not *told* me what the difference between humans
and thermostats is.  If you're going to post condescending remarks, you
should read enough of the thread to know who to condescend to!  Also,
YOUR philosophy is a disorder of the affects TOO, so nyah nyah nyah nyah

Name as many as you want, because I can PROVE that a giant
hashtable-thermostat can maximize anything a computational mind can. 
I.e. REALLY BIIG (but less than 3^^^3) lookup table, duplicates inputs
and outputs, no mind, but works as well.  Again, what difference does it
make what does the maximizing?

Why is tickling the pleasure centers significant?  You're simply ducking
the question.  Evolution makes a lot of things *pleasurable*, this
causes us to assign them value, but I want to know if things *really*
have value that isn't just a trick of our genes!  If our genes made us
think that sadism was inherently valuable, would it be?  You've named
things that we think of as not merely pleasurable, but *holy* - but John
K Clark would laugh at quite a few "holy" values.

Now, it is possible that pleasure has inherent value.  David Pearce
thinks so.  He could even be right; subjective conscious pleasure could
be inherently valuable.  In which case the logical course would be
wireheading on the greatest possible scale, using only the Power
necessary to "turn on" the Universe and then devoting all those useless
thinking circuits to pleasure-center emulation.  And yet, some deep part
of us says:  "This isn't meaningful; this is a dead end."

I've been at peace with the world around me, while listening to Bach, if
at few other times.  It moves me.  I admit it.  But I still have the
moral courage to defy my own sense of outrage and say, "So what?" 
Simply because I assign value to a thing does not necessarily make it
valuable!  Why is assigning value to Bach better than assigning value to
cats?  And if the latter is wrong, why not the first as well?

Your intuitive definition of "value" is "All pleasurable activities that
I have not categorized as 'dead ends'."  My response:  "So what?

Maybe... but unlike most people, I can't be sure which of my
philosophies are genetic and which environmental.  As an Algernon, I
might have wound up adopting close to exactly the same philosophical
worldview if raised in Korea, although perhaps a bit later (no
computers, no Internet).

As I write this, I can think of two (possible) Algernons who seem almost
eerily identical - not in knowledge, not in skills, probably not in life
history... but in writing style and outlook on life, *indistinguishable*
to me, and probably any normal human looking on.  Similarly, the only
other known Countersphexist happened upon my Algernon site while looking
up "Singularity" on Alta Vista.  And I'd bet money that a certain other
happened on "Algernon's Law" while looking up "intelligence
enhancement".

So it could be true that I'd be a lot different if brought up in Korea. 
But the evidence available to me suggests that innate ability levels do
an awful lot to determine what philosophy you choose, perhaps to the
point of simple genetic determinism.

        Because it might not happen.  Although I agree with your post in
spirit, it still has tones of singularity-based reliance (which in my
opinion is of the same calibre as a deus-based reliance.)  While I agree
that there *is* a huge world-focus upon computers and global-village
communication, I still think that there should be attempts at maximizing our
[society's] current potential in all the other areas...including space
travel.  Nothing beats a sure thing, and the only way to make things sure is
to *kineticize* and maximize their potential.

Speaking as someone who thinks that the Singularity is unknowable and
extrapolating beyond it is silly, let me also say that I explicitly
agree with E. Shaun on this one - simply on practical grounds.  Our
attempts at space travel, however futile in direct terms, did a HELL of
a lot to advance the Singularity.  At a guess, by a decade at least. 
None of that would have happened if we'd waited for the Singularity to
save us.

I speculated in my Singularity site about how Powers might solve math
problems, for the simple reason that the speculation might prove
necessary for building first-stage AIs.  Any science may by pure
serendipity advance the Singularity, even if - or especially if - it is
directed at goals so astronomical as to practically require a
Singularity to power it.

(Also, I don't believe the ends justify the means.  Strictly from a
pragmatic viewpoint, humans aren't built to be pragmatists.  When we
try, things go wrong, others stop trusting us, and we get our souls all
icky.  So don't rely on the Singularity for moral justification.)

Nope, not at all. Viruses of the mind are not memes; they are social
organisms, complete with cultural artifacts, that USE memes to spread. I
think we are in serious agreement.

How about Rupert Sheldrake's idea that memories are not stored in the =
mind at all, but that the mind (cerebellum?) serves as antenna picking =
up the memories via "morphic resonance" from the space time continuum  =
...for the uninitiated, this assumes the space time continuum is a =
memory continuum like a memory surface except muli-dimensional.

Welcome to one of the big surprises of cognitive science.  We know the
hippocampus is involved in LTM (long-term memory) formation, because
people who lose the hippocampus can't form new memories - although, in
retrospect, they can retrieve the old LTM just fine.

So, with those newfangled PET scanners and other close-to-real-time
neuroimaging tools, they finally get a chance to see what happens when
people *retrieve* LTM.  Guess what lights up?

Not the hippocampus.
Not the cerebral cortex.
The cerebellum.

And if anybody can even *begin* to explain this, I haven't heard about
it.  My own guess is that the cerebellum does constraint propagation or
some other kind of constraint-to-visualization assembly, and that is
what motor skills, LTM retrieval, and (another guess) spatiotemporal
visualization have in common.

Thank you Guru Eliezer for those words of wisdom. Your pride is justified,  
only someone who has achieved the 800'th level of SAT enlightenment could  
have deduced that a Turing Machine was deterministic even if it is not  
predictable. Help me follow in your glorious footsteps with my own humble  
query. Do you think that maybe that's why they call a Turing Machine a  
machine?       


        >This man is a Turing computationalist?        
        >Lemme 'splain something, friend.              


No, let me explain something to you buddy boy. I expect and want people to 
emphasize the weak points in my arguments, I rather like sarcasm even if it's 
directed at me, and insults don't bother me much, but deliberately  
misrepresenting my position is going way over the line. And and this was not 
just a misunderstanding, you're not dumb enough to think that a deterministic  
machine would be a revelation to me.
              

        >What I'm trying to say is that whatever choice you make, it *will*          
        >have a causal explanation within the computational framework.


Within a computational framework sure,  but not within my computational  
framework, and that makes all the difference. I don't understand myself,  
I don't know what I will do next and this is why I feel free. This feeling  
is not an illusion, I  really do feel free.
              

        >Ya can't lift yourself up to some pure ethical plane and say that         
        >your "choice" is made of your own "free will" while a thermostat        
        >does not choose to keep the temperature at a certain setting.  


I said  "A being has free will if and only if he can not predict what he 
will do next", the only part of this definition that is vague is "a being". 
If  you insist that a thermostat is a being then I would have to say that 
being had free will.
              

        >After all, you know a lot more about yourself than a thermostat does 
        

That could be true but is far from obvious. I am astronomically smarter 
than a thermostat but the thing I'm trying to understand, myself, is 
astronomically  more complex.
           

        >The point I'm trying to make is that you'll assign meaning to         
        >something, for causal reasons explicable entirely by Turing-based         
        >forces.  


A keen grasp of the obvious.
             

        >The question is - will you assign meaning based on "what you want"         


Yes, but your way is much better, you will assign meaning in ways you don't  
want.


       >which is a fancy way of saying you'll let evolution do it for you?         
       

The reason I have the personality I do is because  something caused it to be 
that way, my genes and my environment. I'm trying very hard to figure out  
why this should be depressing, but am not having much luck. Of course,  
if different causes, different reasons, had acted on me then I would it find
determinism depressing and would have been a great fan of the only  
alternative, randomness.
             

        >Or will you assign meaning based on a genuinely true chain of logic?          


Which is a fancy way of saying you'll let the meaning of life do it for you.         
           

        >In short, will you reason it out or accept the dictates of your        
        >genes?


So you want to reason it out, you want to find the reasons, the causes, that 
effects the machine that calls itself Eliezer Yudkowsky to act in the way it 
does. That sounds like a worthwhile thing to do to me, but understand,  
you'll be able to find some of the causes, but Turing proved you can't find  
them  all.       
           

        >I'm asking if anything has any value at all.


Yes, a dollar has the value of 100 cents,  PI has the value 3.14149...

Value is the amount of a specific measurement, in this thread the specific 
measurement I'm talking about is the desire to maximize. 
                   

        >You say it has value?  Well, I can take apart your brain right down         
        >to the level of individual atoms and demonstrate that you assigned         
        >it value simply because it tickled your pleasure centers.  


No shit Sherlock! 
              

        >And saying "Yes, it has value, to me" is simply ducking the point.          
            

How is that ducking the point? How does that prove that it  doesn't have 
value for me?


        >And I am not impressed.  If I build a computer programmed to spew         
        >out:  "Cats have value to me", fundamentally, nothing happens.          


It's not important if you're impressed or not, you're not the one who likes  
cats, it's only important if the computer is impressed or not.


        >So what?


So cats have value to the computer.


        >I simply deny that value is an observer-dependent thing.          


Then you have fallen so in love with your own theory that you simply deny the  
results of experiments that are in conflict with it. That has never worked in  
Science in the past and is certainly not a path to the truth. Ask a thousand  
people what they value and what they don't and you will get a thousand 
different answers.
               

        >You can have, in memory, a declarative statement that "X has value".          
        >So what?  A CD-ROM can do the same thing with a lot less fuss.  


At least a thermostat changes its state, a CD-ROM is static, and a mind that 
is static is not a mind.
              

        >We can't make things have value just by declaring they do.  


Why not? We can and do make value judgments,  and we do so a thousand times  
a day. You say we error when we do so, but what are the consequences of that  
error? Where is the collapsed bridge? Exactly what is it that goes wrong?
                    

        >Our declaration that "X has value" will cause us to act in such a         
        >way as to maximize X.           
        
Yes.


        >So what?  

So we maximize X and are happy.


        >What good is it, unless X really *is* valuable?


According to my theory, an anvil is valuable to a blacksmith but it is not  
valuable to a man trying to swim across the English Channel. According to  
your theory the anvil would be of equal value to both. I'm right, you're not.

        
        >74 degrees is the Meaning of Life for a thermostat? 


74? Ridiculous! It's 42.


         >I am jumping out of the system.           
         >I'm saying that to *me*, acting to maximize X *has* *no* *value*.


You are not jumping out of THE system, you are just jumping out of YOUR 
system. If you really believe in the above for any X, then your life would  
indeed have no value to YOU. You're still alive so I rather doubt that is  
the case.

Things are very different for me. I think many things have value , but 
If  X = "The Meaning of Life" then to *me*, acting to maximize X *has* *no*  
*value* to me.
                

        >I see no place for intelligence, consciousness, brains, neurons,         
        >thinking, subjectivity, or really much of anything in this worldview.


I see no need for anything to give its value seal of approval to 
consciousness. I do see a very great need for consciousness to give its 
value seal of approval to other things.


        >At this point in our discussions, you usually change the rules by         
        >subtly redefining a term. My guess is that it will be "value". Well? 


I've already given you my definition of value, I am still happy with it and 
see no need to redefine it. I can't very well redefine your definition of 
value because you never gave me one.

PS: I probably should have waited an hour or two before I wrote this reply,     
    it wouldn't have had such an ill tempered tone, but there were reasons    
    that I acted as I did, even if I don't know what they were.

Well, I think the time has come to take my leave of this list.  The
damage done by the Prozac has finally been repaired through a program of
low self-esteem.  That means I have work to do, and this list has been
taking up all my working time.

I'd like to thank my friends on this list:
The ones who kept me up to date on upcoming events;
The ones who made moral accusations that I learned to counter;
The ones who suggested alterations to my personality;
The ones who forced me to speak clearly and slowly;
The ones who told me things I didn't already know;
The ones who crystallized my understanding;
And above all, first and foremost:
The ones who wrote arguments I hadn't already heard.

Damien Broderick, "Best Advice";
And also:
______________, "I'm Sure I've Forgotten Someone".
______________, "And Probably Two Of Them".

And to all the others, who were not strictly *necessary*, but still
useful and fun to be with - thanks.

I've written over 100 pages - not K, pages - of explanatory posts to
this mailing list.  They'll make a fine set of Web pages someday.  I
want you to know that, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have anything
but nontechnical appeals to intuition when somebody asked me why the
Powers wouldn't squish us like bugs, or what good the Singularity was.

I hope that I've given more to this Extropian List than the total amount
of effort put into it divided by the number of posting listmembers, or
P.  I hope that for any given individual R, I have enlightened R by an
amount greater than the amount that R has enlightened me (*).  I hope
very strongly that I have repaid in equal measure any efforts directed
specifically at me.

[(*)  This is not, of course, possible for every person to do, and
therefore more of an ideal than a serious (and seriously arrogant)
goal.  Also, this does not mean that I have to enlighten the list as a
whole to the same extent that the list enlightened me, which would
require that I match the total creative output of everyone on the list. 
Duplicate enlightenments count, so that the same enlightenment among P
listmembers is valued at E * P.]

In short, I hope I put more in than I took out, and that in retrospect,
every member of the list would have asked me to join.  Extropy, and
capitalism, are supposed to work that way.

I'm the fifth person to bail out.  I hope this doesn't start a
stampede.  If it does start a stampede, I'm already stampeding and it
was Lyle's fault.

I intend to unsubscribe from the Extropian Mailing List completely after
a few days, not just stop posting.  Messages sent here will not reach
me.

I wasn't attempting to deliberately misrepresent your position.  I was
just attempting to make the point that, in your version of the Universe,
people assign value for completely traceable causal reasons.  The only
question is whether the reasons are traceable to reason or evolution. 
You say that if traceable to reason, they are "imposed"; if to
evolution, they are "free".  I say exactly the reverse.

I have chosen to identify with my reason, rather than my
evolution-imposed emotions.  What I decide to do, is me.  A "chain" of
reason, no matter how inexorable, simply makes me inexorably correct; it
imposes *nothing* on me that I do not believe to be right.  Evolution
isn't as polite.

You appear to have chosen to identify with your heart.  What you want to
do, is you.  An emotion, no matter how overpowering, simply makes you
overpowering; it imposes *nothing* on you that you do not want.  Reason
isn't as polite.

I take it back.  This isn't a dispute over semantics or circular belief
systems; we are genuinely living in different strata of the Universe,
and neither of us is missing the obvious.  We identify with different
parts of our selves.

I hope that I, my reason, will eventually assign non-subjunctive
positive value to something.  I don't want my emotions assigning
positive value to things that aren't really worth anything.

You, your emotions, already assign positive value to anything you want. 
You just don't want reason to get in your way.

Who says all is computation, and all else is superstition?
Who says Church-Turing is simply too restrictive?
Who is an atheist?
Who respects faith?
Who thinks consciousness is just information?
Who thinks qualia just don't compute?

Lord, thy name is irony.

Your recollection is accurate.

I do not recollect any stuff about free will, but the rest of it sucks

I completely agree. But even if we froze hardware development in computers
today we could probably squeeze two orders of magnitude better CAD/CAM
programs out of the technology. That alone would give us cheaper and more
reliable spacetravel.
We simply don't need something as radical as the singularity to achieve
much better space technology. But shure let's keep sending up a few rockets
now and then. But it's probably smarter right now to focus mostly on
comercial launches.

The world you *think* you're seeing, which is really just a data
structure. A good demonstration of this comes from experiments where
computers are programmed to change the displayed text when your eyes are
jumping from one place to another in a saccade. We seem to build up this
data structure inside our brains and only update it when we see movement,
but deactivate the movement-detectors when we move our eyes. Hence if the
text changes when your eyes are in motion we still 'see' the same text on
the screen until we examine it closely and suddenly realise that it's
changed. I found this a real shock the first time, but it's happened to me 
so often now that I just find it annoying. 

Another demonstration comes from the experiences of psychedelic users, who
(AFAIR) report that the objects they see are far more likely to move
around or change into something different than, say, for the perceived
world to split up into squares and zoom around their field of view as we
might expect if we were just seeing a pixel image from the retina. 
Changing a pixel-image of a plant-pot into a pixel-image of an elephant
would be hard work, but simply changing the object description in our data
structure from 'plant-pot' to 'elephant' or changing the coordinates in
space is easy.

Point well taken.  But I meant to contrast the relatively instantaneous and
universally interlinked  communications that we now enjoy, with the
intermittent and broken communications that will probably characterize
post-diaspora humanity.  I do not claim, pace your application of relativity,
that communication will prove impossible.  When our various quasi-transcended
children, diverging copies, and future selves try to phone home from far
galaxies, however, they will *not* enjoy the functional equivalent of a
long-distant call!

My mind in rage,                    I need know more,
In thirst of life,                  At the cost of war.
A beast once tamed,                 I chose to hear,
Escaped it's cage.                  And now I hunt.
Beware all ye who hide your words,  A skull is not a shield;
Your wisdom shall be mine.          Your thoughts I can divine.
The truth you seek,                 I shall not yield.
It shall be a lie.                  My mercy is a front.
No soul shall know thier striff     No one shall shed a tear.
While I prowl around inside.        The future shall be mine.

I think you are a bit influenced by the old empiricist philosophical
tradition stemming from Locke Berkely and Hume, which held that we
perceive only 'ideas' and 'impressions', as if what we perceived were a
kind of 'surface' only.  This is quite wrong.  What we *have* (or are?)
is 'ideas' or 'impressions' (our experiential gestalts considered in and
of themselves), what we*see* by means of that having, is the physical
world.

Can we agree to put it this way?  Lets say there are two senses to 'see'
and 'perceive': direct and indirect.  We don't directly perceive the
physical world, in the sense that we would if our experience of the
physical world were nothing but a sample of it; we perceive it indirectly,
by means of a bit of sampling plus lots of interpretation (some of it pre
-conscious, some conscious).

Actually, I kind of look at extropian artists and speakers as the
cheerleaders (some of whome I bet would look great in those little
skirts, he he!). Of course, any extropian cheerleader would be an
integral player on the team (full contact, anyone? ;0).

Question: John is obviously going on the track that there is only one
universe time line, and any attempt to influence the past results in the
immediate substitution of that future with another that accounts for the
influence of the time traveler, much like the story in Orson Scott Cards
novel _Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus_. Given the
result of Bell's inequality, is this still the accepted view of
space-time, or is there still a window for the multiversal theory?

Because singularities most likely are very dangerous and abrupt - it 
might be a very good idea to have a sizeable part of mankind spread out 
in case somebody for some reason comes up with goo or nasty SI.

Yes, it is fascinating how often energy is misused in a variety of areas. 
Still, it shows how fundamental the concept is to our culture and thinking.

The same goes for information - what *is* information really? Of course, 
that's heavy ontology and not necessarily answerable.

Well, I suppose that idea goes well with the New Age crowd, but I doubt 
there are any serious scientists who buy into morphic resonance, let 
alone that memories are stored outside the brain.

This model is BTW untestable, since it can explain away amnesia by saying
the brain has become a worse antenna, the hippocampal lesion syndrome of
inability to encode new long term memories by saying the sender part of
the brain is damaged and agnosias by saying a specific part of the brain
has lost their resonance. It is a worthless scientific theory unless 
those morphic fields can be measured or interacted with.

Sounds like a great idea. But the main question is how to choose these 
events? They obviously have to be reachable and in some sense natural. I 
imagine a growing hierarchy of these; a level 2 rendezvous is surrounded 
by level 1 rendezvouses etc. One could for example choose a triangular 
coordinate system based on the line between the sun and the galactic 
core, using subdivisions of the basic triangle (but how to do this in 3D? 
there are few good tesselations).

The problem with the estimate of only 175% chance of one intelligent
race per galaxy is that it relied on assumptions of the values of the
different factors in the equation (which you can find in Sagan's book,
Cosmos). Recently I had heard of this same gentleman plugging in new
assumptions based on data learned in the 25+ years since he formulated
this algorithm. He then came up with at least one intelligent race every
40-60 light years. I would be interested in seeing what the new data on
extrasolar planets does to this estmate.

When I made my original statement that there are no cheerleaders 
here, I seriously mean that everyone on this list can make a 
substantial contribution through ALL of their abilities, and that the 
talents of artistry and speaking would certainly be extremely 
necessary and central to expanding understanding of transhumanism and 
to the task of visioning.  The team would not survive if some 
individuals were singled out as less central to the game effort than 
others.

There are many government-owned forests in the US whose trees are sold
AT A LOSS to logging firms.  Why?  The Forest Service's budget is
based on the number of trees sold, not the net income.  They spend
more on (moron?) building logging roads than they get from tree sales.

For the purposes of this argument it doesn't matter a bit if reason or 
Evolution CAUSED you to act in a certain way, in both cases they are  
"imposed". If I make a logical decision, that means that out of an infinite 
number of choices I narrowed things down to one particular action. When 
somebody tells me that my choice was smart, logical, reasonable, that I had 
reasons (causes) for doing what I did, I am not embarrassed or insulted, 
I am flattered. 

When somebody tells me that my choice was stupid, illogical, unreasonable,  
that I had no reasons (no causes) for doing what I did, I am embarrassed and  
insulted, I am most certainly not flattered. 
          

        >I have chosen to identify with my reason, rather than my evolution        
        >imposed emotions.  
          

So, you have chosen to identify with evolution imposed reason. I don't wish  
to insult you so let me say that I think your choice is reasonable, there  
were reasons, causes, for you to make that decision. I'm not sure if the 
causes were in your genes or your environment and it doesn't matter, they're 
still causes.

"Want" is an emotion. You don't "want" your emotions assigning positive value  
to things, because that would make you sad, or at least, you think it would  
make you sad. You think the idea of maximizing intrinsic value (whatever that 
is) will make you happy, while maximizing subjective value will not.

Of course!  It's a propaganda cartoon.  The persons disagreeing with 
the author's political agenda are evil incarnate; those agreeing are 
models of decency and happiness.  The society, as depicted, works
because its members are such cartoon characters.

We aren't arguing determinism here.  It seems to me this is about what
we identify with.  If I identify with reason and act in accordance with
reason, I am free.  Determinism doesn't enter into it; truth does.  If
you identify with what you want and act in accordance with what you
want, determinism doesn't enter into it; desire does.

Determinism has no relevance to this sort of freedom - nor are *all*
*systems* possessed of free will, as your self-unpredictability
definition would have it.  The question is whether the choices *you*
make - *you* are what you identify with, be it head or heart - are
placed in your value/belief system (internal freedom) and successfully
acted upon (external freedom).  The relevance of your definition is that
if you know beforehand what decision you will make, it was probably
pre-defined (irrespective of your decision) and thus imposed.

I don't care where reason comes from.  I don't care if it's
evolution-imposed, blank-slate-deduced, or God-given.  All I care about
is if it's true.  The great revelation that I reason because I have
evolved to do so falls flat.  Reason says to reason also, and if it said
to stop reasoning, I would - uhhh...

> You decide to do things you don't want to do??? Why do you do them? 

Because they are justified.  I don't intend to play word-games here. 
There are cognitively real distinctions between want and decide, and I
am using them.  There is a difference between the "value" and
"justification" slots of goals.  Under normal circumstances, this rarely
shows up.  As a countersphexist, I run into it all the time; highly
justified goals have negative values for no real reason.  Now, under
those circumstances, you can decide to follow the value-slots or the
justification-slots.  Although my general cognitive systems are tuned to
follow the value, I try to hack it up so I follow the justification. 
What I want to do has no relation to what I have decided to do, but I
try to carry on anyway.

Again, you can use my concept of "formal ethical system" to see how this
corresponds to your argument.  To you, meaning is value.  High-value
goals have high meaning.  To me, meaning is justification.  Highly
justified goals have high meaning.

Tsk, tsk.  You're Johnkclarkomorphizing me.  I've decided that emotions
assigning positive value to things is not conducive to reaching
Singularity.  Maximizing intrinsic value is the only logical basis for a
goal system, while observer-arbitrary value is nothing to me.  No
emotion at all.

Well, not really, because emotions are part of the system that reasons
with respect to values, and if I somehow shut off the entire emotional
system, that would cripple my ability to reason about goals.  But I'm
sure you reason about what you "want", and see no conflict there either.

(Re: my "he is/I am" list.)
> I need a little help here, I don't see it.

I identify with the head, you with the heart.
Under the circumstances, our respective philosophies seem a bit ironic.

Here's an interesting question:

What is altruism?
Is it sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of others?
Or is it gaining your happiness through the happiness of others?

I would unconditionally answer #2.  Given the way these ironies go, I'd
guess you're #1, though a priori you'd seem likely to be #2.

exact sentiment. 

Ok, I'm leaving the room to go take a pee now, and I want to thank E. Shaun
Russell for his delightful poetry of transhuman concept, and Nadia for her
passion about art, and John Clark for his ever hilarious posts, and T.O.
Morrow for his exacting thoughts about extropians, and Katheryn for her
informed posts about women and feminism, and Hara Ra for his cleverness, and

Of _The Probability Broach_, I griped, and Michael Hohensee responded:

I don't mind that some women in the cast fit that description.  (I know
a few like that myself. Yum.)  I mind that they *all* do (there are no
bad or neutral women), and that they *talk* like Heinlein.

(As for good shots - Clarissa says she never misses with a plasma gun,
and in the sequel, plasma guns are said to be notoriously inaccurate.
I've got no sense of humor.)

:
: Well, the bad guys don't want to die in a firefight any more than the

That's not quite the point.  Everyone has a gun, but when the goodguys
are captured, the badguys don't *shoot* them, but lock them in a freezer
so they can inevitably escape.  (When Blofeld [or was it Goldfinger?]
said "No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die," he was alone in his
expectation. ;) )

But where is the moral lesson that is supposed to be the whole point?
I prefer the deus-ex-machina to be a bit less obvious, don't you?

Exactly.  And Bear initially accepted that, with the elaboration that
because he was of Western Indian descent, the ripples of the divergence
that began in Philadelphia hadn't reached his family tree.  But in the
final chapter he says, no, my parents had a son because they chose to!

If the chronicler can't mention Griswold's without going "brr",
I'd like to know why.  It's admittedly a small thing.

Sounds like we need some Schelling points!  In other words, to explicate this
game theory concept to the uninitiated, we need cooridination devices that
independent agents will choose without prior consultation.  An example of a
Schelling point:  If your friend told you to meet her in Paris, but did not
say where, you would probably head for the Eiffel tower.

I take Greg to suggest we avoid the need for Schelling points by choosing
meeting cooridinates beforehand--a great strategy so far as it goes, but one
that for obvious reasons might not work for all of the human diaspora.
 Anders suggested Schelling points based on the sun's relation to the galatic
core.  Using the Earth to derive a Schelling point seems pretty reasonable
for humans--but only if they remember their origins!  So here, too, we might
still face a cooridination problem.

So I'm led to ask:  Were you an intelligence wandering free and lonely in the
galaxy, where would you head to meet others?  What, in other words,
constitutes a universal Schelling point?

I offer a tentative answer:  The point where gravitational forces of the
universe sum to zero--galatic center, if you will.

Lastly, I note that if we can figure out the universal Schelling point, we
might discover that our alien peers have already started meeting there.
 Anyone have access to a decent-sized radio observatory?

No, really. 'Attractive' doesn't mean anything unless you have a 'to whom'

Your facetious definition of what a universal Schelling point might be
sparked my interest to think about it further. Humor is often employed
in order to glaze over seemingly absurd, paradoxal, or complex ideas;
sort of like a defense-mechanism. If we laugh at something, make humor
of it, we no longer feel necessitated to explore it further. We can move
on without be troubled by it further. I'm not saying this was the case
in this situation, but after reflecting on just what might entail a
Schelling point, I found it to be fairly difficult to pin down. We can
all imagine Schelling points, e.g., if you lost your child at an
amusement park, they would probably turn up at either the entrance or an
information booth (assuming average intelligence), but how do both the
child and parent come to this conclusion if the subject was not brought
up beforehand? The difficulty here seems to lie in the fact that though
many points can be ruled out via reason alone, we would use our
intuition to make the final decision. But then, what is intuition? Seems
like another tool for glazing over a complex issue, sort like the word
'instinctual' or superinducing 'God' into an argument. Intuition in this
case is refering to the empathy we must have for the other individuals
involved. After ruling out the majority of points via reason, we must
imagine which of the remaining points would be most sensical to the
others while keeping in mind that they are probably thinking the same in
relation to us. This sounds a lot like chess to me. Seems to be one of
the fundamental issues that still separates a human player from a
computer. Computers have several ways of attempting to attain intuition,
e.g., probability, fuzzy logic, etc., but all of these methods seem to
lack variables for the human psyche. Even if a computer can learn
certain idiosyncracies about its human opponent, the computer can only
apply what it has learned to the specific "game" it is playing. If the
computer has no record of the player trying to find a Schelling point in
Paris, the computer will not be able to create an isomorphism [as
defined by Hofstadter] between the game it knows and the "game" of
finding a Schelling point in Paris based on what it has learned about
the human player. It seems however that humans do have this power, the
ability to apply learned patterns to new circumstances. I imagine the
Schelling point test would be an incredible way of testing an AI.

Reason works great in showing you the best way to achieve your goals, but it 
is useless in deciding which goal to pick. If I stick my hand in a fire I can 
not think of any logical reason to pull it out. I know that the sensation 
coming from my hand is painful, but I can't prove it, and even if I could I 
certainly can't prove that pleasure is better than pain or life is better
than death or logic is better than illogic. I'm pulling my hand out anyway. 

There are some things  that are beyond logic, some thing that I don't need 
to prove to myself, like the fact that I'm conscious, and the fact that I 
don't like pain or death. I like logic because it has worked in the past and  
by induction I figure it will work in the future, but of course, I can't 
prove induction.
               

        >nor are *all* *systems* possessed of free will, as your

even a simple computer program, can not predict what it will do.

I certainly agree with that, but tell me, why isn't, "I scratched my nose

        >Reason says to reason also
                

Reason says no such thing, it doesn't give a hoot in hell if you're logical

by the way.

These are not word games. We are discussing some extremely difficult

it is only because it is necessary, these common words were not originally  
designed for such heavy duty use.

Nonsense. Your decision to pick B made you unhappy, but A would have made 
you even more unhappy.
                    

        >To you, meaning is value.  


Not so. The soap operas on TV have meaning to me, but they have zero value  
to me.
                    

        >I've decided that emotions assigning positive value to things is 
        >not conducive to reaching Singularity.       
  

Rather than debate the validity of your deduction again, I have a more  
fundamental question. Without bringing up emotion or your own personal  
opinion about the value of things, can you tell me why you "want" to reach 
the Singularity? I can't.

I've told you exactly what I mean by "subjective value", but after all this 
time you still haven't told me what you mean by "intrinsic value". 
Just give me a definition, its yours so you can make it anything you want,  
I won't argue with it, provided it's clear and not circular. If you can't do 
that at least give me a hint about what you're talking about.

I feel a need to either argue or clarify this point. Value is intrinisic
to meaning. Something without value is meaningless, and there is nothing
meaningful without value. You say that soap operas on TV have meaning to
you, but zero value to you. My argument is, if you did not value soap
operas then you would not expend the energy necessary to give them
meaning. We ignore what we do not value. Its a natural part of our
perceptual process. If I do not value a noise in the room I am in, then
it becomes ambient, attentuated, and I thus expend little to no energy
on percieving it. If I do not value a persons opinion or the prospect of
debating it, then I will ignore them entirely. I am not going to waist
energy on them. I think the difficulty here is that we often only think
of value in positive terms, but our values create a continuum from good
to bad, like to dislike. Your value for soap operas is perhaps very low,
but you do value them, or the thought of them would not ever cross your
mind. You certainly would not correlate meaning with them if you did not
value them to some degree.

The only things we do not associate value with are those things which we
are indifferent to. As soon as anything catches our focus and interest,
we begin to dynamically associate value and meaning with it. This
includes things which we find repulsive or threatening.

Buddhists are particularly apt at indifference. Their religion requires
that they overcome the "illusion" of value and meaning [because "life is
suffering"] so that they can cease to re-incarnate.

Existentialists are also so apt. Except they have taken it beyond
Buddhism to the point where there is not even meaning in the lack of
meaning. Existentialism taken to the extreme becomes paralysis. If posed
with the question, "To be or not to be?", an existentialist cannot
answer either way, because neither matters, and thus both are
meaningless. Few people remain existential for very long, and fewer yet
claim they ever were. Most people realize how futile it is to attempt to
live without value or meaning. So from the existential realization that
their is no intrinsic meaning or value in life, an existentialist will
usually come to the conclusion that it is their responsiblity to create
value and thus meaning.

Something is only as meaningful as we appreciate it. Life is meaningless
when we are incapable of appreciating it. To the degree that we can
appreciate things is to the degree in which we can create meaning.

The depth of our ability to appreciate also mirrors the depth to which
we are able to create meaning. If a person is only able to appreciate
things as either weak or strong, that person is not going to be capable
of creating much meaning about things. We would consider this person
shallow. They are not employing a significant number of ways to judge
the value of something. However, a person who can percieve things as
weak and strong, ugly and beautiful, and worthy and worthless will be
able to create that much more meaning for things. A person who can then
take these dichotomies and differentiate finer and finer transitions
between them will be still more capable of creating a refined sense of
meaning for something. We might call the latter person a connoisseur.   

For me, ecstasy qua self-epiphany is "The meaning [and purpose] of
Life", it is the climax of being. It is for the sole purpose of
achieving novel, more complex, and more subtle forms of ecstasy that I
wish to attain immortality. However, if I did not value myself and how I
can make myself feel, then It would be meaningless for me to seek
immortality. Ecstasy, my self, and Life would be meaningless to me
without pleasure, my most primal sense for determing value.

I think the cruicial word here is 'point' - the place has to be defined 
quite strictly, otherwise it will be useless. So the Schelling points 
will lie at the points defined by space geography or obvious interest - 
near rare and unique astronomical objects, or at places which for one 
reason or another are "pointed" out by their surroundings, like maybe the 
center of the rosette nebula. Planetary neubulas might work quite well 
as neighborhood points.

The next step is to make it clear where to go in the center. As Greg Bear 
eloquently describes in his novels, the center is a huge place with room 
for much wonder. You might want to set up some lighthouse or other sign 
to make beings gather.

Ed Regis's GREAT MAMBO CHICKEN.

Keith Henson - whose youthful fun, with his wife Carolyn, was Recreational
Explosives (sound familiar?) - is planning the Far Edge Party.  In 200,000
years, he and his many-copy selves and their friends will meet at the other
edge of the galaxy and swap notes.  If the party gets big enough, the bean
dip will form a black hole, the Bean Dip Catastrophe.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

 I just read a piece in my favorite periodical - "Breakthrough!" on
"MIPsucking" - a method of using Java scripts embedded in Web pages that
is, in Sean Morgan's words, "technically capable of transforming a Web
site into a massively parallel meta-supercomputer that draws on the unused
cycles of visiting machines". 

 Maybe, this can also be used as a model of user's payment for content.
Currently, the advertisement model is:

 - the site collects a pool of ads and distributes them to the visiting
machines.  The user pays for a page view with extra few seconds wait for
downloading the ad, smaller viewing space, and distraction.  The ad, as
always, works (gets clicked on) 1% to 5% of the time.  The advertisers
pay the site and then try to figure out how much use they got out of this.

 The MIPsucking model would be:

- the site collects a pool of computations to be performed and distributes
them to visiting machines. The user pays with unused machine cycles and
time to load the script. (The script load time can be made unnoticeable
as well, as the script, unlike the ad, can be downloaded *after* the
page load.)  No screen space, no user distraction, works 100% of the time
(with the exception of interrupted connections)  The companies who ordered
the computations would get immediate results - exactly what they paid for.

  The MIP payments may also be viewed as more "democratic" as they will
extract greater payments from more powerful users, while ad viewing is
more taxing for people with slower modems and smaller screens.

 Maybe, this technique will become the prevalent method of payment for
content browsing?  Or at least, the user would be able to specify, in
some browser option, the payment method: "ads, MIPs, microcash, other" ?

 I wonder what kinds of computations can be performed this way.

Oops, did I say Greg Bear? I meant Gregory Benford...

(Some spoilers ahead): The galactic center is the focus of a huge
conflict/competition between several phylums of beings, most notably the
Mechs (a metacivilization of robots and AI), the Organics (mainly
involving the Myriapodia (bionic insectoids) and humans (thinly spread
scavengers hiding from the Mechs)) and electromagnetic beings based on the
fields near the Eater, the central black hole. The reason everyone is
there seems to be the immense energies that can be gathered using
megaengineering from the Eater. In the surrounding interstellar clouds and
star clusters there is a rich interstellar ecology, involving statite
autotrops hovering above the central accretion disk, metallovores eating
the autotrops, odd creatures in the interstellar clouds and living
beanstalks. There is a lot of megaengineering going on, ranging from
orbital cities over dyson spheres to dismantling planets using cosmic
strings and space-time engineering. In the last book, it even turns out
that there are even more immense forces involved (a *very* odd form of
intelligence!) and there are mentions of engineering on the cosmic scale. 

The relevant books are _Great Sky River_, _Tides of Light_, _Furious Gulf_
and _Sailing Bright Eternity_ (there are apparently two or three books
before these, set 30,000 years before the galactic center saga). I 
recommend them, especially for the beautiful descriptions of the odd 
alien life and physics.

> In general, anything that could make the slightest claim to be intelligent,

There are some things about John's definition of free will which are unclear
to me.  First, would simple computer programs really be said to have free
will?

I think John's original definition referred to "beings" with free
will, and he explained that before asking whether a program had free
will we should first ask if it is a being, which I gather would
imply consciousness at a minimum.  Since simple computer programs
aren't conscious, then this would mean that they don't have free will.
(Perhaps John in the above meant a program which was relatively "simple"
for a conscious computer program, something which would be very complex
by our standards.)

I also am not clear on how to define what it means to make a prediction.
Suppose we ask a conscious program, "What will you do if X happens?"  The
program runs a simulation of itself where X happens, and comes up with
the result, which it reports (perhaps with a probabilistic component).

Now we might say that this is not an accurate prediction, because if X
then actually does happen, the program won't be in the state it thought
it was going to be in when it made the prediction, simply by virtue of
having made the prediction.  So when X then does happen, the program might
do something else.  This would illustrate the program's inability to predict
what it would do.

But I don't think this is fair to the program.  It was asked to predict
what it would do when X happened.  We should have asked it, "What will
you do if you are asked to predict what you will do when X happens, and
then X actually happens?"  In that case the computer could have accurately
predicted what it would do in these circumstances.

Now of course if X happens after the computer is asked _this_ question,
again it might do something different from the prediction.  But once
again the problem is not that the computer program is unpredictable
(to itself or anyone else), but rather that the question being asked
does not correspond to the circumstances.  We would have had to ask it,
"What will you do if you are asked to predict what will happen under the
circumstances where you predict what you will do when X happens, and then
X happens, and then after making that prediction, X actually happens?"

This is obviously an infinite regress.  But again I would not conclude
from this that the computer is unable to predict its future actions, but
rather that it is impossible to usefully word certain types of questions
about future actions to a program with a memory of the questions it
was asked.  If the wording is supposed to imply that the program had
never heard the question, then the circumstances being asked about are
never going to occur.

You could ask it this: "What would you do if X happens after your memory
has been reset to the state it was in before I asked this question?"
In that case the program could accurately and reliably predict its
behavior.  In principle, a person with access to an accurate neural-level
description of his brain could do so as well (although obviously the
memory resetting would be more difficult in that case).

Would people's ability to answer such questions imply that they don't
have free will?  Do we really want to rely on the fact that the memory of
questions changes the state of the system to show that it has free will?
To me this is a somewhat incidental characteristic of conscious (and many
unconscious) systems and does not seem fundamental enough to distinguish
which ones have free will.

What if the "Singularity" gets out of control and messes up Gaia?
I don't worry about it *too* much, but it's certainly a possibility.
I don't just mean technologically, I also mean politically, and in
the effects that the new technologies will have on the political
structure. With no more Cold War, there's no telling what bored
and powerful politicians will do. I would prefer to see at least
some Diaspora before anything much like what people have been
predicting for the "Singularity" gets going.

Also, what about the hundreds or thousands of Amor, Apollo, and
Aten objects that cross Earth's orbit? Or even better, a high energy
comet?  We are on the edge of being able to buy ourselves insurance
against the fate of the dinosaurs... I don't like keeping all my
eggs in just one basket.

Eliezer, you're being simply obtuse. There are several different
differences. A 386 cannot make love to you. A 386 cannot discuss
epistemology with you. A 386 can't compose anything half as good
as a Mozart piece, at least not yet. A 386 cannot send chills down
my spine the way Tori Amos can. Listing obvious observations about
the differences between human beings and toasters grows tiresome...
surely you are capable of observing on your own. Of course, you
will now come back at me and claim that these differences make no
difference, and you will be wrong. These differences perhaps make
no difference *to you*, but as I said, nihilism is not a philosophy,
nihilism is an emotional disorder. These things make a difference
to *me*.

When did I claim that something is not valuable if a 386 acts to
maximize it? You're putting words in my mouth. But there are certain
things (such as truth, beauty, justice, love, etc.) that human beings
often act towards maximizing, that you cannot (yet) program a simple von
neumann machine to maximize. When you show me a "simple von neumann
machine" programmed so as to maximize these things, I'll be happy to
recognize it as a person. Or perhaps not. Perhaps we'll have new
characteristic poorly-understood abstractions around which our society is
built by then. And again, you're divorcing values from valuers. These
things are valuable to *me*. I cannot make them valuable to you by means
of argument. That's what the fact-value dichotomy is about. If you want
to use the knife of reason to destroy your own values, that's your own
business.

How about I just avoid your company in the future? That's my usual

Who said anything about "the direct, pleasure-center sense"? This
is *not* what I'm talking about. Sometimes unpleasant things are
valuable, and sometimes pleasant things have negative utility.
Life's being worth living is not a *given*, it is not an answer to
a question which can be proved or demonstrated. Life's being worth
living is a consequence of action.  There's nothing sillier than
someone mooning around asking whether or not life is worth living,
when they could be going out and *making* their life worth living.
You're doing the usual silly thing that people who try to *prove*
free will instead of *choosing* free will do.

I made no such statement. I was a making a suggestion, and I didn't say
anything about "requiring"... I was merely talking about "making a
difference". You are oversimplifying my suggestion and cramming it into
some weird crystal-edged intellectual pigeonhole of yours again.

Yes, the standard distinction between persons and non-persons is
breaking down, and we're going to have come up with new heuristics for
making that distinction. What else is new? But the fact that we will
soon no longer be able to make the glib equation "person = human" has no
impact on the question of whether or not life can be worth living.

Not to me it doesn't. But please make up your own mind on this question.
I don't think there's any screaming need for consensus yet on this
particular issue. If some people want to treat present-day AI programs
as people, that doesn't bother me any. It's good practice for the

Do your own research, buddy. I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm
just trying to steer you away from suicide-talk, because I would be
pissed off at you if you killed yourself over some ridiculous
abstraction that you had set up in your brain in such a way that it had
a negative effect on your brain chemistry. These things do happen!
Abstractions make good tools and poor masters. The meaning of life is
either right at the tips of your nerves, in the experiences that you are
having right now, or it is not at all. You are scaring yourself with
ghosts. The talk you are talking is death-memes, information patterns
that get into people's heads and sometimes kill them. It's lemming talk
even worse than the most virulent Christian fundamentalist memes.
Perhaps you are just playing intellectual games, and you're not really
*feeling* the sadness that comes with such ridiculous beliefs as the
ones you are pretending to espouse. But I've felt it enough that I have
very little patience for these ideas, and if you don't like my lack of
patience, tough! Go tell it to Kurt Cobain.

Significant of what? What question is it, precisely, that I'm ducking
here? Besides, you don't even know what you mean by "the pleasure
centers". You are scaring yourself with a lot of voodoo talk, building
frightening theories about things that have not yet been scientifically
investigated with any good results. "The pleasure centers" could turn
out to have as much or as little meaning as phlogiston or caloric. If
you are sincerely interested in these precise questions, you should
take up empirical neuroscience research, instead of pretending to be
able to come up with answers by mere introspection like Descartes and
Leibniz. Answers to such questions come from laboratories, not from
mailing lists.

This presumes that the phrase "inherent value" means anything
independent of a particular valuer, which it does not! Value is a
relationship between the valuer and the valued.  And there are no
rules to tell you what it is. This is precisely what it means to
be free. You get to decide what is right and what is wrong: you
are free. Thou art God. If you mess things up for your cohorts,
they will mess things up for you, so you might want to choose to
refrain from force and fraud (I usually do).

You aren't going to get freedom from choice, no matter how much you
crave it. As the old Devo song goes, freedom of choice is what you've
got.

Such a declaration is a degradation and cheapening of yourself as a
valuer. It is a repudiation of your own freedom to create values. You
are free to act, to create, to enjoy, to love. If that's not enough for
you, perhaps you can find something more in a basement universe with
different laws of physics.

 >Your intuitive definition of "value" is "All pleasurable activities that

Not all valuable things are pleasurable, for starters. Perhaps you
are so confused because you have oversimplified here (hedonism is
always an oversimplification, although perhaps David Pearce did it
right this time). But I'm not espousing simple hedonism here. And I
don't have to justify myself to you, buddy. (Moral philosophy always
ends up in rudeness, it seems.)

Now you are begging the question that innate ability levels are
determined by your genes and not by your first-five-years environment,
which is precisely the claim that I was attacking!

Last time I checked this stuff out, I became fond of M87. It's the
largest known galaxy in the Virgo Supercluster, it's fairly close
to the center of gravity of the Virgo Supercluster, and it has a
monstrous jet of energy squirting out of it which would be fun to
investigate, and might be quite useful for high-energy physics
experiments, etc. (The Local Group of galaxies hangs out on the
edge of the Virgo Supercluster, for those of you who don't already
know.) One possible problem with M87 is that it is a giant elliptical,
and last time I looked into the astrophysics of galactic evolution,
there seemed to be reasons to believe that elliptical galaxies are not
as rich in the heavy elements (and might even be *carbon-poor*, horror
of horrors) as spiral galaxies. So perhaps M100 instead?

More recently, though, I've entered a more practical-minded phase,
so I spend a lot more time thinking about carbonaceous chondrites
(and short-period comets) in Earth-approaching orbits. 2100 Ra-Shalom
and so forth. I will be watching the NEAR mission to 433 Eros with
great interest: it will be interesting following a mission that's
being run from Johns Hopkins in Maryland and not from JPL in
Pasadena. The spirit of Clementine lives on! Speaking of Schelling
points, where can I find a list of known near-Earth objects ranked
by roundtrip delta-vee from Earth? I'm having trouble finding
references and my celestial mechanics is still inadequate to make
the task of calculating delta-vees WRT Earth from the raw orbital
elements anything but daunting. But I'm working on it. I should just
give in and get a copy of Dance of the Planets, I know.

I'd rather charge nanocash for both bandwidth and computation resources. 
Consider a grassroot infrastructure of locally linked (optically) micro 
nodes, several nodes in a household, local wiring 
north/south/east/west/up/down, and then some more (hypergrid/random local 
wiring). Both the hardware and the wiring DIY, of course. People let 
things route through/run on your node, you charge them for that. In 
turn, they charge you for use of their resources. Not the least of this 
infrastructure's uses will be digicash capability. Charging per 
packet volume/ops will create a powerful vector towards cheaper 
resources and/or higher bandwidth.

Hi, it seems there is a little confusion going on over the exact definition
of "meaning" here (a broad term, as with most high-level concept words in
English).  "Meaning" can refer to information content (the "meaning" of the
book) or it can refer to purpose (the "meaning" of a religion).  

Obviously soap operas have meaning in the sense of information content, but
to most of the members of this list, little or no meaning in the sense of
purpose.  The sense of meaning in this discussion (the Meaning of Life)
obviously is the purpose one and "meaning is value" should be pretty
accurate.

But justification must follow from premises, which cannot be derived
logically.  In humans the premises come from the heart.  You're just saying
you analyze your premises more carefully than most people, who run about with
self-contradictory premises because they let their "heart decide" (i.e., just
accept what premise it coughs up that day).  This is very sensible, but it
doesn't mean that your base goals are derived logically, only that you apply
logic aggressively and constently to achieve your goals.

I did word that badly.  Yes, a complex enough organization can behave
as if it has "will"; we ourselves are such organizations, and when we
collect enough of us with diverse drives to work collectively, the
results of those interactions can appear willful.  What I object to is
the assignment of "rights" to this organization, because history shows
me that doing so is always detrimental to the individuals--all of them.
Because physical resources are limited, they must be allocated.  To
allocate some to "society" requires taking them from individuals.  If
doing so was a positive value to some individuals, they would willingly
do so--the fine tradition of private charity bears this out.  But
democratic policies take those resources by force, and therefore by
definition are unaccountable for their use.  

> How have you been compassionate recently as an individual? 

I, and all libertarians I know, are very compassionate people.  I
take care of my friends and family, I support charities (only private
ones), I have done volunteer work, and I perform the single, most
fundamentally moral, socially responsible act there is: I earn an
honest living, by voluntary contract.  I do not steal from others,
either by robbery of by vote.

They will be fabulously wealthy by today's standards, just as the poorest
Americans today are wealthy by their ancestors' standards.  They will
enjoy the benefits of all the technology produced by those elites, and
they will probably continue to complain about the injustice of the system
that created them, and continue to fight it with pretty words like
"equality" and "democracy", while continuing to enact policies that result
in the exact opposite results.

You can't have value without meaning, but you can have meaning without value. 
If it were otherwise then "value" and "meaning" would be synonyms. 
They're not.

Haven't you ever been suckered into going to a very boring speech of zero 
value where somebody is explaining in excruciating detail something that you  
already know?
                 

        >there is nothing meaningful without value. 


Is everything that you understand of equal value to you? It certainly isn't 
with me.
                     

        >We ignore what we do not value. 


I wish that were true but the mental mechanism that extracts meaning is not 
always under conscious control and works even when we don't want it to. 
If you're trying to concentrate on something you think is important, it is 
not at all helpful to be near two people having a loud conversation about the 
relative merits of opening an egg at the big end as opposed to the small end.

                     
        >Its a natural part of our perceptual process. 


Evolution realized that total concentration was not conducive to survival. 
If all of your brain power is being used to try to figure out the meaning of 
life, then you won't notice the saber toothed tiger lurking in the bushes. 
Conditions change however, inside my own home I'd be willing to take my 
chances with saber toothed tigers in exchange for total concentration.

Much more difficult if the noise is a language you understand. I have a 
recording of the sound of rain I sometimes use, the white noise masks more 
obtrusive noise, my mind knows it's the sound of rain and does not try to 
extract any more meaning out of it and let's me concentrate.


        >our values create a continuum from good to bad, like to dislike. 
                     

Yes, and our understanding of something also forms a continuum from zero to 
total, but the only relationship between the two is that if understanding 
is zero then value is zero.

1)I understand that mass causes spacetime to curve. 
2)I understand that Bozo the clown has a red nose.

My understanding of #2 is very deep and there is little if anything about it  
that eludes me. My understanding of #1 is not as deep and there are things 
about it nobody comprehends, yet I value idea #1 far, far, more than #2.

It's simply a matter of perspective. One of the tricks I played when I

the cover has such an unpleasant image on it.

Nice post, but I feel I have to correct you a little on this one point. 
The illusion Buddhists overcome is the illusion of *intrinsic* meaning
and value, not meaning and value as such.  

In other words, the cause of suffering, according to Buddhism, is our
habitual reification of meaning and value as inherent in the object
(self or other) in itself.

Buddhist philosophers have through the centuries striven to make this
distinction clear.  To see meaning and value as illusory in *every* sense
would be nihilism, which is the opposite extreme to reification (which
they call eternalism), but Buddhism is notoriously the 'Middle Way'.

Just as people who are familiar only with the teachings of the
Catholic Church should refrain from making generalizations about
all of Christianity, so people who are familiar only with the
teachings of Theravada Buddhism should refrain from making
generalizations about all of Buddhist dharma. The boddhisattva
ideal is an immortalist ideal, seeking permanent reincarnation
until all of existence has been made conscious and achieved the
ecstasy of enlightenment (which is, according to Mahayana teachings,
not a final space in which one "arrives", but capable of boundless
expansion and self-transformation). I happen to think the Four Vows
of Mahayana Buddhism are entirely compatible with extropian values,
but that's just my personal opinion.

Furthermore, the emotional state which Mahayana Buddhists generally
develop as their central mood can better be described as "detached
compassion" than as "indifference". Zen Buddhism is rather Apollonian
in this way, and I do like some of the Dionysiac stuff that is
mostly missing from it, but I think your criticism of the Apollonian
aspects goes a little too far.

There is a lot of confusion of terms in this "Meaning of Life"
thread, but there is also some interesting thought in it, so I
think it's worth trying to nail down a little.

One source of confusion: Design vs. Use.  Complex systems, whether
designed by human intention or evolution (not necessarily assuming
yet that they are distinct), are designed for a "purpose" in the
sense that there is a use or set of uses that caused them to come
into being (or remain alive, in the case of evolution).  A human
designer created a wrench for the purpose of turning bolts.  Humans
and other life forms alive today are alive because the effects our
genes had on the world caused them to replicate those genes more
successfully than others, so one can speak of the genes having
"designed" us for replicating them.

But once designed, a thing is what it is, not what it was "meant"
to be.  The designer's job is done, and the user can now choose to
respect or ignore the design.  A wrench is rigid and heavy because
that makes it better at its designed function of turning bolts, but
those features also make it well-suiting to cracking walnuts.

Congnitive and computational sytems are no different: assembly
language programmers know the trick of using a subroutine-return
instruction to implement a jump table by pushing an address from
the table on the stack and executing the return.  The instruction
was "designed" for returning from subroutines, but having been
desigined, it now does what it does, not only what it was meant
to do, so there is no reason not to use it for making jump tables.

Studying evolutionary biology is useful in understanding what the
brain does by using its design to guide our research; but it would
be as foolish to constrain our actions by that design as it would
be to let walnuts rot when there's a perfectly good wrench around.

This causes confusion because the question "What's our purpose?"
means at least two completely different things: one is "For what
purpose or purposes were we designed?".  Another is "Given the
results of that design (i.e., our abilities and the state of the
world as it exists today), what purpose or purposes would it be
most rational for me to pursue?"

I think evolution answers this first question adequately, until
some competing theory betters it.  But I also think it is of small
use in answering the second.  It may suggest what processes will
shape the future in which we act, and it helps us understand our
abilities, but it offers no guidance for our choice of goals.

I think, for example, that Eli is confusing "personal values"
with those things we are /designed/ to value, such as reproduction.
Given that definition, he is right to treat it as something that
is not necessarily a /useful/ value in the teleological sense.
What he calls "intrinsic" values are those values that can be
rationally shown to support his given goal (that goal itself may
or may not be rationally derivable).

I think what Eric means by the assertion that values are personal
is something else.  Namely, that given a goal, actions and the
products of those actions can be rationally shown to support that
gaol to varying degrees based on how well they use resources to
support the goal.  But each individual has different resources,
different capabilities.  Even if the goal is agreed upon, different
people will have different values that support that goal: if the
goal, for example, is wealth, then I would quite rationally value
my legs less than, say, Jerry Rice, because I am a programmer.  If
I came to work tomorrow in a wheelchair, my ability to earn wealth
would be affected little.  If Jerry Rice did, his income would be
affected drastically.  It is also the case that people differ in
their ability to reason and choose goals, but that is not necessary
to make values personal.  It still might be that there is a single
rational goal for humans to pursue, and therefore a single rational
"intrinsic" value system for each individual to have in support of
that goal, but its intrinsic nature makes it no less personal.

My idea had been that there's always someone who likes organizing these

Build a Dyson radio[1] to get everyone's attention, and possibly shunt

[2] I think gravity-tethered solar sails should work.  Huge sails at the
height where they're supported by radiation, and inflecting most of the
light back around (not at) the star.  Photons go one way, something has
to go the other, and if the sails can be kept stable over the star, both
star and sail should slowly glide off.

SGI's new workstation, Octane, pioneers a 7x7 crossbar switch, each link 
a measly 1.6 Gbit. Furthermore, it boasts one or two MIPS R10000 (175 or 
195 MHz), 4x high-speed XIO slots, autosensing 10BaseT/100BaseTX 
ethernet, 64 or 128 MByte RAM (up to 2GBytes), 1x par, 2x ser, ultra SCSI 
40 MBytes/s, one external ultra SCSI port, stereo I/O, loudspeaker, 
uphone, keyboard, mouse, 20" CRT and 3 gfx options. Float performance is 
70% above Indigo2-Impact-10000 family. Low-end version 25k$, high-end 34 
k$. Well...

TI's new superDSP TMS320C6x is soon out. According to TI, DSP market will 
grow from 2.3 G$ in 1996 to >8 G$ by 2000, whereas x86 zombie will 
"only" double from current 17 G$. Hence TI has abandoned its x86 clone 
project.

The wonder DSP runs at 0.2 GHz, boasts 8 parallel VLIW units (2 
load/store, two multipliers, four units for integer ALU and jumps. As in 
MMX, the maths can work with saturation. Each unit has a 1 OPs/clock 
throughput, claiming 1.6 GOPs top numbers (TI says 1.2 is realistic). The 
CPU has 32 x 32 bit registers in two files, but only 16 multiplication. 
It has 128 kByte RAM, also usable as cache. Also there is a 
SDRAM/SRAM/SBSRAM interface, two DMA channels, two timers, two serial 
lines and a 16 bit host access port. The core (sans RAM) is just 0.55 
MTransistors big. TI has an optimizing C++ compiler developed, offering 
about 60%hand-crafted assembly efficiency. The architecture (dubbed 
VeliciTI) is FLIW (flexible Long Instruction Word), a variable-length 
word architecture (1-8 parallelly executed ops). C6x can serve 15 V.34 
channels simultaneously/can do a 1024-integer-coefficient-FFT in 70 us. It 
will be available in the second quarter of 1997 for $96 (25 kpcs quantity).

LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

There has been a lot of discussion going on over in the "Church of
Virus" mailing list about the "Level 2" and "Level 3" of consciousness
that I describe in Virus of the Mind. The discussion has taken on a
comedy-drama of its own, with various participants claiming they are
not, in fact, real people, but rather characters being played by each
other. But questions keep coming up about what is meant by Level 3.

To backpedal a bit, Level 1 of consciousness is instinctual and
animalistic. Level-1 operators do not live by conscious philosophy.
Abstractions such as economics and physics are foreign to them. They
live with the hand they were dealt, not making much use of learned
philosophy.

Level 2, where most educated people operate, makes use of conceptual
tools to map out life and plan results for the future. Religions, the
scientific method, and all academic learning are examples of Level-2
structures. In Level 2, one's picture of the world gets clearer and
clearer. Often people will not break through to Level 3 unless and until
they have a life experience that invalidates and shatters their world
view.

Level 3 is characterized by the ability to flex your meme-space on the
fly; to use multiple models depending upon your purpose and priorities.
It's possible to gain an intellectual understanding of what this means
from Level 2, but probably not possible to really feel the impact of the
difference in life experience. The Level-3 mind has a great capacity to
hold dissonant, contradictory beliefs. (Einstein was said to have this
ability.)

SCC> No, really. 'Attractive' doesn't mean anything unless you have
SCC> a 'to whom' in mind.

That's true, but "to humans" is a specific, meaningful, useful answer.
We are not yet bush robots or utility fogs or bit patterns whose
wills are unconstrained by our physical nature.  Even if we did upload
our cognitive facilities /as they are/ into such a mechanism, the
values and drives pre-coded into the system are those that evolution
as a biological organism put there, and "attraction" is one of the
strongest pre-coded drives, because sexual selection drives evolution
faster than many other influences.

In my purely rational moments, I may conclude that spending time and
money on clothing is a waste of my resources, and I should therefore
spend my life in plain muslin robes that I might devote more time to
loftier pursuits.  Perhaps there exist women with whom I might share
a fulfilling relationship who would be attracted to an unshaven man
in a plain robe, but I'm not putting bets on it.  I am more likely to
meet interesting women if I dress in a way that women, by their nature
as evolved primates, are more likely to find attractive. 

I might wish to decry the injustice of it, complaining that I have to
buy $40 shirts and spend time ironing them; just as some women may
complain about having to make themselves up to appear more youthful.
But personally, it is less effort for me to take advantage of the
world as it is than to try to change what we do not yet have the
technology to change.  When it comes, sign me up.  Until then, I've
got dry cleaning to pick up.

Tom:
> What...constitutes a universal Schelling point?
>
> I offer a tentative answer:...the galactic center.

The classic example, as Tom mentioned, is where to meet in Paris if
no prior agreement was made.  As potential tourists, we tend to find
the answer of the Eiffel tower satisfactory.
However, if we were artists, and in Europe to visit art museums, 
we might choose the Louvre.

Given just a slight variation on the character of the participants,
a different answer seems quite reasonable.  A larger variation, to
a methane-breathing BEM, makes almost anything seem reasonable, as
long as it is important to the BEM.  He may find the discharge pipe
from Paris' nuclear power plant particularly facinating.

However, the one constant that sticks out in all of these is uniqueness.

Try the previous examples with multiplicity: if Eiffel had built two
similar towers, which one do you choose?  If the Uffizi were also in
Paris?  If Paris has two nuclear power plants?  None of them work anymore.

The BEM's view of the world may be terribly different from ours, but
I'll wager that he can distiquish 'one' from 'many'.  (He has to
be able to, if he can handle the concept of a Schelling point.)
Thus he can reach the same conclusion about uniqueness that we can.

With this in mind, Tom's suggestion of the galactic center may not
be facetious.  The center may be impractical if there is a big black
hole there, but it is unique.

While it is not clear to me if the entire discussion is about physical
locations or points on the radio frequency spectrum, the classic
'waterhole' does not appear unique.  It is one of many frequencies that
has good penetration characteristics.  It may seem natural to us water
based critters, but a hydroxyl group may be arcane chemistry to the BEM.

There is not only the 'what frequency' question, but 'where do we
aim the antenna.'

The fastest solution may be to solve the FTL problem ( or at least
fast sublight ), send a transmitter to the galactic center or other 
unique galactic feature, and broadcast from there.

Perhaps the most expedient way to do that is with a personal web page?
After all, it is not the physical appearance of the brain that one is
interested in, and if it were, that's easy to fake.  One's body of
written work (or artwork, or invention) is hard to fake--in fact it's
possible to verify with crypto-signatures, and gives direct insight
into the mental processes that created them.  It could easily become
a standard of social activity to exchange URLs instead of phone numbers.

If you'll excuse me, I'd better go update my site now...

Pulsars each have their own frequency, so each is unique.

ALso: A convention center orbiting the Cygnus X binary system.

A more nearterm convention spot: Copernicus Crater, 2006, as was
previously discussed on the >H list last year....

Since the universe is theoretically circular, i.e. if you travel in a
straight line you eventually return to where you started, then our
universal "center" is right here, which would also fit, since its all
relative anyways, a convention of trans and post humans would be at the
center of their diaspora, Earth.

Now considering that inside a black hole, the gravitational forces are
so great that the gravity of the rest of the universe is infinitesimally
small, that couls also be the closest thing to a "center" of the
universe, even though the inside is supposedly no longer part of this
universe....hmmmmmm. Possibly Cygnus X would have a hall for virtual
beings just above the event horizon, which would be the closest you
could get without actually leaving the universe. Funny, the point
closest to the "edge" of the universe is also closest to its "center".

No but I would say that the event horizon would be the universal meeting
point, as it allows extreme time dilation, allowing the inhabitants to
live to the end of the universe, and possibly through to the next one if
it eventually collapses, or to all travel into the next universe through
the hole that may be created by the singularity they are orbiting. In
this case, One would have to seek out black holes that have beacons
orbiting them to invite passerby to join the party. Also, given this
theory, might radio astronomers find advanced civilizations broadcasting
from blackholes at extremely low (i.e. redshifted) frequencies? Perhaps
we need to find black holes that are far enough away or large enough to
have quiet natural EM bands redshifted to be in synch with those bands
that penetrate an oxygen atmosphere? Pehaps with unusual EM bands?

I had a new (to me) idea about this old puzzle.

For people who have not run into it, the humongous (slang for huge) lookup
table is a device which should be able to pass the Turing test, while being
simple enough in design that it is hard to understand how it could be
conscious.  It is often presented as a challenge to the validity of the
Turing test.

As I understand the HLT concept, it would be a table which is indexed by
"the conversation so far" and produces "the next response".  You could
create an HLT by running all possible conversations through a conscious
computer program and recording its output for each conversation.  (We will
ignore the practical impossibility of running so many simulations.)
The resulting table would be truly humongous, since the number of possible
conversations is astronomically large.

Once the table is created, though, it is easy to use, a simple matter of a
single lookup per response.  You can sit down and converse with the table,
and have an intelligent conversation with this seemingly mindless device.

My idea is to suggest that you're not "really" conversing with the table.
I have an electronic device on my desk, smaller than a shoebox, with which
I can have an intelligent conversation.  It converses in natural English
and easily passes the Turing test.  It is my telephone.

The telephone isn't a challenge to the Turing test because we know that
we're not really talking with the telephone.  We're talking with the
person on the other end of the line.  The telephone is just a conduit,
a channel, to the person we're really talking to.

I think that the HLT can be thought of in the same way.  It is a conduit
to the person or program which was used to create the HLT.  When we talk
to the HLT, we're really talking to that program.

This is a little different from the telephone because the HLT is in
effect a channel into the past.  The reactions which the program had to
our conversation, and which were recorded as its reactions in the HLT,
have already occured when we talk.  Still, the mental picture I form of
the person I am talking to is real.  It doesn't exist now, but it did
exist in the past, just in the form I am imagining it.  So I think this
justifies thinking of the HLT as being just a channel between that mind
and my own.

In this light, the HLT is not really a challenge to the Turing test because
we're not really talking to the HLT at all.  The HLT attracts our attention
so that we forget about the program which was used to create it.  That is
where the mind actually is.

A few months ago I got a one on one presentation from a neuroscientist
(Dr. M. Kubek, Indiana U. Med. Center, Indianaoplis) 
working down the hall from my work-study job.  
Here's a brief version of then peek he gave 
me of 
his successes with inhibiting seizures in rats.  It just dawned on me 
today that his technique could be modified to give a constant, 
consistant, and localized dose of, say, dopamine or {insert favorite 
nootropic chemical}. 

The brains of a group of rats were conditioned to have siezures at the
prompting of a specific stimulus.  After conditioning, a portion of those 
rats had a "micro disc" (I believe that's what he called it) implanted in 
their brains at a site known to be envolved in a particular kind of 
siezure.  This micro disc is a small soluble, ...um... thing, that 
releases a chemical that naturally occurs in human 
brains as well as rats.  This chemical is known to inhibit siezures in 
both rats and humans.  When exposed to the stimulus, the rats without the 
micro disc showed no change in their response to the stimulus, while 
those with the implant showed a clear decline in brain activity 
associated with siezures.  
	I'm sorry about the missing details and any slight 
misrepresentaions of exactly what the experiment entailed, but the result 
of the experiment is clear; The microdisc Dr. Kubek used in this 
experiment delivers a constant, consistant supply of chemical to a 
localized region of the brain.  He went on to explain that humans with 
severe forms of epilepsy could have a permanent window in the skull 
through which a new micro disc could be installed on an out patient basis 
every few months or so when the previous disc had disolved.  This is an 
alternative treatment to i.v. injenctions, or in some cases, a 
frontal lobotomy.
	Such a drug delivery system could be used for extropic purposes 
(and, of cours, involuntary mind control), however drilling a hole in a 
perfectly good skull is not something I'd just jump into.  If the above 
method is not suitable, maybe it can be a starting point for one that is.
	This work is not yet published, though it was presented to a 
neuroscience conference in Washington D.C. around Nov. '96.  I'd be 
willing to find out when and where it will be published for an interested 
party.

	Please pardon any awkward sentences.  Pine does not allow me much 
latitude for editing.

Exovivo!

Thank you for understanding my core point, and what a wonderful 
transhumanist suggestion!  You could add interaction on e-lists as 
another way to use one's brain to attract people--plenty of sexy minds 
on this one!  

I also agree with your comments on clothing, although for slightly 
different reasons.  Clothing conveys information to other persons, 
but it can also become a part of the physical experience, with the use 
of different textures and shapes and colors.  We indulge our tactile 
and artistic senses through choice of fabric and style, and show 
others our individuality.  It is the easiest (and least messy) method 
of altering our physical structures for business or pleasure modes.

Combining a sense of physical style with a roving intelligence 
produces a forward aesthetic and a truly magnetic combination 
to lure potential lovers.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

 Given present search engines on the net, it should be rather a simple
step to add in a contextual/grammatical comparator. Using a database the
size of the net, maybe even just recording all email or usenet traffic
for a few months to create the database, such an engine could enter in
text read from a person, look up contextually and grammatically relevant
material, as well as with a thesaurus to vary the use of words to
prevent redundancy, and pass as an AI rather handily. Would a 128 bit
search engine be able to do this?

Well, it's time for me to wrap this thread up.

Eric Watt Forste is (sorry!) becoming almost eerily similar to Searle at
this point - evasive, refusing to answer direct questions, making fun of
(and misinterpreting) the opposing position, and always claiming that
the answers are obvious.  I am sure you'd get a similar answer if you
asked Searle what the hell "causal powers" are, why they don't exert any
detectable influence on our neurons, and if so, how Searle found out
about them.  "Causal powers are there, and to say they aren't, is a
disorder of the affects.  Breathe in the fresh air.  How can you say you
don't have causal powers?"

John K Clark's argument is harder to grasp and counter, but I can still
try.  There's joy in life, and then there's blind joy in life.  I enjoy
Bach, but I am not afraid to question the value of my enjoyment.

Is the Meaning of Life *really* 42?  Why should the Meaning of Life be
"survival" if the survival goal has genetic default value +42, and
"death" if the same goal has a value of -42?  I refuse to give one
arbitrary number such power over my life!

Simple arbitrary things aren't answers, they're evasive actions.  I
don't believe in Searle's "causal powers".  They're too arbitrary.  I
don't believe in Chalmers's irreducible qualia.  They're too simple. 
Take your flowchart for "consciousness", John K Clark, and apply it to
"value"!

Am I out of contact with my emotions?  Not at all.
In fact, I am a True Zen Master <tm>.

Observe this [true] koan:

Eliezer was explaining the Meaning of Life to a novice.
"Really," he said, "I know the Meaning of Life."

"What is it?" asked the novice, who was skeptical.

"It is -" began Eliezer, but suddenly sneezed.

And the novice was enlightened.  In fact, she was enlightened so hard
she had trouble breathing.  And thus Eliezer knew he was a True Zen
Master.

Actually I think it would imply consciousness at a maximum. I like my  
definition of free will, but I don't have a definition for consciousness 
that's worth a damn, even though I experience it. Also, unlike free will, 
I don't have a sure fire test for it, The Turing Test is the best anybody has 
come up with, it's not perfect but it's all we have. It's all we'll ever have 
I think.        


        >I also am not clear on how to define what it means to make a         
        >prediction.
                

I ask the computer program: "Suppose you decided to search for the 
smallest even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two primes  
(ignoring 1 and 2) and then stop. Would you ever stop?"

Not only will the computer program be unable to answer that question but 
I can't either, nobody can.

Yes, that is another problem. For the mind to totally understand itself it  
must form a perfect internal model of itself, but that is impossible because  
the brain as a whole must have more members than the part that is just the  
model.       

        >But I don't think this is fair to the program.  It was asked to         
        >predict what it would do when X happened.  
             

It's not important if an outside party asks us to make a prediction, because 
we constantly ask ourselves the question "What am I going to do next?". 
The answer we receive is often wrong, we change our mind and surprise 
ourselves, or the answer we receive is "I don't know I'll have to think about 
it". We know for sure what we're going to do when we do it, and not before.
             

        >You could ask it this: "What would you do if X happens after your         
        >memory has been reset to the state it was in before I asked this

        >predict its behavior. 
             

But it would still take the computer 10 minutes to figure out what it will do 
10 minutes from now. Besides, if its memory is erased what's the point?
                 

        >In principle, a person with access to an accurate neural-level

        >will? 
                 

The electronic computer is much faster than my old steam powered biological 
brain, so it figures out in 10 seconds what I'm going to do in 10 minutes, 
but if the computer then tells me of it's prediction about me, and my  
personality is such that out of pure meanness I always do the opposite of  
what somebody tells me to do, then the prediction is wrong.
              

        >Do we really want to rely on the fact that the memory of questions         
        >changes the state of the system to show that it has free will?
             

I think we do, because we're the one asking ourselves the questions.

If you enjoyed it then you've already answered the question, you are saying 
Bach has value to me. What do you care what my opinion is on the subject,  
or the opinion of the Universe if it has one, which I very much doubt. 
The Universe is dumb, that's why you're a better music critic than the

Excellent! That's exactly the right attitude. 42 may be the meaning of life 
to the universe but it sure as hell isn't for you or me, the universe can 
take 42 and all its meaning and stick it where the sun don't shine.

1) Is what Value does complex? If yes go to 2 if no explain how to reconcile 
   that with the way it effects our lives, both objective and subjective.

2) Is Value itself complex? If yes go to 3 if no then religious people are 
   right Science is not important and can not help us in the most important 
   questions.                 
   
3) Is Value made of parts? If yes go to 4 if no explain how something can          
   be complex yet have no structure.

4) Does the Value operate in an uncoordinated, incoherent manner?       
   If no go to 5 if yes explain how to reconcile that with experience, both          
   objective and subjective.

5) Do the parts communicate among themselves? If yes go to 6 if no explain          
   how coordination is possible without communication.

6) Is a part that changes in only one way (a bit) the simplest part of Value?   
   If yes go to 7 if no then something that does not change at all is the 
   essence of Value and religious people are right, Science is not important 
   and can not help us in the most important questions.           

7) Is Value information processing ? If yes then go to 8, if no then explain 
   what the difference is.                      

8) Is Value a state of mind? If yes then I'm right if no explain what the   
   difference is.

And this applies to survival.  If I stop valuing my survival, that goal
may not come up again.  In which case, I won't be around much longer
either.  Of course, one could have other goals, which justify valuing
survival because otherwise those won't get accomplished.

But yes, I can easily see us as machines set to fulfill some purpose.
We hold those values because that is what we are; our values are part of
our definition.  We're evolutionarily supposed to value our
reproduction; in fact, we're so complex that a fraction of us have
wandered off and developed new goals, like suriving no matter what, or
having fun, or exploring lots of place, or trying to learn all
knowledge, or realize some concept of a Singularity.  Take away those
goals, and you have a different machine, or a broken one which falls

to be a polymath meaningful?  It's what I am.  I could try to justify it
practically -- "knowledge is power, this is good for survival" -- but
that begs the question of survival, and isn't really accurate.  I like
to learn for its own sake.  I think I also value my survival, out of
stubboness.  So I have at least two independent goals, which happen to
support each other somewhat.  I can't a priori justify either.  It's not
that I haven't thought about it; I have, a fair bit.  I haven't gotten
anywhere, and neither has anyone else.  This doesn't bother me.  Those
it does bother can die of apathy, and leave the rest of us here.

Crosscheck James Rogers' fascinating revelation of a soon-to-come 
internet-thru-space infrastructure by a LEO sat fleet. Since our cities 
are not designed for stringing optical fibre effortlessly, launching 
sats is paradoxically cheaper. 
It's insane, but it's true. We must redesign our cities from

simply not happen. So gimme the LEO sats, and quick.

In my opinion, this is not (just) an ethical question, it's the logic of
believing in a laissez-faire system, where human social actions are
believed to be detrimental to 'a natural order'. My point was that giving
money to ones children, conflicts just as much with such a 'natural order'

I didn't intend anything so drastically, again i just want to point out the
fact that a system without 'guidance' works when relatively more money is
in the hands of those that are relaitvely more intelligent, who will make
better decisions as to what to consume. (in view of the consumer elite
discussed a few weeks ago on this list) And point out the problem that will
arise after X generations of rich people who didn't come in to that money
themselves. What decisions will they make in what products to buy ?, and
how will THEIR decisions influence the rest of humanity ? 

>You want socialized medicine and you call yourself an extropian? The FAQ
>says something about that.

On the brighter side, a large part of the stupid people would simply lose
all the money they had been given in no time anyway. Question is what
damage can they do to the system, in the time they take to lose that money ?

It all depends on how much the little social mobility such a system has,
will make up for this. I'm sure you're aware that the last few generations
aren't always 'doing a little better' anymore...

Sounds great! I would like to participate in the species design (hmm, 
they will definitely have a "meaning of life"). The rosette design would 
need to involve some stabilization systems, to keep it in shape (it is so 
embarassing with broken symmetries - but wait, wouldn't it make some 
spectacular fireworks if we made a few stars collide at the end?!).

For the sun, you have around 10^26 W to play with, I think it would 
definitely be intergalactically visible if you used a directed beam.

The trick is to get the gravitational coupling to work - otherwise you get
sails moving away from the star. Ideally the sails are heavy, just to drag
the star along. But I think we could use the energy to induce flares on
only one side instead or create a stellar laser, that ought to speed
things up.

According to my reference, the force per watt of radiation is about
3e-9 newtons.  This implies a total force if we could capture all
the light from the sun of about 3e17 newtons.  Divided by the mass of
the sun, 2e30 kg, gives an acceleration of 1.5e-13 meters per second.
If we wanted to move the sun one light year, accelerating for half that
time and decelerating for half, we'd have to accelerate it about 4.7e15
meters, twice.  d = 1/2 a t^2 so this gives us a t of 5e14 seconds for
the whole trip, or about 10,000,000 years.

So we will have to be patient to use this method.

I like the way you put this, Hal, and it seems correct to me. The lookup
table case has always been annoying since it's hard to grant it true
awareness. However, it never really bothered me too much since I'm a
functionalist not a behaviorist. The Turing Test assumes functionalism.

The importance of the lookup table example also seemed less important
because it is surely implausible to build a functional intelligence that
uses a look up table. As you note, the number of possible conversations is
too large. Still, citing the lookup table as possible *in principle* left
it as a bothersome example (on the assumption of behaviorism). I think your
explanation of what's going on with a table puts the example to rest.

Not True. We mean that if A exists then B will exist further along a sequence.

The universal conversational hash table is like the infinite library (a
library with all possible books).  If it could exist, it would be a weird
thing, but it's just not possible.  There are too many phrases to encode.  Do
you realize how long it would take to program 3^^^3 intelligent
conversational responses?

This is the most plausible way to create a hash table conversationalist and I
believe similar methods are used to create certain computerized support
systems.  However, it fails the Turing test quickly as once you say a
sentence nobody has spoken before, it will fail.  It's very easy to devise a
sentence with a vanishing probability of having been spoken before and
trivial to devise such a conversation.  Almost any innovative analogy will
do.

This is quoted from http://uhuru.net/tlksrc/9608/sources/teach13.htm,
which is just the first URL that popped up off of Altavista. I've seen
better translations, but without the context of the Mahayana Buddhist
tradition, none of the translations is going to make sense anyway.
Remember that although in English it sounds like New Age gibberish, in
the language that it's translated from, this stuff is technical jargon.

1. To take across the numberless living beings
2. To cut off the endless affliction
3. To study the countless Dharma doors
4. To realize the supreme Buddha Way

I will add a few comments, though it's rather blasphemous of me to
do so since I haven't taken these vows and thereby, by my own
standards, am not a Mahayana Buddhist. "Dharma doors" generally
seems to mean something like "aha" experiences or epiphanies, the
really big "aha" experiences apparently being satori.  My understanding
of these vows is that they represent the declaration of ambitions
that are impossible to fulfill, or that will take eternity to
fulfill. It seems to me that these are the right kinds of ambitions
to have if one is serious about living forever.  Also, "to take
across" is a technical term meaning to bring to full enlightenment;
since the vow specifies the numberless living beings and not just
the numberless sentient or sophontic beings, this could be interpreted
as a Brinesque call for universal Uplift (except Buddhists don't
necessarily oppose cryptography ;) or perhaps a Hansonian
saving-the-world.  In any case, it's obvious that a person taking
the above vows is not in any sense "stepping off" of any Wheels.

If there are any real Buddhists on the list, and I'm making a hash of
things here, please correct me. Thanks.

The Buddhists that I like best tend to keep quiet about their religion,
are good at having fun and appreciating stuff, tend to be studious, and
like to party. I think that Joko Beck is my current favorite Buddhist
writer, though the first thing any Zen book should tell you is that you
can't get Zen out of a book.

Once upon a time, religion was an off-limits topic on this list (because
of the Great Witch War). Perhaps we should invoke this rule on some of
Eliezer's posts.  ;)

I am not sure the lookup table business can be disposed of thus easily. 
If we consider the lookup table to define a discrete Hamiltonian over 
entire system state space, it obviously describes a physical system 
exhaustively, its entire dynamics. Since a human is a physical system, a 
lookup table can certainly describe his evolution. The answer lies in the 
size of the table -- it is superastronomic (not enough matter in the 
universe to construct anything interesting). That a lookup table 
intuitively cannot be intelligent is an artefact of our intuition, having 
about the same relevance as that against Searle's chinese room gedanken 
experiment, imo.

I love it, but it's a mondo, not a koan (some koans, like Joshu's "mu",
come wrapped in mondos).  I'd love to collect or create a good set of
modern American mondos and koans, because the traditional ones often
depend on the culture of old Zen patriarchs more than is necessary. 
Especially the traditions of Buddhism, that Zen really has nothing to
do with at its heart.

Here's an American koan for you: Tell me, what is you car's
destination, right now?

Yes, "solar sailing" is very slow business. Of course, in 10 million 
years you will most likely have another star within 1 ly, and you can use

On his web page, Robin advertises *saving the world*, in boldface, as
one of his ambitions. That's all I was referring to.

But how do you escape from the universe where you are now, into another?
According to the scenario you describe, other universes already exist,
you don't create them by starting to simulate them. So suppose you're
Trans-Anders, stuck in a collapsing universe where a Tiplerian Omega Point
won't happen, and you simulate a few timeslices from a Dyson universe in 
which Trans-Anders gets to expand boundlessly. At the end of the simulation,
you remain where you were; and your Other Self exists regardless of
whether you conduct your simulation or not.

Of the various schemes for literal immortality that I've heard of,
I'd rank the Linde scenario as the likeliest sounding, with Dyson
a close second, Tipler third, and Moravec/Egan fourth.

Would the table fail the test if it responded saying, "I do not
understand. Could you please rephrase your statement?" I personally do
not comprehend every obscure analogy that I hear either, and thus have
to respond in the the aforementioned fashion. Does this mean that I
would fail the Turing test? 

Imagine the computer is confronted with a statement which it has no
reply for. What if it were then to say, "I do not understand the
question. If I were asking you the same question, how would you reply?"
Once it was given a response it could then store the question and the
reply in its table. Thus the next time it was confronted with this
question it would have a response. There are certainly faults here, the
computer would of course be particularly gullible, recording any kind of
nonsense some one might offer it, but it still seems to me like a step
towards learning ... no matter how simplistic. To reduce its gullibility
or to increase its apparent intelligence, the computer might run some
simple checks on the reply similar to those we use in forms
verification, e.g., you ask for someone's email address and you have cgi
or javascript check to make sure there is an ampersand in the reply.
With a little thought, I'm sure this could get a bit more useful, but if
the computer came to the conclusion that it might be being "toyed" with,
it could respond, "Are you sure that is a valid response to your
question?" If the person replied "no", the computer could scrap the
whole thing, but if the person said "yes, it is", the computer could be
programmed to always accept it as if everyone was honest, or it might
determine by some other means, fuzzy logic perhaps, if it wants to risk
the chance of keeping the statement and reply within its table for
future use.

I'm not too thoroughly familiar with this ... so bash away.

Several of you have weighed in with thoughtful comments on this topic, and
I've enjoyed learning about how astrophysics might combine with game theory
to encourage mega-engineering projects--and *incredible* parties!

Several parties have mentioned that the relevant Schelling point(s) might lie
not in physical space but rather in the electromagnetic spectrum.  That makes
a lot a sense, on reflection.  Why cart our meat (or, more aptly, silicon) to
the party when we can simply attend at a distance, virtually?  Granted that C
would still hinder our repartee, but the same damned limit would also make
personal meetings extraordinarily burdensome.  (Sure, relativistic effects
would cut the apparent commute, but who wants to return to homebodies who've
aged at hugely disparate rates?)

Assuming that we seek electromagnetic Schelling points, would we really aim
at something (as I believe Michael Lorrey suggested) in the 21 cm band?  I'd
like to hear more of the reasoning behind that choice.  Doesn't it rely on a
rather parochial notion of appropriate biologies?  

Were I an alien trying to contact scattered friends, I think I'd set up a
sort of lighthouse that, at freakishly regular intervals, would blast out
discrete bursts of EM radiation.  Then I would, in between or next to the
bursts, plug in my message to the universe:  "Partyline in the 10 cm band!
 Just dial 1-900...."

Sounds kinda' like a pulsar, eh?  I wonder if anyone has listened closely to
the spaces *between* their signals.

Hmmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it would be next to
impossible to remove the topic of religion from any in depth discourse
involving science. Would you grant me that subjects of faith are the
property of religion? ... And that every science is based on precepts
which cannot be proven and thus must be accepted via faith alone? If so,
is religion not the foundation of science? It seems to me that religion
might be the buffer between science and the unknown. As science expands,
so does its religion. Perhaps if we replaced the word faith with
probability, it would all become science again, i.e., instead of saying,
"I have faith in this a priori precept", I might say, "It is probable
that this a priori precept is true." But then, by replacing the concept
of faith with that of probability, am I not merely ontotheologically
sublimating the concept of faith with a more evolved or refined concept
of the same? Is probability anything more than exalted faith? Just a
thought.

I don't see science so much as a departure from religion, but the
evolution of it. We still have similar goals such as immortality and
controlling the masses [doctrine and crusades vs. military weapons
technology]. It doesn't appear science has become much more mature than
religion ... though perhaps more refined, more sophisticated.

   The evolution of attaining what we need/desire:   
   primal need/desire --> religion --> philosophy --> science    

I have faith, or does it just seem probable to me, that there will be
something beyond science as well. Hard to imagine, but things always
move on. I bet the evolutionay path I so wonderfully typed above will
recursively come full circle ascending once again to a more
sophisticated level. This would mean the synergism of science [reason]
and emotion. Again, hard to imagine, but it might not hurt to think
about it. What ever it will be, it is inevitable (very probable) that
someone will make the next leap.  

E[PN/D] --> R --> P --> S --> E' --> R' --> P' --> S' --> E'' ... E^n

Perhaps my emotive bent hinders my cognitive reasoning. [fancy way of
saying I might be a flake.]

My $.02: the lookup table presents no problem if you regard passing
the Turing Test as a likely indication of consciousness or intelligence, 
but not as a defining criterion of intelligence.

Consider the "Thermometer Test" for the presence of heat. If you
stick a thermometer in an unknown liquid and the mercury shoots up
the column, you have reason to believe that the liquid is hot.
But "being hot" is not the same thing as "being disposed to cause 
mercury to expand", and there are other ways to make mercury rise.

In other words: why would anyone think that the Turing Test was
foolproof? If you really want to *know* whether an entity is a
person / is conscious / is intelligent - having first adequately
clarified your concept - you may just need to know something
about its implementation, as well as its behavior. (Actually,
I would have thought that a functionalist would agree on this
count, since functionalism cares about internal causation.)

A bit like what happens in _Permutation City_, but remember what Durham
did. If I was convinced of the validity of the "Egan gambit" (for example,
by trying out something like Durhams serial experiments during my life as
Trans-Anders) and platonic materialism, I would accept the "No Clone
Theorem" and say that as long as the emulation and I were identical, we
were the *same* (in an ontological sense) being (in addition, I have as
you already know a somewhat fluid view of 'self'), so terminating my
existence as Big Crunch-Anders in favor of an existence as Dyson-Anders
would not be a problem. Essentially this scenario mirrors the various
discussions about uploading and identity, and the answer depends on your
view of the relation between you and your identical copies.

IMHO we haven't any support yet for the Linde scenario except for the
black hole sensitivity; I would be more convinced about it if we knew baby
or basement universes did exist. Dyson is reasonable and much in
accordance to known physics, but requires a bit of an update to take
reversible computing into account. Tipler seems to be heading more for
metaphysics than physics, but his scenario may still be saved and
extended. Moravec/Egan is as yet untestable (except through the dynamite
headband method), but might become more reasonable once we are uploaded...

Extropians,  I think that Extropian memes are not well known in the
general populace.  It takes some time to explain extropy, the
singularity,  cryonics etc.  I tried to spread some Extropian memes
amongst a very Earth-centered electronic mailing list dedicated to the
American writer Edward Abbey who wrote books such as the MONKEY WRENCH
GANG which inspired environmental activist groups.

I got a mixture of responses.  Some expressed interest in Extropian
memes.  Others gave responses such as:  "the Extropians have only one
ideal: self-preservation , not very lofty".  Others view the Extropians
as "cyber bionic wanna bes" who dream of living out some sci-fi related
crap in an alternative future life".            These mundanes think
locally and not galactically.

I think that the problem is that there is a huge gap in most peoples minds
from the computers they are using to realising that that technology is
growing exponentially and what that will lead to.
As my job mostly is about talking to "the general populace" I am currently
developing a Website to fill that gap. (and the extropy transhuman
web-designguide i have suggested will also be avilable on it.) It will be
called "Forward" and will apear in a month or two.

        That is definately true, but it is not nearly an impasse.  There are
extropian-based programs that are doing a good job of dealing with this.
For starters, the Extropic Art Movement (EAM) is currently gaining a fair
amount of publicity.  Art in general is a good way of conveying complex
ideas in an unobtrusive and unthreatening manner.  The EAM, as the name
implies, is a movement based on art with extropianesque connotations.
When many people see this art, some will form a question into their minds
such as "I wonder what the purpose of *that* is?" or "I wonder what the
artist means?"  Once the question is there, people are generally open to
hear answers...and the idea is passed to friends.

        As well as this, there are quite a few seminars going on worldwide.
When you read some of Eugene Leitl's FYIs, you'll see that there are many
things happening throughout Europe etc.  Online magazines like Homo
Excelsior and Breakthrough! are getting hundreds per day.  In addition,
newsstand magazines such as Rage, Discovery, Time, Popular Science and Wired
have all at least touched upon some very extropian subjects...and that is
just extropy in general.  Libertarianism is also making a name for itself,
paralleling the more ethical and individual facets of extropy.

        So generally, a lot is happening, though it may be quite obscure.
More will be done to spread the ideals of extropy, but the steps must always
be precautionary: any badly done publicity could very well result in a
societal blacklisting for the philosophy...and that would be regress.

Explaining extropy by using the Singularity as a reference could have
resulted in the SF responses you received.  The same could have been true by
using cryonics.

Explaining extropy by using its philosophical implications and its
relationship to each individual could prove to be more of an eye-opener to
individuals who cannot grok the more far-sighted ideas of extropy. The
definition of extropy is clear.

Dealing with environmental activists can be tricky, but not impossible. I
view it as a challenge.  Before I became an extropian, although a
transhuman, indeed, I was an elected official for the Green Party (Council
person for the 27th senatorial district here in LA) I learned a bit about
the inside-thinking of environmentalists. Although I did not make a dent in
the overall thinking of this environmentalist contingency, I did wake up a
few folks to the future. An extropian can appropriately debate an
environmental point with solid and resourceful information.  It just takes a
bit of ingenuity. Greg Burch has some valid information on his Web site that
can be helpful.=20

>I got a mixture of responses.  Some expressed interest in Extropian

I'm assuming this is the cryonics associations.  No, its not our only ideal,
simply one of them. Take it as a challenge and back it up with quotes from
Max in his debate on the HotWired series.

>Others view the Extropians

Here is a great lead-in to bring up the most ardent advances in
biotechnology and how it manifests in everyone's life.=20

A proactive way of dealing with slurs of speech intended to provoke and
coming from a place of ignorance is to suggest reading material to your
opponent and back it up with accessible quotes from extropians who have been
published and who have a way with words.

Well, I'm a functionalist and I agree. For me, the Turing Test can only be
an indicator, as you say. It really doesn't contain any theory of
intelligence, except maybe of the kind "if it looks like a dog from the
outside then it is a dog" kind. The Turing Test was proposed in the days of
behaviorism. It may be the best we can do for now, but eventually we'll
have a convincing theory of intelligence and awareness.

I talked with Hans Moravec while we were at a conference at the beginning
of the month. He's taking his Platonic view further now. Not only does he
feel cryonics to be pointless, he now finds uploading pointless too. He now
believes that you can find a mind in *any* object (yes, that wall over
there, this coffee cup) with a sufficiently clever interpretation. That
interpretation may be too hard for us to discover so we may not converse
with that mind, but the mind nevertheless exists.

His Platonism ends up leading him into a position that, I believe, is
suicidal. Beware bad philosophy!

Once Mind Age appears, I'd like to write a rebuttal of his view. I'd hate
to see Moravec perish by taking distorted abstractions too seriously!

I understand why you would say this, but whenever I hear this view it makes
me choke! Confusing the boundaries of religion and science only plays into
the hands of those who want to maintain their irrational approaches to
thinking.

No, religion is definitely not the foundation of science, and faith has no
role in science. I do agree that, in a developmental sense, religion has
come before science. The progression: religion -- philosophy -- science
often is real. However, this does not make religion the *foundation* of
science. Certain concerns, such as the nature of the heavens, may start as
the province of religion since people have too little information and may
appeal to dogmas to decide what's up there. Once more systematic thinking
appears, philosophy may take over. Once philosophy has clarified the
problem and once more information is available (i.e. testable observations
become possible) the problem can enter the realm of science.

Yes, science at any point may involve suppositions or axioms or precepts
that are not proven. This is because nothing is *provable* in science, only
refutable. How is this different from faith? It differs in an extremely
important way: In a faith, the precepts may not be challenged. They are
fixed and absolute. In science (and in rationality in general), all
suppositions are open to challenge.

This is a version of that scenario that I could accept.  I don't remember
if this is exactly how it was done in the book, but it was something
like this.  I am an upload, so it is pretty easy to copy myself.
I make a copy which is intended to live for only a moment.  The copy is
distinguished from me in that it starts out in a world where there is
a sign saying "you are the copy".  It sees that for less than a second,
then it is instantly terminated.

It would take some courage for me to set up this situation, and some
people would be unwilling to do it.  The copy is going to *die*.
However since it will only have a fraction of a second of different
experiences from the other instance, not much is lost.  I have convinced
myself that when I run the experiment and push the button, if I see the
sign appear saying "you are the copy", I am willing to accept that my
existence will terminate a moment later, knowing that another version
of me will go on.  I'll squeeze my eyes shut, cringe, and wait for the
inevitable, knowing that it will be quick and painless.

According to the Moravec/Egan theory, when I run this experiment, if
I do find myself as the copy, I will not find my existence terminated.
After a few seconds, I will open my eyes disbelievingly.  The sign is
still there saying that I am the copy, but my program is still running.

Something has gone wrong.  Maybe there was a glitch in the program which
was supposed to terminate me, maybe the other instance of me changed
his mind at the last minute and cancelled the termination, maybe, as
in Egan's story, I learn that the whole thing was an insane fantasy and
now I can begin the long struggle back towards sanity.

What has happened is this.  There are an infinite number of possible
universes, but only a finite number of possible mental states for me.
That means that for any mental state, there are an infinite number of
instances of myself experiencing that state.  When something happens
which has a random component (as everything does), some of those instances
experience it one way and some experience it another.

If something happens to kill some of them, others will survive, because
although their mental states were the same, some other aspects of the
universe may have been different; or because the random event which
killed some did not happen that way in other universes.  No matter
what happens, some, an infinite number in fact, will survive.

It follows that everyone who has ever died in fact still lives.  To their
surprise, something happened which allowed their existence to continue.
I don't really know how the cavemen have managed to live for thousands of
years; maybe it turned out that aliens were watching them and swooped down
in the moment of death to rescue them, or maybe they were resurrected
out of a Tipler simulation.  Generally we can expect to witness the least
improbable event which allows us to stay alive.

This leads to the well known test of the theory, which is to try killing
yourself and see if it works.  But this has the drawback that if the
theory is wrong, you are dead.  That's why I like the uploading scenario,
since that is one circumstance in which I might be willing to try
experiencing death.

Of course, if I run the experiment and end up as the original, then I
don't know the answer.  I see the copy die.  Did it go on living in
some other universe?  There is no way to know.  I could run the experiment
multiple times, so that the chances that I will end up as the copy sometime
become larger (in some sense).  But there will always be an instance which
has never experienced being the copy, so it's not clear whether to think
of this as helping answer the question.

It's also worth noting that Everett's many-worlds interpretation of QM
makes roughly the same predictions, so you don't have to swallow all
the baggage of platonic materialism.  You can still hope that reports
of your death will be "greatly exaggerated."

I think the Extropic Art Movement can do a great deal to spread extropic
ideas. It's a different approach than the solely highly verbal and purely
analytical style in which extropian ideas have been presented so far.
("Solely" is important here, since I do not meant that extropic art
excludes this approach, it merely is not primary to it. In my view, art
*shows* rather than *explains*) If extropian ideas are to spread, several
approaches will be needed. Although extropian ideas may yet not be
widespread enough, I'm constantly amazed at how far they have spread in
such a short time. And that's just what is presented as explicitly
"extropian". Many many extropian ideas have become familiar on their own to
millions but not under the description "extropian".

One reason I haven't been posting much recently (until today) is that I'm
hard at work on my way of spreading extropian ideas: I'm at work on a book
titled "The Future of Human Beings" that will be published perhaps as soon
as this fall, and no later than spring '98. My approach is not to
immediately fire off the most hard to accept ideas in isolation, but to put
them in a developmental context to make the changes we foresee appear
highly reasonable and likely.

I agree with it, but it doesn't make cryonics or uploading pointless. 
First of all, his ontology could be wrong (happens all the time). 
Secondly, if you start seriously believing there is a perfect world where
you live a perfect life, what is to stop you from simply killing yourself
(there is even one such world where you kill yourself only to awaken in
your personal paradise!)? Just as Moravec previously claimed that hurting 
simulated beings was bad not because it changed the amount of suffering 
in the Manifold (they would get hurt anyway) but because it would change 
you to a worse person, I would say avoiding uploading because you would 
get it somewhere would change you to a worse person. 

I really hope he will not go the same way as Tipler and Penrose, seduced 
by his personal philosophy. Sometimes I'm glad I keep to the sane and 
practical areas of neuroscience... ;-)

Yes, it could get away with that once.  But if you are faced with a phrase
you've never heard before, you will usually respond meaningfully.  Almost all
decent poetry is novel, for example, but I imagine you don't say "I don't
understand" everytime you hear poetry.  The lookup table will quickly be
exposed as having no ability to respond to novelty, if you choose to ckeck
that.

Tipler is Omega Point.  Dyson is we keep on eking out our lives.
Moravec seems to be "copies of us will exist somewhere else".  What's

In the process of redesigning my Web site to include a number of
small essays, I wanted to create some method for comments and
rebuttals to be included.  I have designed a rebuttal-bot system
for this purpose which I will describe here.  I solicit comments
and suggestions for improvement.

Current design:
  - Each essay has a button-bar at the top leading to commentary
    pages.  Positive and negative comments are separate (I don't
    want to dilute the entertaining rebuttals with me toos).
  - On each commentary page, there is a form by which the
    reader can enter his own comments.
  - All comments, without exception or edition, are displayed on
    the comment page for a certain amount of time, after which
    they rotate out (only if they become numerous enough to
    require it).
  - Interesting rebuttals that I think deserve more thorough
    treatment are moved to a permanent discussion page.  I will
    inform the submitter that I have done so, add my counter-
    argument, and solicit a counter-rebuttal.  The rebutter
    always gets the last word.
  - The comment pages will also contain links to other pages
    with similar ideas (both pro and con), and readers will be
    able to suggest links as well.  Commentaries themselves can
    contain URLs.
  - Every piece of text (mine and comments) is headed by date and
    author (unless submittor wants to be anonymous, which will be
    honored).

Unless we accept the idea of a "soul", we must operate under the concept
that our wetware is the sum of our mind. Given this, any operating
system that cannot be distinguished from an intelligent being must be
considered an intelligent being. What people object to is the idea that
a couple gigs of programming whipped up by kids too young to shave can
be compared to what nature has taken billions of years of evolution to
attain. Religious (monotheistic types) people rightly fear AI
technology. If it becomes easy for Dennis the Menace to create an
intelligent race, Jerry Fallwell's monopolistic god's trust has been
busted. Religious libertarianism anyone? Homegrown nukes are nuthin
compared to being able to create and destroy whole races and ecologies
for a power trip.

I mentioned cryonic suspension in my bilogy lab last week, and a woman 
responded more or less like this: "Oh, the ultimate self-indulgence, to 
think you should bless the people of the future with your presence."

It's amazing how much a person can reveal about their world view with one 
off-handed utterance.

Exovivo!

"Nothing gets justified...everything get criticized." [Bartley, 112]

Pure Rationality seems to have become the ontotheological god or
absolute of Pancritical Rationalism (PCR). This Rationality can be
criticized, but it must be criticized with Rationality. Is this not
circular? PCR seems to be yet another failed attempt at removing the
authority, the authority being attenutauted very well in most areas, but
then magnified and exalted in Rationality. 

"By replacing justificationism with fallibilism, and by encouraging the
practice of opening to, welcoming, and respecting criticism,
pancritical rationalism maximizes the pursuit of truth [...]" [More]

What is truth? It will take some effort to convice me that truth is not
a religious concept. This is another exogenous sublimation of god. I
don't think science can say anything about truth. You said, "nothing is
*provable* in science, only refutable". Is truth refutable? How do we
know that in our pursuit for truth that we have attained it or not? I
see a disparancy here between your thought and that of PCR. To overcome
authority, as PCR attempts to do, I think you might have to replace
"truth" with something like "the next most functional", or "the next
most useful". Sure, this is only a further sublimation, but at least it
is something science can actually deal with. Science is about
prediction, the terms it uses to create theories of prediction are just
as fanciful as those of any mythology. The terms of science do not
necessarily exist, but that does not matter. What matters is, does any
particular scientific theory allow us to predict something, and is there
a competing theory which more accurately predicts the same. We cannot
attain truth or meaning from science. Rationality is the almighty tool
for developing theories of prediction, but we cannot attain truth or
meaning from rationality. I point out your desire for truth as an
inconsistancy in your system. Fortunately the extropian system is "open"
to revision. Though rationality is certainly not inconsistent with your
system, I am going to attempt to criticize it while showing how it could
be augmented with other modalities of consciousness.

------------

"This optimism [Dynamic Optimism] is dynamic since it rejects any form
of passive faith." [More]

Dynamic Optimism is the same as dynamic faith. Where exoteric religion
tends to be biased towards passive faith, esoteric religion certainly is
not.


"Contrary to faith, dynamic optimism recommends experimentation to
uncover the truth" [More]

How would esoteric religion have ever developed without embracing
experimentation?

Are those boundaries absolute? Is there a dogmatic and unquestionable
boundary separating religion and science? Is it really that black and
white? In your article on PCR you criticized Rand for sharply defining
everything as black and white. This was in a different context, but does
that criticism not hold here?


Lets take "artificial intelligence". There is a definite bias here for
intelligence. "Cognitive science" has the same bias. Perhaps artificial
consciousness would be better, for consciousness is certainly more than
intelligence alone. Is intelligence anything more than refined, highly
articulated emotion?

      emotive --> intuitive --> cognitive 
      subtle    -->    highly articulated   

How are we going to create something intelligent when we are not
starting with the basics? We should be more concerned with making
something feel need and desire before we attempt to make something
intelligent. 

What is science fiction? Science fiction tends to inform this Elist a
great deal. We quote people such as William Gibson as if they were
authorities on science, when they are more like religious shamans and
their stories are more like religious mythology; modern mythology. This
sort of writing is often apcolyptical, or utopian. But what I like most
about it is its focus on need and desire. Science fiction tends to be
about either what we want to attain, or what we ought to avoid. Its not
about truth. I feel that science fiction is an actual field of science,
a field which ought to be further embraced and explored. It removes our
focus from epistemological truth, and returns it to the emotions, to
need and desire. Truth is of little importance. Effectivenes and
functionality our much more important. Truth won't help me overcome my
needs and attain my desires. I have no desire to attain truth. Its a
worthless ontotheological concept to me. And again, this doesn't hurt
science, because science is not even capable of speaking about truth.
Science fiction helps us open our minds to potential where science
without Science fiction is dead. Is imagination a rational mode of
thought. I don't think so. Where would science be without imagination,
yet science denies the use of it. Without imagination, intuition, and
emotive passion, we would not have genius, but these things science
refuses to incorporate. It pretends not to employ them. A scientist must
be obsessively passionate, but his sciences itself is completely lacking
in passion.  

Lets look at the objective bias of science. This bias has left us wholly
ignorant of our own endogenous realities. This is a real problem of
science. It is wholly focused on the other, on the object, on the
external. Here is where science could recursively learn something from
religion. How can we create a new science which allows us to talk about
endogenous worlds? The first thing it would have to do is to find a way
to embrace emotion. Science attempts to speak about emotions but its not
emotive. Science is cognitive and as such is only able to penetrate
matters of a cognitive nature.

Our education today is almost completely cognitive. But we do not have
the maturity to deal with the knowledge and technology we have created
via our intensive cognitive education. We need an emotive education to
balance our cognitive education. Memetics is perhaps a small step in
this direction. It amazes me how few people take responsibility for
their emotions. People are constantly offended and embarrassed by my
discussions with them. Thus they lose control of their emotions before
we can reach any depth of meaning. If we taught people how to take
responsibility for their emotions in school, this problem would be
greatly attentuated. Education would be *more effective* augmented with
emotive education. We need to teach people not to give others power of
their emotions so easily. I should not be able to embarass someone I
have only met 10 minutes ago. We need to become familiar with the
subtleties of the emotive so that we can use it to empower and impassion
our reason.

I think this has a great deal to do with the lack of genius in our
society. People lack emotive and intuitive discipline. Still, I am not
confessing to know how these things could be synergized with science,
but I can see very clearly the effect of their repression. Science is
still lacking in many ways. 

 
> No, religion is definitely not the foundation of science, and faith has no
> role in science.

That doesn't sound like a statement that can be criticized. Very
dogmatic, but I believe I have done so above.

I am impressed with the Extropian involvement in politics. This seems to
help bridge the gap between science and politics. I believe this is a
step in the right direction. By assimilating them they can work together
and not against each other. Perhaps that is not the intention, but by
bringing a particular kind of science and a particular kind of politics
together under the umbrella of extropy you have created some sort of
isomorphism between them. I would like to see this same sort of
isomorphism begin between the cognitive, the intuitive, and the emotive.
Truely I believe this will only propel science further.  

Though you may feel like "choking" while reading my posts, I certainly
appreciate your criticism. A lot of science is about taking risks. I am
taking the risk of exploring this idea to see if there is anything to
it. Perhaps not, but if there is it will certainly develop and become
more refined with time. I am not suggesting a return to primitive
concepts and modalities of consciousness, but rather a recursive and
transcending re-assimilation of them. We have greatly refined
rationalization, but its not enough. Just like an AI cannot understand
analogies, if we were merely rational neither would we. We are able to
understand obscure and poetic analogies because our memory makes
irrational associations based on feelings, emotions, and patterns of
sensation, as well as rational associations.

Not True. We mean that if A exists then B will exist further along a sequence.

I agree that the Turing Test is not a theory of intelligence but it is a sure
fire test for it, if somebody acts intelligently then they are certainly
intelligent. There could be debate over whether a given act, such as writing
a post, is intelligent or not, in fact it's one of the main topics of this
list, but once you grant that an act is intelligent then the thing doing that
intelligent act must be intelligent, end of story.

Things are not quite as clear cut as far as consciousness is concerned, but
I still think The Turing Test is a good, but not perfect, test for 
consciousness. Evolution is concerned only with our external actions, with
our intelligence, not with out consciousness, however important it may be
to us. If you could have intelligence without consciousness then I don't see
why Evolution would have ever bothered to give us consciousness in the first
place.

Certainly in daily life ever one of us assumes that The Turing Test works
for consciousness, nobody this side of a loony bin really thinks they are
the only conscious being in the Universe, but I grant you that it has never
been proven to be false.

I keep wondering if an exact copy of myself implies that I am

Not. It all depends on the addressing, and if the table's reply is
included in the next address to the table an indefinite sequence of
varying replies can be constructed.

In other words, the table uses the entire previous conversation as its
input, which serves as a memory of what went before.

Well, a finite HLT could be made for any Turing Machine with a finite
tape. This moves the question on to the person conducting the Turing
Test, as that person's input is equivalent to some of the TM's tape.
In practical terms, the HLT probably cannot be created for it would have
more entries than particles in the Universe. Same comment to the TM's
tape....

Obviously more compact representations are possible (like us)

I had the same reaction to Eliezer's definition of causality, but
I was perusing an old comp.ai.philosophy archive from a few years
ago the other night, and I saw almost the same definition being used.
So apparently it is accepted by some school of philosophers.

(I think I found it by an altavista web search on "humongous lookup table".)

An idea which is very common in science fiction is being able to directly
experience another person's consciousness.  This may be done through
telepathy, through mechanically assisted mind reading, through some kind
of upload/download process; a hundred different methods have probably
been described.

Do you think it would ever be possible to do this, or does this seem like
something which is fundamentally impossible?  If it could be done, then
this could provide some insight into the nature of other beings'
consciousness.

Greetings Reilly,

You are extremely talented in decontextualization. Bravo.

> [...] nothing is *provable* in science, only
> refutable. [More]

If science cannot prove something as true or false, then science cannot
attain truth. 

Once again, truth is not attainable by science. Even if you yourself are
completely obsessed with attaining truth via science, you will not get
it. Science predicts things, its a modern form of divination. It
predicts and nothing else. It cannot do anything more than predict, and
due to phenomena such as entropy and the butterfly effect we can never
be certain that those predictions will always be 100% correct.  

Your desire for truth is more of a religious fixation than any I have
displayed. 

Science is fundamentally driven by need and desire. We need to be able
to predict such and such to survive. I desire to predict such and such
in order to survive forever. Science is a tool of need and desire. It is
an emotive tool, yet it denies the emotions. Science is not a tool for
attaining truth. And even if it were, the desire to attain truth, is a
desire in-and-of-itself. I am interested in predicting that which is
necessary in order to enable me to attain that which I need and desire.
I have no desire to attain truth. We cannot even prove that absolute
truth exists. It does not matter. It would not even matter if in some
freakish sense that I myself did not "truely" exist. As long as I
"believe" that I exist, that is all that matters. If this is all an
illusion, who cares? Real or illusion, the truth does not matter. 

Today people say, "God is dead". Tomorrow people will realize that truth
died with him.

The concept of "truth" is not even compatible with Pancritical
Rationalism. Truth is truth, its either true or false. Truth cannot
sorta be truth ... thus the concept of truth is not open to criticism. 

I think the concept of truth is kept around in order to sustain
epistemology. It perpetuates a priority for knowledge and cognition over
intuition and emotion [the latter including need and desire].

Without emotion science could not even exist. No one would feel the
emotion of need or the emotion of desire in order to create science.
Science can exist without truth though. It can exist in a subjective
world without absolute absolutes just as long as things remain nearly
the same long enough for us to treat them as objective and thus to
enable us to predict things. We can functionally entertain the idea of
absolute things without them truely being absolute. Suppose what we
think of as constants are merely shifting in degree at an infintessimal
level beyond our ability to measure. Its possible. But in the end it
does not matter. 

I think Descartes proved once and for all with his evil genius theory
that we can never attain truth, because we can never prove it. But we
discard such circular theories in science because deep down we know its
not important. Then we must ask ourselves, "For what reason do we cling
to it?"    


> Well, chalk up yet one more twentieth-century vote in favor of lies and
> propaganda.

Ah, lets talk about honesty. I imagine that you believe yourself to be
an upright honest individual. However, I have serious doubts that anyone
is truely honest. Why? Because we are not even aware of all our
underlying motivations. How much of what I say is determined by my
genetics, by my subconscious, and by the particular chemical content of
my CNS at any given moment? How can you be absolutely honest with others
when you cannot even by honest with yourself. You do not know yourself
well enough. You are not aware enough of whats going on subconsciously
to imagine that you are being truthful. To a degree we attempt to be
honest, but only to a degree. If we were truly interested in genuine
interaction with others without underlying subconscious motivations
affecting our thoughts and actions, then we would spend a great deal
more time attempting to make conscious what is now subconscious. This
requires a lot of attention given to the emotions.

I'm not so sure. I have noticed that I can do certain things, for example
play a very fast game of table tennis, and "loose consciousness".I mean
that the normal process of internal analysis of my thinking, my
"metacognition", is temporalily turned off. It is almost like my ego
disappears. I think this doesen't just apply to sports either. I think the
ego can be temporarily suspended during the intense thought required to
solve a complex mathematical problem, for example. It may even be
beneficial to do so in these circumstances. I am still just as
intelligent, or maybe even more intelligent than I would be with my ego in
full swing.
I think consciousness has a lot to do with memory. For instance, if an AI
machine was designed that had the ability to store as memories the
consequences of it's actions, and form patterns and associations from
those memories, then it might start to develop a consciousness. In other
words, it would be able to develop a clear distinction between itself and
the outside world, which is really the definition of consciousness, or
ego. 
Remember that we all start out as id, and that our ego comes along when we
can remember enough of our actions and consequences to form coherent
patterns from them.

He is safe, but a bit boring. Tipler has the right mix of dynamic 
optimism and drama. Linde is a bit weird, and Moravec/Egan downright 
bizarre when you start thinking of it.

It's a software orrery for MS-DOS. 

Greg Burch showed it to me on his laptop a few months ago at Max's
house. I had never seen a rotatable 3D view of the asteroids in
their orbits before, and so it hadn't really sunk in for me that
the Trojan asteroids wander around up to 30 degrees fore and aft
of the relevant libration point, and that works out to several AU.
All the diagrams I had seen before show the Trojans clustered at
Jupiter's L4 and L5 points like tight little bundles (and the Belt
confined to the plane of the ecliptic), but in fact, the Belt is
toroidal like a giant 3D donut and the Trojans are like two *huge*
spherical Mickey Mouse ears stuck on the donut.  Probably most of
the people on this list realized this long ago, but it was news to
me and I got a big charge out of it.  As I said, I've got a lot of
catching up to do when it comes to celestial mechanics.

Mouseketeer hats will never look the same to me now. Thanks, Greg.

I don't see how the subjective could ever be made objective. Suppose a mind

subjective experience that I do, red looks the same to you as it does for me. 
How could I ever know if the machine was giving me correct information? 
The operating principles of the machine would have to be based on some theory
of consciousness, but I'd have no way of knowing if that theory was correct. 
      
There is an even more fundamental problem. My brain is different than yours, 
so If I want to know what it's like to be you I'd need something that could 
translate the states of your brain into states that my brain could understand. 
If I did that then I'd know what it's like for John Clark to be Hal Finney.
Unfortunately that's not what I want, and the only way for me to know what 
it's like for Hal Finney to be Hal Finney is to turn my brain into an exact 
copy of yours. Even then "I" wouldn't know what it's like to be you, because 
"I" wouldn't be John Clark anymore, I'd be Hal Finney.

Truth is not the same idea as proof. Science can attain truth but may be
unable to  prove it. That's why pancritical rationalism is so important. No
matter how well confirmed a theory is, not matter how it may seem to be the
truth, it may only be a close approximation too the truth.

Truth is the goal we seek in science and rationality in general. In one
sense, yes, either something is true or not. However, in another sense
there can be degrees of truth (are you familiar with fuzzy logic?), and we
can come closer to the truth. In moving from Newtonian absolute mass to
relativistic mass I think we have moved closer to the truth, perhaps even
have attained it. While there is literally no intrinsic mass, Newton's
views is subsumed as an approximation in the superceding theory.

Well, criticizing rationality with irrational argument wouldn't seem to be
a productive endeavor. But there is no circularity here, only a spiral of
argumentation. Rationality can be used to criticize itself (as you are
doing here), so it's not an "absolute" nor a "god". (I find your use of
"god" here inappropriate and puzzling.) The PCR conception of rationality
is an open one. Rationality is not an absolute, but a procedure that can be
applied to itself to further refine reason.

Science doesn't directly talk about truth, philosophy does. Science seeks
to create and test hypotheses. Philosophy of science (or scientists *as*
philosophers) can look at what science is doing and see that it is aiming
at truth. How do we know when we have attained truth? My answer is that you
generally do not know in any absolute way that you have attained truth.
That's the point of pancritical rationalism. All propositions must remain
open to challenge. Truth is an ideal at which we aim -- *if* we care about
accuracy, honesty, and progress. I would say you can know that you have
attained truth in some cases, but only if you take *know* to mean a
contextual certainty, not an absolute certainty. In this sense I know that
I am alive and male. If you throw out enough context through Cartesian
doubt, of course I cannot be absolutely certain of this knowledge.

>see a disparancy here between your thought and that of PCR. To overcome

This is hopeless strategy. If you throw out truth as what you seek to
approach, how can you have any standard by which to determine whether an
idea or procedure is more functional or useful than another? Is it *true*
that it's more useful? Or merely a matter of opinion?

> We cannot
>attain truth or meaning from science. 

If I were to adopt your strategy, I would now say: "Doesn't that sound
dogmatic?"! 

How can you be so sure that we can't attain truth from science? (I didn't
say anything about meaning and do not want to muddy the waters.) If all you
mean is that, from the fact that a scientific theory has so far accurately
predicted many things, we cannot be sure that the entities it describes are
real in all respects rather than simply being close models of reality, I
can agree. For many years it seemed like the hypothetical substance
"caloric" explained heat transfer quite well. It also seemed that the
Newtonian conception of intrinsic mass fit reality. For a while, these
models apparently described reality, but they turned out to be incorrect.
They were replaced by thermodynamics and relativistic concepts.

However, from the fact that science cannot guarantee that its theories and
theoretical entities perfectly describe reality, it does not follow that
science *cannot* attain truth. It may attain it even though we may never be
totally sure that it has. More importantly, science has to aim at truth to
make progress.

I have never objected to *supplementing* reason with "other modalities of
consciousness".Some of the points you make about the importance of
emotional intelligence, of imagination and so on are fine. If you think
those points are contrary to my position, you do not understand my view.
Even science (let alone the rest of life) has a place for things other than
reason: the creation of hypotheses can come from any source, whether
"divine inspiration", inebriation, a relaxing, unfocused dreamtime in a hot
tub, or whatever. BUT, reason is needed to structure and test the ideas
generated. Good science is not done while in an unclear, undirected state
of mind. The content of your hypotheses can come from non-rational and
irrational sources, but they do not constitute remotely reliable knowledge
until they have been tested according to the rigorous (though revisable)
standards of reason and science.

No. Dynamic Optimism is the same as reason applied towards improving
things. It does not involve dogma, unquestionable truths. So it is not
faith, if by "faith" we mean (as I use it) "fixed belief in something in
the absence or contrary to the evidence."

>"Contrary to faith, dynamic optimism recommends experimentation to

To the extent that it embraces experimentation it is not *faith*. The
esoteric religions have more elements of critical experimentation and
bodily and psychological technology than the exoteric religions, or strands
of religion.

In my experience, I cannot have a productive conversation with most people
who say things like this. Those who reject truth as a goal and who want to
limit reason generally see discussion as the clash of perspectives with no
way of reconciling differences. However, I'm not sure that's the case this
time.

This is unfair, Gregory. It would be dogmatic if I offered it on its own
and unwilling to give a reasonable argument for it. However, I explained
what I meant by that and referred you to extensive arguments for my view.
Also, you say that the statement sounds like it can't be criticized but
then admit that you just did exactly that. You can't have it both ways!

Again, I'm not sure how much I disagree with you or agree with you. I have
no objection to other modes of thought other than the rational (which is
hard to exactly define and delimit anyway). What I do hold is that reason
is the arbiter of ideas generated by other processes. I do* think emotions
contain valuable information, imagination has enormous value, association
and connotation play important roles in our thinking. However, all these
processes are highly fallible and reason is needed to try to sort out what
yields truth (or useful information) and what doesn't. So, for instance, I
prefer Nathaniel Branden's views on the cognitive role of emotions to those
of Rand who declared that "emotions are not tools of cognition." Although
emotions should not serve as primary tools of cognition, I think Branden is
correct that we can learn from listening to our feelings things that we
might not discover by analytical thinking alone. But we still need to
rationally consider, check, and integrate the information gained from our
feelings.

I will try not to get drawn back into this discussion, since I'm supposed
to be working on my book. But it is an important issue to me, so perhaps I
won't be able to resist!

Onward!

Hardly. Accounting for the time spent to set it up, the lack of

If you are _guaranteed_ that it does not mess with your machine or it's

terse lately as I have been devoting a lot of time to an epic I am
writing...and yes, the epic is to be *very* extropian.




Delusions Of Grandeur


Welcome to the afterlife: a place of false surreality,
Where window-paine Charlemagnes bask in superficiality.
Meet the men who would live your life, the men who want to sell your soul,
The men of mercy, the men of faith, the men who just want control.
Welcome to your private Hell, reminding you of the thoughts unmade,
The heart of virtue, the core of fear where you take a promenade.
The idleness of vanity will lead to cold insanity,
A picture of confidence for the goodness of humanity.
Meet the men who would steal your faith and make you a catastrophe,
The men who'd love to suck you dry and watch the coming atrophy.
Welcome to the place where you give up and give in to disrespect,
A world where you must earn your pain and circumstantial retrospect.
Meet the men who would take your heart and drain it of the blood it wields,
The men who abhor reason and the concept the ideal yields.
Meet the one who would flush his world because he could not dare be true,
Welcome to the afterlife: the previous life is overdue.

     The expected return on equity capital is possibly the most
     important driving factor in asset allocation decisions. Yet,
     the long-term estimates we typically use are derived from
     U.S. data only. There are reasons to suspect, however, that
     these estimates of return on capital are subject to
     survivorship, as the United States is arguably the most
     successful capitalist system in the world; most other
     countries have been plagued by political upheaval, war, and
     financial crises. The purpose of this paper is to provide
     estimates of return on capital from long-term histories for
     world equity markets. By putting together a variety of
     sources, we collected a database of capital appreciation
     indexes for 39 markets with histories going as far back as
     the 1920s. Our results are striking. We find that the United
     States has by far the highest uninterrupted real rate of
     appreciation of all countries, at about 5 percent annually.
     For other countries, the median real appreciation rate is
     about 1.5 percent. The high return premium obtained for U.S.
     equities therefore appears to be the exception rather than
     the rule. Our global databases also allow us to reconstruct
     monthly real and dollar-valued capital appreciation indices
     for global markets, providing further evidence on the
     benefits of international diversification.

  I think it all depends on the security of the application.
We all allow third parties (banks, mutual funds, etc.) to play
with our money while we are not using it, and find it both
more profitable and safer than just sitting on cash.

Eugene Leitl suggested that charging for browsing and payments
for usage of resources should be connected only thru the user's
wallet, and I agree with it.  So there can be a few sites that can
distribute the code - you connect to them before, during, or after
other sessions, and your machine executes code while on-line, or not.
The payments can be different - they can go to your bank account, or
you get NetCredits for buying things online, or you get enrolled into
a lottery with *good* chances to win a new super-PC or a cash prize.
Your machine can develop Alife critters, or improve chess algorithms.
If you work in your office on some low-security stuff, like designing
brochures or proof-reading students' homework, you will probably not
lose much by letting it evolve some cellular automata when you are not
using the machine anyway, and periodically communicate the results
back to the server (forget JavaScripts). In return, you will get enough
payments to offset your offline bills, and occasionally buy a new
peripheral for your computer. Or, if you want, you can donate all the
profits to the Libertarian party.  Besides, if your PC evolves something
interesting, your face may appear in some magazine.

  Whether Hara Ra is right considering this a security breach, is actually
beside the point, just as opinions of many people on using Netscape cookies
or lending their possessions to others.  The question is, will *some* people
trust the system enough to decide that the benefits are worth the risks?
I'd say there will be such people.

Now, if we accept very conservative estimates of the number of such people and
the utility of their computers - at 10% of PCs(that's 10 million PCs) and $10
a month, we have a billion dollar a year market.  That seems attractive enough
to develop the system, resolve many security issues and prepare the market for
expansion, by an order of magnitude - or two.

An interesting question is how the government can tax your earnings.
Deducting them from the price of PC ownership seems too much hassle -
then every computer owner would be registered as a small entrepreneur.

If you tax only big companies, and only at a point of converting
NetCredits into conventional currency, then we have a huge liquid market
of new currency that has never been taxed.  Your earn it on-line, spend
it on-line, and accumulate it online.  It is possible, of course, to
micro-tax micro-transactions, but then the government will have to write
efficient taxing agent software, and that will probably not happen very soon.

Ok, suppose it is done without the aid of a machine, but directly.  It turns
out that ESP and telepathy is possible with the right training.  In time
you learn to directly perceive the innards of another person's mind.  You
see what he sees, follow his thoughts, feel what it is like to be him.

Now, if you're going to start suggesting that you don't know if this
is real, that you can't be sure that you are really feeling what he
feels, then this starts to sound like solipsism.  You would be directly
perceiving his mind, and to deny these perceptions would be no more
justified than to deny the other perceptions you have.  How do you
know that the world is really there, that your senses are giving you
the right information?  I think the answer is that we accept it because
our senses give us a consistent picture.  Other people report the same
things, our sense cross check each other consistently, and it all adds up.

If the same thing were true of these mental perceptions, then I'd say we
would have equal grounds to accept them as real.  If the person whose mind
I am reading agrees with my statements about what he seems to be feeling,
if other people reading his mind perceive the same things I do, then I have
grounds for believing them to be real.

There could also be an underlying theory which puts our observations into
a logical framework.  If I perceive your reds to be greenish, then it
might be logical that you would perceive my reds to have a purple shade.
With a body of consistent observations like this we have further grounds
for accepting these perceptions.

Granted, the existence of this kind of telepathy may be hard to accept,
but I don't think we could say that it is impossible.  And even if it
turns out that mechanical intervention is necessary, it would still seem
that the reasoning above would apply.

This is a little too philosophical for me.  It's not clear what it means
for John Clark to be Hal Finney, and how that differs from Hal Finney being
Hal Finney.  Suppose that while John Clark is being Hal Finney, he feels
exactly the same as Hal Finney being Hal Finney.  Then, when the mind reading
is over, he goes back to feeling like John Clark, but he still has his memories
of what it felt like to be Hal Finney (or to be Hal Finney feeling like he
was Hal Finney?  the mind reels...).

In any case, as I said I think this overanalyzes the situation, like the
guy who said he wasn't seeing the world, he was seeing his retina.  Given
a world in which mind reading was possible with consistent, logical results
as I described, I think we would naturally accept these perceptions on a
par with those of our other senses.  There might be some people who refuse
to, just as there are no doubt people today who refuse to accept the
evidence of their senses.  But this could put them at a disadvantage, and
I suspect they would be relatively few.

Why should we be pessimistic about these results?

Yes, the United States has been the exception - it has more closely 
approximated a free-market system than any other nation.  But as more 
nations shed the shackles of socialism and mercantilism, as seems to 
be the trend, shouldn't they too begin to approach the capital 
appreciation rates experienced in the U.S.?

I would think the real question would be: as more nations achieve 
freer market mechanisms is the more level playing field and greater 
global competition going to drag everyone down or up?

Assuming the capability to, as Hal puts it,

<directly perceive the innards of another person's mind.  You see what 
he sees, follow his thoughts, feel what it is like to be him.>

the question is, what happens to your own historical sensations, 
memories and feelings while this mind link is occurring?

If they are somehow completely disconnected, how would you remember 
the experience once you were no longer linked?  Or, if you still had 
access to your own thought processes during the link then wouldn't 
those act as a filter for those of the other person, so that you would 
never really be directly experiencing what it is like to be them?

(Perhaps Anders could answer this since he seems to have experience 
with sub-personalities (; )

But, seriously, the ability to _integrate_ multiple sources of 
'experience' would definitely be needed by an upload with multiple 
robot bodies wandering around the world, and even by someone who is 
just 'jacked into' cyberspace and receiving simultaneous inputs from 
many sources on the Net, let alone a direct mind-link to another 
person.

Perhaps we'd need to more fully develop some sort of mental or 
augmented-reality /whiteboard/ capability to effectively handle this.

That's the positive interpretation.  Let's hope its true.  Note the
implication though:  Most capitalists have never appreciated the value
of free markets, or they would have invested here instead of elsewhere.

Likely up, given the assumption above.

The endowment effect describes the fact that people demand much more to
give up an object than they are willing to spend to acquire it. The
existence of this effect has been documented in numerous experiments. We
attempt to explain this effect by showing that evolution favors
individuals whose preferences embody an endowment effect. The reason is
that an endowment effect improves one's bargaining position in bilateral
trades. We show that for a general class of evolutionary processes
almost all individuals will have a strictly positive and finite
endowment effect.

So sources of the disturbances in the economic progress are:
political upheavals, wars, and financial crises. I'dd add
natural catastrophes and environmental crises as reasons for
some of the above.

Many of these - or most -  are caused by reasons that have little
to do with a market economy.

U.S. today seems naturally shielded from some of them - at this
point, it is not likely to start a big war, or be attacked; the
size of the economy gives an insurance against most natural
catastrophes, that could devastate a little country; environment
seems pretty safe at this point as well.

I would not rule out a possibility of political or financial crises
though - and *some* probability of wars, epidemics or huge natural
catastrophes.

I recently listened to a speech of an investment salesman projecting
the 401(K) profits for my colleagues based on the previous performance
of the market.  In all such calculations, it is assumed that the string
of luck will continue indefinitely, U.S. government will exist forever,
and the probability of any disruptions is exactly equal to 0.
This creates a comfortable feeling of (false) security that leads many
people in their 20s to take money away from travel, health or education,
and entrust it to the big financial institutions.

On another note, I feel quite suspicious about all these statistics.
They do not take into account any new products and structural changes
and economic and social novelty.

The 5% growth is in oil, cars, and pork bellies in some constant prices.
The fact that people can now use less oil to accomplish the same things
(like sending messages), use safer cars and food, and enjoy new services
and products that just did not exist a few years earlier, is not accounted
in the economic statistics.  Neither does quality of the environment, level
of public education, etc.

My personal quality of life increased immeasurably in the last several
years, with the development of the Internet, and my understanding of it.

I have yet to see an indicator of progress that would take it into account.
The statistics show the quantity of resources spent by the economy - the
amount of oil burned, number of letters delivered, new office space
constructed, counseling services provided, etc. It does not measure the
quality of the results - the utility of information received, efficiency
of offices, health and wisdom of the population, stability of social
structures, etc.  When the same ends can be satisfied with new, better,
and cheaper technologies, all traditional quantitative indicators can
plunge, while the results may dramatically improve.

There may be methods allowing to reduce qualitative progress to quantitative
measures.  For example, I can ask myself whether I would sacrifice my Net
access to add $100K to the value of my house.  Well, I wouldn't.

I will attempt a summation then. Thank you for taking the time to delve
into this issue with me. As is so often the case, one of our
difficulties in this discussion has been a discrepancy in our
definitions of common words, the word "truth" in particular. I was
thinking of truth as an absolute in a purely dichotomous sense while you
treating it as a something contextual, something that could be achieved
in degrees. 

What you have called truth in the contextual sense, I call for lack of
better words, functional. I do this in order to distinguish the absolute
from that which can be attained by degree. What you would call true I
would call functional or useful. I believe this is a subtle
philosophical shift. It attentuates the epistemological priority of
knowledge while enhancing the axiological priority of emotion qua
need/desire. This shift occurs because knowledge is concerned with truth
[and thus purely cognitive], while need and desire are more concerned
with functionality [and thus gratification].Perhaps this is an
irrelevant or irrational distinction. So far I can only offer intuitive
reasons for this differentiation and correlating priority shift. 


Reasons for shift:

1. Increase our sensitivity to our emotions qua need and desire, thus
enabling us to become more aware or more "knowlegeable" of our needs and
desires. By this I mean, that most of our desires are formed
subconsciously. Desires which are formed subconsciously cannot be
checked rationally, and the more that is determined subconsciously the
less freedom we have by degree. So in attempting to make conscious what
has hitherto been subconscious, we can learn to take responsibility for
it. We cannot take responsibility [at least not yet] for something that
is determined subconsciously. We have no control over it.     
  
2. Increase our maturity, our rational control over our emotions, so
that we can effectively deal with the enormous amount "knowledge" we are
collecting via our intensive cognitive educations. For this I propose an
equally intensive emotive education in our public and private schools.
This would begin in the first grade. Most schools do not even teach
psychology until high school, some that I know of only allow the juniors
and seniors to enroll in these courses. No school that I am aware of
teaches a true emotive education. Its difficult to conceive of at first.
How do you *test* a student's ability to delve into the subconscious?
How do you test their ability to make conscious what is subconscious.
How do you objectively test something so seemingly subjective? There are
methods however, and those methods will continue to develop.
	I believe violence in general, and specifically science for the purpose
of violence would be greatly reduced if we included emotive education in
our schools.  
 
3. Enhance our ability to direct science. Science is a tool first and
foremost. Perhaps the meta or general purpose [desire] for the tool of
science is to achieve truth. Regardless, in particular, we seek specific
things we wish to enable via science, e.g. immortality. If we become
more "knowledgeable" and aware of our emotions, and what is going on
subconsciously, then we will have more control over the direction that
science moves in. Right now, science is in much part directed by
subconcsious forces [desires] that we are not in touch with. Thus the
direction that science is moving in is more determined than it need be.
Perhaps I might call this a desire for scientific freedom. There are
many arguments stating that we are wholly determined, but those
arguments only stand as long as their is a clear distinction between
freedom and determinism, and just as you pointed out the degrees of
truth, there are certainly degrees of freedom.     

4. Enhance ectstasy. For me, ecstasy qua self-epiphany is the climax of
being. It is what makes life worth living. An emotive education would
aid people in fostering ecstasy ... it would help attentuate social
taboos of self-gratification. Ecstasy can be achieved through pure
emotion, intuition [eureka!], and even cognition, but a sensibility of
the emotions is a must if one wishes to attain ecstasy on a regular
basis rather than at few random times in life.

5. Better control over our modalities of consciousness. Our emotions
effect our centreal nervous system (CNS) and vice versa. If we learn to
control our emotions as connoisseurs of consciousness, then we can
sustain modes of consciousness such as rationality and ecstasty for
extended periods of time. Just as conflicting emotions often combine to
create new emotions, perhaps we will discover new modes of rationality
when such modes dynamically clash in the same moment with some form of
ecstasy.

6. With a much better first hand understanding of our emotions and
endogenous realities I believe that we will have a much greater chance
at creating a truely profound AI.

7. Greater maturity for the coming dissolving of governement. It might
not be the best word to use, anarchy, but I believe that it is in a
sense where Libertarianism is leading us ... just in a sense perhaps,
but in any fashion, Libertarianism requires that we take responsibility
from the governement and claim those responsibilities for ourselves. In
a psuedo-anarchic system we will need to have learned a great deal more
about our emotions and how to effectively employ them before we can
imagine such a system to remain orderly. I know this is open to
argument, and thats not what I am seeking here, but I think you might be
able to entertain my perspective for a moment.

8. Fostering genius in our youth. Genius is something much more than
cognitive skill. Genius requires an enhanced emotive and intuitive
sensibility. We do not foster genious in our schools because we do not
foster these latter sensibilities. We shove knowledge down the throats
of our youth without teaching them how to teach themselves. Intelligence
is much more than being able to recite facts. Intelligence requires the
ability to think in new and novel ways, which requires a sensibility to
emotion and intuition.

9. Lastly, it is perhaps possible that a new assimilation of reason and
emotion might be the very thing necessary to begin something
transcendental of science and to thus set off the hypothetical
singularity.

I agree entirely. I was not attempting to claim that the emotions should
be employed without reason. I believe I was quite clear in stating that
I wished to see the two used together, which you have now clarified to
me that you have no problem with.  

I'm not sure if I have convinced you of the importance of including
emotive concepts in a system such as extropy or not, and I'm not sure if
this is the time for you to reflect on it, but I would humbly suggest
such in the future. Much of my confusion regarding your stand on emotive
"intelligence" could have been reduced if there were some extropian
documents which made an honest effort to deal with this issue.  

I believe I point this out in a similar fashion as "Mark Miller
expressed his view that "epistemological issues are the great missing
piece in Extropian philosophy right now."" I am expressing a view that 
emotive issues are now "the great missing piece in Extropian
philosophy."

I know you do not wish to debate this further, and I do not intend to
... its just food for thought.

Good luck on the book Max,

Never could be entirely, but it will probably be possible to make the
subjective more objective by degree without ever reaching true
objectivity. You could at least get a better sense of what it would be
like to be Hal. I think we slightly attune in this fashion everyday when
we attempt to communicate. In order to understand what another person is
attempting to express to us we have to momentarily try to empathetically
become like them in order to understand what they are saying as closely
as possible to the way that they understand it. When communicating
mathematics of course their is less empathy required than when we are
talking about a person's piece of artwork. The more subjective the
matter, the more empathy or attunement required.

The more we have in common, the more we can communicate.

I'm not sure, but I don't think Hal meant experiencing the entirety of
the other person's consciousness. I think he may have meant to
experience another person's consciousness in the fashion of
communication, which again only requires a small degree of attunement. I
am pretty certain that the enabling technology for this sort of
interaction does not lie to far off in the future. It will be particular
interesting to me, because it should allow for a much more dynamic and
somewhat less subjective expression of emotions.

The two extremes are not very parallel to one another, because we
have tons of Platos's writings and none of Democritus's writings,
so it is difficult to compare the two. But Aristotle is something
like a reformed and corrected Plato compared to Democritus, a Plato
with the raging excesses of abstraction cut back. Based on the
little we know of Democritus, he was a good deal more radical than
either Plato or Aristotle. But they say that Democritus was the
first to claim that the Milky Way is composed of stars too dim to
resolve with the naked eye, so he was probably a pretty good
observer, and Aristotle did stress observation more than Plato did.

It's really mostly a matter of accident that Aristotle is so famous
at all. He was reputed to be a good writer, but we will never know,
because *everything* he published has been lost. The horribly dry
"books" that we have from Aristotle are all just lecture notes...
they survived because they spent several centuries in someone's
basement, instead of getting torched with all the rest of the great
classical libraries. After the Crusaders sacked Constantinople
(centuries before the Turks came and took over the charred remnants),
what was left of Greek literature was essentially a small random
sample.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if the best stuff got lost,
and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Democritus turned out to be
among the best stuff. But now all we can do is ponder the fragments
(quotations in books written by lesser minds, who quoted Democritus
only to refute him by citing conventional wisdom) and wonder.

Actually, I shouldn't be too hard on old Ari. There are some parts
of the Nicomachean Ethics that I like a great deal.

Gregory Houston: <I have no desire to attain truth.>

RJ: Well, chalk up yet one more twentieth-century vote in favor of lies and
propaganda.

Gregory Houston wrote 2/13/97: <You are extremely talented in
decontextualization. Bravo.>

Perhaps so, but I didn't show it above.  Far from engaging in
decontextualization, I simply repeated the sum total context of your post,
namely, "I have no desire to attain truth."  Once you have said this,
everything else you post must be viewed as untruthful, hence, contextless. 
Context itself has no meaning absent truth.

<If science cannot prove something as true or false, then science cannot
attain truth.>

Look at science more broadly as technicism, see that there is no boundary
between science and technology, and you will see that technology verifies
the theoretical statements of science in actuality.

<Your desire for truth is more of a religious fixation than any I have
displayed.>

Why bother asserting this, since, according to you, you have nothing
truthful to say?  Why bother saying anything at all?  To me, your vigorous
support of lying indicates quite a strong religious bent, you worship the
Father of Lies, ol' Beelzebubba.

<Science is fundamentally driven by need and desire. We need to be able to
predict such and such to survive. I desire to predict such and such in
order to survive forever.>

There is a rich hoard of historical literature, much of it
autobiographical, about scientists (and natural philosophers) being
motivated by the pure search for knowledge itself, completely unconnected
to any animal desire for survival.  Perhaps they all were lying about this.

<Science is a tool of need and desire. It is an emotive tool, yet it denies
the emotions.>

This is clearly untrue, scientists undeniably squeal like stuck pigs when
their government funding is cut.  They get quite emotional about it.

<We cannot even prove that absolute truth exists.>

Who is this "we"?  Perhaps you need to broaden your circle of associates.

<It would not even matter if in some freakish sense that I myself did not
"truely" exist.>

This appears to be an agreeable statement.

<Real or illusion, the truth does not matter.>

Really?

<Today people say, "God is dead". Tomorrow people will realize that truth
died with him.>

I think you mean that a hundred years ago people said "God is dead."  Then
came the filthy French compost-modernists who pretended that truth died
with him.  Then came the inability for my children to go out in my
neighborhood without constant adult supervision for fear of the barbaric
perverts who grew up inculcated with your religious beliefs.

<Truth is truth, its either true or false.>

It's true that I cannot parse this sentence.

<I think Descartes proved once and for all with his evil genius theory
that we can never attain truth, because we can never prove it.>

He did?  He was French, n'est pas?  Well, my microwave oven proved to me
the truth of Maxwell's theories.  I realize Descartes did not have the
benefit of microwave ovens.

<How can you be absolutely honest with others when you cannot even by
honest with yourself. You do not know yourself well enough. You are not
aware enough of whats going on subconsciously to imagine that you are being
truthful.>

Do not make the mistake that because you are confused, that others are
similarly confused.  This is an invalid deduction.  Certainly, since you
have once again repeated that "I have no desire to attain truth," we can
all see that you have no intention whatsoever of being honest, even if you
weren't internally confused.

<The concept of "truth" is not even compatible with Pancritical
Rationalism.>

This topic came up on the list in March 1994.  At that time, I was
concerned, based on the positions that some individuals were taking on PCR,
that your statement above was quite probably true.  However, this point,
for me, was cleared up by Max More when he wrote:

"PCR *is* grounded in subjective purposes in the sense that, if my one of
my goals was not to be as rational as possible, I would not be interested
in PCR.  Even if PCR can be successfully defended against all criticisms,
it will never appeal to persons who care nothing for consistency, truth, or
reason.  In this sense, PCR is grounded in one's values and so is not "smug
nihilism".  Note that this is not to say that PCR is *justified* in terms
of  one's values; it means only that one's acceptance of PCR is explained
by one's  valuing rationality in combination with believing that PCR, so
far, provides the  best, most consistent, characterization of what it means
to be a rationalist."

To which I replied: 

"I support this unreservedly.  I am glad to see it made explicitly because
only by making it explicit does PCR avoid being merely smug nihilism."

Recently, I ran across an analysis of this same point by the philosopher
Etienne Gilson who concluded (rightly) that: "You must either begin as a
realist with being, in which case you will have a knowledge of being, or
begin as a critical idealist with knowledge, in which case you will never
come in contact with being."

What Gilson refers to as the "critical idealist" I was referring to as the
"smug nihilist."  Being and truth are, of course, different aspects of the
same ontological primitive.  So really, Max and myself are saying the same
thing, that unless you begin with a care for truth, you will never have
knowledge.  You cannot begin with knowledge itself and get anywhere at all,
you must begin with caring for truth.

Reilly, please, let's have blame where blame is due. I hardly think
it is productive to blame this bad business on a bunch of French
literary critics, when the blame should actually be laid at the
feet of a political system that is busying itself jailing potheads,
mandating paperwork, collecting and spending huge amounts of taxes,
trying to prevent people from buying guns by mail order, having
military adventures in Bosnia, and nearly everything else under
the Sun *except* catching and convicting rapists and child molesters.

You must be a transcended superintelligence if your ability to
trace cultural causation is so overdeveloped that you *know* that
it's these particular French book-mongerers who are responsible
for the bad conditions in your neighborhood of North America, and
not someone nearer and more recent. I mean, seriously, isn't it
possible that Bill Clinton or the legislators of your state bear
a *tiny* bit more responsiblity for this state of affairs than
Gilles Deleuze or whichever French academic has upset you this
time?

No, the prediction is right.  This was the main point of my earlier mail.
The prediction was of what you would do given situation X.  When you do
something different, you are not in situation X, but situation Y, where
Y = X plus the knowledge of what the prediction was.

You can make a trivial computer program which reads a number and outputs
the next number.  Now we will try to predict what it will type next.
We input our prediction and see what it types.  Our prediction is
always wrong!  No matter what we input, it outputs something different.

This is not an example of free will by any reasonable criterion.  The
fact that a system's behavior is a function of its inputs means that
many, many systems will behave differently if one of their inputs is a
prediction about their behavior.  Such a trait is totally irrelevant to
any discussion of free will, because so many systems which no one would
claim have free will have this property, as well as systems that people
do claim have free will.

So I don't see that the fact that a person will behave differently given
a prediction of his behavior is at all relevant to questions of free will.

If you had a box which had a simulation of your mind which ran faster
than your own, then you could always find out what you were going
to do before you did it.  Would the existence of such a box make you
doubt your own free will?  Wouldn't it be strange to always have this
box around which knew exactly what you were going to do ahead of time?
I would find that it would make me question how "free" I really am.

Some people seem to be using "Truth" as a name for "The nature of
objective reality, in complete detail".  But this isn't useful or
meaningful, because used in this sense, there can be no falsehood:
reality just is, and if one refers to it completely, there can be
nothing that isn't part of that. 

The question, then, is out of that existence, where does the
meaningful notion of true/false come from?  My answer is that
"True" and "False" are properties of /assertions/, so to understand
truth we must first understand the nature of assertion.  I will
simplify by leaving out the communicative sense of the word, and
concentrate solely on assertions made to oneself, so differing
mental models do not complicate the picture.  I will further
simplify by leaving out the notion of time/causality so that we
can imagine a complete universe frozen in time except for the
single mind here making assertions about it.

What, then, is an assertion?  It is clearly some state, property,
or pattern existing in the mind that /represents/ some part of
reality.  Since our mind is a finite subset of reality, we can't
simply represent the whole thing--that would be just making a copy
of the universe.  We must perform /data compression/.  This, then,
is what I see as the fundamental nature of all thought: we cannot
be omniscient, so we store as much data as we can as compactly as
we can, along with /rules/, i.e., algorithms for reproducing some
representation of reality in greater detail than we have stored.

The representation of the universe in our mind consists of data,
including sense experience, and algorithms, some perhaps innate and
others created after birth.  Those we create after birth are formed
in much the way a computer performs data compression: by searching
for patterns in the inputs and generating rules the reproduce them
from smaller representations.

An assertion, then, (to oneself, remember) is a representation of
some of your de-compression rules.  The assertion "I saw a dog this
morning" contains many rules and references to stored data--some
that represent patterns you have found in dogs, mammals, mornings,
your own vision; some rules you have created to represent the
relationship between the stored sense-memories and reality, your
representations of yourself, and hundreds of other rules and data
chunks that serve to produce representations in short-term memory
("recall") for comparison with other recollections and more pattern
finding and rule making.  Patterns can be found in the rules, and
rules can be shared on different datasets, and meta-rules used to
compress sets of rules, etc.

What is "truth" in the static-universe sense?  It must be stronger
than merely lossless compression--that's just "consistency", in that
no input data are lost.  "Truth" must express a strong relationship
to reality itself--for a rule to be "true" it must not only retain
all data that are put into it, but all /possible/ data.  In other
words, it must losslessly compress /all/ data that represent any
property of whatever parts of reality it is meant to describe.  If
there does not exist any property of reality that the rule would
eliminate, then it is "true".

Let's get a bit more concrete: Since we do not wish to catalog in
our mind the charge of every particle we meet, we can compress those
data with rules like "those things fitting the description of an
electron in all aspects except charge will have a single fixed value
for charge, either positive or negative."  We can compress data for
other particles with the rule "electrical charges always come
discretely quatized in packets the size of the electron-charge."
If there exists any particle anywhere in the universe that doesn't
fit this pattern, then our rule would produce false data for it, and
it is therefore false.

How can we determine truth?  I think it's clear that we can't.  We
cannot know that our internal representation of reality covers all
properties of it, or that there does not exist a single counterexample
for any rule, or that we will be able to find all the properties of
reality and a complete set of rules.  We can, however, judge the
consistency of our rules with themselves and the data we apply them
to, and inconsistency is a sufficient condition for falsehood (since
true rules are a superset of consistent rules).

The quest for truth, then, is a quest for data, and rules sufficient
to compress all the data we need into representations we can use, and
that are never inconsistent.  But since multiple rule sets can be
consistent with all data collected so far, how can we choose among
competing theories?  Heuristics.  How much data does the rule compress
(i.e. expressive power)?  How compactly can we store the rule itself
(i.e. Ockham's razor)?  How many opportunities does the rule afford for
finding counterexamples (i.e. testability)?

You are correct, of course, about the statistics measuring "quantity 
of resources spent" rather than "quality of the results".  I work at 
producing the Consumer Price Index and the CPI has been much in the 
news lately for allegedly overstating inflation and failing to account 
for many quality improvements.

The problem, of course, is that we measure what it is easiest to 
measure and not necessarily what is it useful to measure.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (for which I work, and for which I am 
not speaking in this post) admits that the CPI can only approximate a 
Cost-of-Living Index.  And even if we could achieve a true COLI it 
would still not represent what Nina Munk, in Sep 14, 1992 Forbes 
magazine article, called a "convenience-of-living index".

And even then, there is still the issue of what is important to *your* 
quality of life vs. someone else's.
There is an excellent cartoon about these issues at
http://www.salon1999.com/comics/comics1961216.html
(by a guy called 'Tom Tomorrow' BTW!) where a guy who looks like Fred 
Mertz from "I Love Lucy" says to his wife: "Well Martha, the bad news 
is we can't afford to heat the house this winter -- but by God, if we 
ever scrape up enough for a computer it'll have more processing power 
than you ever dreamed possible."

Right now I'm heavily involved in trying to update the samples of 
goods and services that are used to produce the CPI.  We're trying to 
bring in such things as online services and cellular phones for the 
first time.  However, these things change so fast that it's extremely 
difficult to get a good sample.

MORE INTERESTING though, is your implied desire for a *personal* 
quality of living index.  Someday I'm hoping we get to the point where 
you could subscribe to your own 'personal COLI' where you'd indicate 
your geographic and demographic characteristics and, especially, which 
categories of goods and services are most important for your own 
needs, and the system would construct and weight a cost-of-living 
index tailored specifically for you.  Hmmm, maybe when I get tired of 
working for the government I'll see if I can construct such a 
system...

Do you take Moore's Law into account? Considering the amount of our
lives that now has to do with information and data processing, etc. some
of the key products to put in your basket are basic units like mips,
megs, bits, kilobaud, and dpi. Seeing as computing power has now become
a commodity product (people wonder why apple is going down the drain)
your idex should use simple units like this to measure the resources
being spent. Such units are not just abstract things either but have a
direct impact on the utility of a given product or service. A 64 bit
computer game is much more entertaining than an old 16 bit game, and a
56kbaud modem provides a much more enjoyable experience on the net than
a clunky old 14.4, with quadruple the download rate. I can access much
more information in a given time due to this.

Maybe thats a good thing, next thing you know the gov't will come out
with a convenience of living tax.

Maybe your bureau could do such research on the cheap much as many

fill out a survey. Maybe a rebate on taxes or something...

I would agree that counting these things is better than not counting.
This doesn't help that much though. I'll try to give two examples.

1.   Let's try to compute inflation.
Suppose the following goods were sold in the following years:


                 1980		      1997

           Quantity  price,      Quantity   price,
             sold     each         sold      each

Bicycles      1       $100        1         $200
Megs          1       $100        1000      $0.20
Bauds         -         -         56K       $0.001


Suppose the quality doesn't change (ha-ha).

Inflation on bicycles: about 4% a year
Inflation on Megs:     about -40% a year.
Inflation on Bauds:    ?

Now, more interesting:

Inflation on bicycles AND Megs.

Method 1.

 A 1980 typical basket of 1 bike +1 meg costs $200 in 1980
and $200.2 in 1996.   Inflation = 0.

 On the other hand, a typical 1997 basket of 1 bike and 1000 megs
in 1997 cost $400, and would have cost $100,000 in 1980.
Inflation about -40% a year.

So which basket should we count?

- and this all for the same goods of the same quality.

Now add bauds to the picture. And Netscape. And 60 million web pages
you can look through. And ideas on architectures of complex systems that
appeared while people were building all of these.  Still, these things
are just resources - and you can do use them to produce results that
were not even in anybody's imagination in 1980.  And those *results*
are the things you want to count.


2.  Another economic problem: a breast cancer patient had to pay $5000
for painful treatment and a coffin in 1980, and $20,000 in 1997 - for a
(painless) treatment only. The coffin doubled in price, but it is no
longer needed, as the patient now survives.
 What is the inflation rate here?

I profoundly disagree!  Perhaps current freezing techniques don't scramble
the information in a brain beyond the ability of future Nanotechnology to
recover it, I sure hope so, but I don't like the idea of trusting my life
to that hope. I'm tired of guessing and hoping, I want to KNOW.

The goal of The Prometheus Project is one million dollars a year for ten
years. That's still chump change by most research standards, but far more
money that ANYONE has ever spent in trying to preserve a human organ by
freezing and ASTRONOMICALLY more than anyone has spent specifically on the
brain. For all we know it could turn out to be easy, I doubt it, but we'll
never know until we try.
             

        >and it may actually not be possible.


That's true, it might not be possible, and Cryonics might not work either.

Well, it''s really quite simple, Greg.  The world has its ways.  We try
to capture its ways in words.  If we got it right, our words are 'true',
if we got it wrong, they're 'false'.  (There is of course some leeway in
that words can be closer to or further away from the truth.)

However, since we can't step outside ourselves to check words against
reality, when we call something true that means we *conjecture* it to be
true.  

All our knowledge is a shot at objective truth, but has the cognitive
status of conjecture.  Rational conjecture, in that we do our best to
test it, but conjecture nonetheless.

It never ceases to be conjecture,*even if it is true*.

And much of it may well be true.

That's about it.

Your argument is that if I deny truth then I am embracing what is false.
This is not the case. This is the same sort of thinking that says if I
deny God, then I embrace satan. Neither are *useful* statements to me.
When I deny one pole of a dichotomy, I do not embrace its opposite. I
deny the dichotomy entirely. I am replacing truth with something that
can serve all it functions while shifting some of the priority from
epistemology to axiology and the emotive. This is a shift from the 
true-false continuum to a useful-unuseful or functional-nonfunctional
continuum. It is a shift in priorities.

Then what about honesty you might say? I can be honest without ever
having to refer to the concept of truth, because we have found that
"honesty is the best policy." In the long run, it is not useful for me
to give people unuseful information. This is honesty qua usefulness
rather than honesty qua truth. It still works. Queerly enough, if people
took on this new definition of honesty, we might not be bombarded by so
much trivial and useless information. People might aspire to more useful
dialogue rather than merely truthful dialogue. A person can speak the
truth and still lose control of their emotions thus severly inhibiting
the depth of the discussion. But if the individual was instead concerned
with usefulnes, that individual would not find it useful to lose control
of their emotions. Thus that individual could offer the same information
as the former, while going much further in the argument without losing
emotive control. The person whose focus is on truth cannot be nearly as
honest as the person whose focus is on usefulness. This is because a
focus on truth entails a focus on knowledge and is thus limited to that
which is conscious. But a focus on usefulness entails a focus on the
emotions need and desire [something is only useful if we need or desire
it]. This person is going to want to first find the subconscious sources
of his needs and desires and then attempt to make those forces
conscious. The person with a focus on usefulness is then going to have
fewer unconscious forces determining that person's interaction with
others, while the person with a focus on truth is going to continue to
interact with people dishonestly because that person still has
underlying motivations which that person is unaware of. No one can be
absolutely honest, but by degree, the person focused on usefulness, will
be more honest, more free, more in control of self--emotively and thus
cognitively--than the person focused on truth.   

Does usefulness rule out pure or base science? Of course not. We have
found pure and base science to be often useful in enabling future
technologies.

Just scenario-spinning: hypothetically, what would be the difference
between a person who spent ten years meditating on truth, and another
person who spent ten years meditating on usefulness? Truth certainly
*sounds* much loftier.

Now lets imagine that the first individual spent the next ten years
applying truth to science, and the other individual spent the next ten
years applying usefulness to science.  


The following are what I hypothesize would be some of the differences
between these two individuals:
1. Using a greater portion of his/her consciousness, the individual
focused on usefulness would be more effective [useful] as a scientist
than the person focused on truth. This person would, having greater
control over his/her emotions, have a greater ability to rationalize,
pancritically or otherwise.
2. Though the person focused on truth can rationalize violence as
irrational, that person is more likely to be violent and to participate
in the creation of violent technology because that person does not have
the same control over his/her emotions as the person focused on
usefulness. A kleptomaniac might come to the realization that what he is
doing is *wrong* and that he would like to stop, but in that same
instance he steals something because he has not delved into his
subconscious in order to truly take responsibility for his emotive
drives. He may have the cognitive and rational skill to realize his
problem, but not the emotive capacity to truly deal with it. Based on
the same argument, a person who holds truth as a higher priority than
usefulness is more likely to be a Charlaten,
saying/thinking/rationalizaing one thing while feeling and doing yet
another. Severing emotion from cognition severs the individual.


Sidhartha was focused on truth. He came to the realization that "Life is
suffering." What if Sidhartha had been focused on usefulness? Would he
have came to the realization that "Life is unuseful." I cannot say for
sure, but I doubt it. Its easy to associate suffering with a general
concept as life, but it becomes a bit more difficult to associate
something like unuseful to a general concept like life. If life isn't
useful, its our own fault. Its not the fault of life. If I am bored and
useless its my own fault.

No, I was using survival as merely an example of a desire. You simply
have offered yet another example. Thank you, there are probably hundreds
of desires which motivate science.

Thank you again. One more example of where it might be beneficial
[useful] for scientists to gain greater control over their emotions.
Instead of "squealing" they might speak with emotive passion and
charisma. Instead of waisting hours, perhaps days and weeks, being
pissed off, they might be using that time *usefully* working on an
appeal or seeking funding elsewhere.

Was that a momentary lapse of emotive control? It does not appear to be
a useful reply and in terms of truth it is certainly relative to your
own opinion. You have once again taken a statement out of context and
thus shifted its meaning.

Wow, there is a leap in your argument that I am unable to follow. How
did we get from the French compost-modernists to my religious beliefs
and then to your paranoia of people molesting your children. A little
more elaboration might be appropriate here.

This is much less a matter of confusion than a matter of unawareness. I
think your focus on epistemology probably guided you to that conclusion.
Confusion has to do with knowledge, but what I am speaking about in this
example is about subconscious emotions that *we* are unaware of. Did you
deny that you have a subconscious? Are you completely aware of all that
motivates you?

This was sufficiently dealt with at the beginning of this Email. My

enhance them.

I will grant you that and am proved corrected. This does not however

If so then is truth as static as being? I'm not interested in platonic
primitives. I'll take becoming and usefulness over the concepts of being
and truth. The latter concepts and the priorities they entail create a
shift from the static to the dynamic, moving and changing, from the
absolute to the relative.

This argument is difficult for me. You first say that I have to care for
truth to have knowledge, but then you say if I start with knowlegde I
won't get anywhere. How did I get the knowledge in the latter example if
I did not first care for truth? It doesn't really matter ...

Knowledge is limited to things we can think. I am intrested in a MUCH
BROADER spectrum of consciousness which includes emotions. I will call
this broader spectrum "information". I do not feel the term information
limits me to the purely cognitive that epistemology does. When you are
focused on truth and knowledge alone, you deny the greater portion of
your consciousness. Its like looking through a little peep hole on
reality without ever feeling its presence.


Shifts and expansions in priority:

Epistemology --> Axiology and Aesthetics
Truth        --> Usefulness/functionality
False        --> Unuseful/nonfuntional
Knowlege     --> Information (the entire continuum of
consciousness,                     including the subconscious and the
emotions)
Honesty      --> Honesty (in terms of usefulness rather than truth)
Objectivity  --> The objective-subjective continuum
Exogenous reality --> The exogenous-endogenous reality continuum


I particularly appreciate your criticism and our discussion in general
Reilly. It helps me greatly to refine, modify, and more effectively
express my own thoughts on this matter. Thank you. I am finding our
dialogue extremely useful.

Reilly's invocation of Gilson strikes me as odd in the extreme.  Gilson is a
Catholic Aristotelian in the Thomist tradition.  BTW, I take it that
Gregory's use of `ontotheological' reflects the influence of Heidegger or
perhaps Derrida?  I raise these perhaps pedantic-seeming points because I
consider issues of filiation extremely useful, if only as range-finding
devices in such discussions.

Though it is difficult to see out of context, the quote above was a
rhetorical question, but I appreciate your response none the less.

So we are saying one thing, but we means something *slightly* different.
This is one of my difficulties with the term truth, by definition it
does not include this element of conjecture or skepticism. By definition
it is absolute, and not particularly questionable. Do you not imagine
that we might come up with a better term for what we are talking about.
One which is a bit more accurate or *true* [to use the term loosely].
The dictionary definition of truth is not entirely consistent with the
manner in which it is being used by science. Would it not make more
sense to create a more accurate word ... and then while doing so,
questioning all the priorities which truth and the new word both entail.

I like the word conjecture. It is derived from "com" which means
"together", and "jacere" which means "to throw"; to throw together. The
term conjecture seems much more dynamic than that of truth, which seems
extremely static. Perhaps the word "conjection" would be more suitable.

con-jec-tion n. something thrown together or conjectured in an attempt
to contextually accord with reality.     

con-jec-tive n. the degree to which a conjection accords with reality
compared to, or relative to, another conjection. adj. when stating that
one conjection is more or less so than another.

See now, where it sounds silly to talk about arriving at a more true
truth, it is very natural to speak of a more useful or conjective
conjection, e.g., ... 

Newton's truth is not as accurate or useful as Einstein's truth", versus
Newton's conjection is not as accurate or useful as Einstein's
conjection.

Instead of seeking truth or ultimate truth, we seek metaconjection, a
better conjection than the one we have now.

Unlike the term true, conjective does not have an opposite, it is
specifically a continuum of degrees. Something can be said to have 0
degrees of or very little conjective, but cannot be said to be
nonconjective, for it is conjective, it is just 0 degrees conjective.
This keeps the emphasis on the greyscale rather on something simply
black or white.

Conjection is a synthesis and refinement of the terms "truth" and
"theory". Conjective is a response to the true-false dichotomy. Thus
instead of saying that a theory is either true or false, we could say
that a conjection is more or less conjective.

Where truth is a statement of relation to reality alone, conjective is a
statement of relation to both reality and to other conjections. Thus
conjectively, a conjection is intrinsically open to criticism. Its
degree of conjection will be lessoned if a better conjection is "thrown
together."

I believe these terms or terms created with similar meaning, would be
more suitable to PCR. 

I don't expect anyone to take this whole conjection/conjective thing too
seriously, but it illustrates a problem and the beginnings of a
solution. For several reasons, some mentioned above, the term "truth" is
not wholly appropriate to our use of it. I believe the term is
inhibitory in one sense due to its bias on a specific modality of
consciousness, and inhibitory in another sense due to its static nature,
and its reference to reality without relation to anything else. 
Reality changes, there is no absolute reality, so how could there be an
absolute truth. How can we seek absolute truth, something that is
suppose to accord with reality, when reality itself is not absolute and
unchanging. I believe this problem can be solved by more refined, more
appropriate and thus *useful* terminology.

Our theoris progress, shouldn't our terminology also?  

Perhaps the term truth is not yet archaic or obsolete, but I imagine it
will one day be so. It merely requires that enough people find it
neccessary for more *useful* terminology. 

I'm not sure how exactly this relates, call it an intuitive addition.
But I recall someone mentioning once how a surfer can recognize between
twenty or more different kinds of waves, whereas when I look out at the
ocean, I just see big or small waves [I live in the midwest so I don't
see the ocean or waves often]. I guess I'm proposing in a sense that we
begin to differentiate truth by creating more accurate and less loaded
terms for it. Perhaps that wasn't a good metaphor, but heres another one
along the same lines. In the orient [and elsewhere] many people
generally recognize seven different chakras [some esoteric groups
differentiate between many more]. These chakras are intended to
represent states of consciousnes or modalities of consciousness. Compare
this to the three or so that we tend to focus on, rational [cognitive],
irrational [emotive], and non-rational [intuitive]. I think there is a
great deal of room here for some sophistication and greater sensibility.
Hitherto I have only been pushing for more balance between the three we
recognize, enhancing the emotive and intuitive, but then there are still
other modalities yet. They could all "prove" to be useful in some
fashion where science is concerned.   

If we do not have language for something, we might not even recognize
it. There is a great deal of literature on how our language shapes our
perception of reality. I do not believe arguments of semantics and
semiotics are wasted time. Isn't this one of the key elements of
memetics?

Yes, both were early influences, Heidegger much more so than Derrida. I
certainly have vestiges of both lingering within me. I imagine however
that I am influenced in some fashion by everything and everyone I read,
be it by questioning and accepting parts, or questioning and finding
alternatives to parts, or by taking disparate elements between what I
have read and trying to create a "transcending" synthesis. The idea of
sythesis comes from Hegel, though he believed that synthesis would
finally lead to Ultimate Truth or a knowledge of Ultimate Reality. So
here I employ Hegel's idea of synthesis without particularly subscribing
to his loftier beliefs regarding it. We tend to think of influences as
that which we have most embraced, but I would also consider myself
highly influenced by people such as Plato due to the depth of my
disagreement with their thought.   

For those not familiar with the term, 'ontotheological' was used to
illustrate how preceeding philosophers (continental philosophers such as
Hegel in particular) attempting to remove God from philosophy, had
merely renamed him in various ways. Hegel of course did this by
replacing God with Ultimate Truth.

Since i came in contact with Transhuman and Extropian thought, the main
problem i had in assimilating Participant Evolutionist theory into it, has
without doubt been the eternal life question.

Although seeking eternal life is a fine example of the individual seeking
to escape the rules Nature has imposed upon humanity, and thus increasing
the individuals control over his/her own destiny, i still have a few
problems with some other possible motive.

The quest for eternal life could also come from the natural instinct to
stay alive no matter what. This i.m.o. is a very dangerous motive. As ones
life itself is valued as the greatest possible good, many other aspects
that are assumed to be naturally 'inherent' to that life, are taken for
granted, and i hope we will not forget to improve the quality of that life,
in the process of trying to extend it.

To quote Aristotle: 'Certainly most men, in their desire to keep alive, are
prepared to face a great deal of suffering, as if finding in life itself a
certain well-being and a natural sweetness'

0r a more radical one: 'Life has no ideals, it will do anything to survive
!' (Arthur Byron Cover)

Certainly there is truth in these words. When life itself is valued as the
highest ideal, other ideals become secondary to it, and there might lie the
basis for the success of the many opressive state systems we disussed in
earlier threads.


Self-sacrifice ethic.

Now to continue where i left off in the socialist/capitalist discussion, i
do see where ethics like that of self-sacrifice (understood that it's
voluntary, and based on individual decisions), and that of 'the good of the
many' etc, cannot be ignored in any rational system, nor should such ethics
become valued as 'inferior' or 'obsolete'. Something to which i still have
questions after the reactions on the last discussion.

No political system can function without ideals and ethics that function
like 'unwritten laws' by which a society lives together. 

My question then is: If in an anarcho-capitalist system, this main ideal
becomes 'survival', then is there not the danger of it becoming the same
hell to live in, as many of the other political systems we reject ? 

Are we then not simply replacing the exploitative system of a state or
ruling power, by a system where we exploit eachothers fears of death, and
desires for survival ? Or indeed our desires for accumulation of wealth to
insure those...

I myself have had no fear of death yet, and the only reason for myself i
can imagine would be, if one day i would start a family, for whom i need to
be 'around'. I find it hard to understand why anyone would stay alive for
selfish reasons, but i assume there are many who would. 

My personal reason for striving towards a posthuman state is to eliminate
the 'control' nature imposes on the living individual. To put that control
(over my life, death, emotions) more into the hands of the individual.

Maybe this clarifies my personal vision on some subjects we discussed.

Any comments ?

Subject: BoS:  48 bit challenge broken

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

13 February 1997

Local contact: Germano Caronni, gec@acm.org
[This press release originated from Melanie Harper]

THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS JOIN TO CRACK THE HARDEST CRYPTOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE
EVER


Loosely organized international group checks a record 162082778549251
keys in 13 days to find correct solution


ZURICH: More than 5000 computers connected via the Internet have broken the
most difficult cryptographic challenge ever solved, in just over thirteen
days. The challenge was one of a series of cryptographic challenges recently
offered by RSA Data Security, Inc., a U.S. firm which produces cryptographic
software.  

The Internet group's successful attempt on the challenge, which is the
second record-breaking cryptographic challenge solution within the last two
weeks, demonstrates in a dramatic fashion that many encryption systems -- such
as those commonly used on the Internet, in electronic commerce, and in
so-called "Smart Cards" -- can be broken with relative ease using modern
computing techniques.

The challenge was solved by a loosely organized group of individuals from
around the world who banded together to create a project known as the
"Distributed Internet Crack." The group was begun by Germano Caronni,
member at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and quickly 
grew to include hundreds of people, from commercial as well as academic
sites, who worked at a furious pace to write and optimize the necessary
software and then run it on thousands of computers simultaneously. The
group never met in person but communicated via email.  Continuously
updated pages on the World-wide Web, available in four different
languages, provided the latest information and progress reports.

The Distributed Internet Crack first attacked the easiest of RSA's
challenges.  The group solved this challenge in 3 1/2 hours, only minutes
after another group submitted the correct answer.  After coming so close to
winning the first challenge, the group decided to take on the second one,
hundreds of times as difficult.  The challenge required that up to
281474976710656 different keys be checked.

By putting the power of thousands of powerful and not-so-powerful computers
together via the internet, the second challenge was solved on Monday,
February 10th, a little over thirteen days after it was issued.

The successful completion of the challenge broke new ground in several ways:
Besides cracking the hardest key ever, the event also brought together the
most computers ever working on a single Internet project (over 5500 computers
were operating simultaneously at one point, and over 10,000 computers joined
in the project at one time or another), and produced the most cryptographic
keys ever checked per second in an openly publicized effort (over 440
million keys per second at peak, and an average of 140 million keys per
second over the entire project).

If the group would have re-attacked the 40 bit challenge with the computing
power it had at the end of this effort, that key would have been broken
within 45 minutes.

The group is now planning to attempt another challenge issued by RSA, this
time aimed at the DES cipher, which has been used in American and other
financial institutions for many years.

I think you raise a valid point -- many Extropians oppose the naturalistic
fallacy ("it's natural, so it must be good"), and rightly so in my opinion.
However, it may be that we commit at least one instance of it by assuming
that life (or at least, *our* lives, are worth preserving -- we're
pandering to the survival instinct ;->

But isn't wanting to "stay around" to look after one's family  firmly in
line with what Nature (our genes) want us to do?

For me, much of life's attraction stems from the belief that the universe
can be a wonderful place to experience and interact with. Is this selfish,
in the bad sense of the word?  Possibly, but I figure much of the
accusations of "selfishness" directed at people who want to extend their
life spans stem from the naturalistic fallacy. We're accustomed to a ~100
year life-span being "natural", and attempts to exceed that may rankle
(some people, definitely not me!). But this is just an artifact of our
genetic programming: few would argue that a 50 year-old who has raised
his/her children to maturity is selfish for wanting to live another 30 odd
years. Similarly, if the maximum human lifespan were 500 years, those who
committed suicide at age 300 so as "not to be selfish" would probably be
seen as very odd indeed.

That being said, if I were some sort of vampire-like creature that had to
kill or hurt innocent people in order to survive, then accusations of
selfishness would be better-founded. But if someone continues to interact
with others in a manner that is acceptable to those involved, why shouldn't
they be able to strive for an indefinite life span?

>>My personal reason for striving towards a posthuman state is to eliminate

I agree completely.

That was just one small example. The point is that there is no general method 
to know if ANY computer program will ever stop.

How is it right? It did not predict that I would look at the box, but I did,  
and all the predictions it made about me after that point are wrong.
            

        >The prediction was of what you would do given situation X.  When you         
        >do something different, you are not in situation X, but situation Y,

Exactly. My situation at X includes the prediction of what the magic box says  
I will do, so for the magic box to predict what I will do it must also  
predict what it will do. We need a super magic box for that.

I think that we could both agree that a person is a being and a rock is not, 
but the dividing line between those two extremes is rather blurry and  
arbitrary. I never claimed to have a good definition of "a being". 
My intuition tells me that such a simple program is not a being, but if you 
insist it is then I would have to say it has free will.
            

        >If you had a box which had a simulation of your mind which ran 
        >faster than your own, then you could always find out what you were 
        >going to do before you did it.  


No you could not.  If you look at the box's prediction then you and the box  
would be part of the same system and no system in general can predict what  
it will do next. For example, just do the opposite of what the box predicts.
   
The bottom line is that regardless of how fast this box can emulate a brain 
it would be completely unable to accurately tell you what you will be doing 
in 10 minutes. It could however be able to accurately tell me what you will 
decide to do next and it could accurately tell you what I will decide to do 
next. According to my definition we would both have free will.
            

        >Would the existence of such a box make you doubt your own free will?  

No.
            
        >Wouldn't it be strange to always have this box around which knew         
        >exactly what you were going to do ahead of time?


The correct predictions the box made would not seem strange to me because I 
didn't see them. The prediction about me that I did see would not seem 
strange because they were wrong. I still feel free.

"Providing access to content is not sufficient to guarentee effective
message passing. A message delivered but ignored, or a message ingested
but not digested, is not useful. In order to inform, the "recipient"
must find the message content engaging and relevant. It is the
contention of the News in the Future group at MIT Media Labatory that
effective communication requires distribution of messages that are rich
in description. These descriptions, when taken with consideration of the
context of both the individiduals and the communities recieving them,
can result in messages that are both engaging and useful." [W. Bender,
opening to his article, "Community and Personalization", from the IBM
Systems Journal, Vol35, Nos.3&4, 1996] 

There has been some recent debate on this Elist concerning cookies. One
extreme is to turn them off [for the sake privacy] so your browser does
not accept them. However, I'd like to propose the *choice* or *option*
to take something of the opposite extreme, a meta-cookie.

I would like the internet and specifically the content of the internet,
to attempt to adapt to me. In order for it to do this, I must have a
standard though revisable description of myself available to any server
I browse to. I would call this a meta-cookie. The meta-cookie would
enable content providers to make the content I recieve more "engaging
and useful". I want the Internet to adapt, at least in a temporal
fashion, to my presence.  

The meta-cookie could have general information such as name, preferred
alias, age, sex, race, locality, interests, favorite colour,
myers-briggs result, education, fixations and perversions, etcetera,
etcetera. As we begin to understand the science of personalization
better, future versions of the meta-cookie could have more useful
variables.

I don't particularly care what people know about me. As far as I'm
concerned the more the better. The only illegal thing I do is use
lysergic acid diethylamide-25. And since I do not consider my use of it
a criminal activity [though the governement and many individuals do],
I'm not about to hide the fact. If some one can use this information to
incremenate me, good. That gives me the opportunity to stand up for my
belief in Freedom of Consciousness. Often the legalization of something
requires that first people be arrrested for doing it, and then
attempting to show how the law is unconstitutional. Now I do not want to
suggest that I know a great deal about the legal system, but my main
point is that I'm not concerned with people knowing what I do or say, be
it taboo, perverse, illegal, revolutionary, or otherwise.

I think this over concern for encryption and privacy only hinders ideas
such as personalization. Perhaps I share the hacker ethic [see the
hacker manifesto], that all information should be available in the open.
I'm not too pleased with the idea that my governement hides information
from me in the name of "national security* while it continues to play
primitive war games with other nations.

I believe the use of encryption is like trying to cure a symptom rather
than the problem. It seems superficially western within a medical
analogy. Perhaps we should attempt to reform government and society so
that we do not feel such a need for encryption and information privacy.  
Fantasizing for a moment, I think it would be nice if one day we created
the technology that allowed us to read each other's minds. I don't care
if someone knows what I'm thinking. It would certainly make games like
poker fairly obsolete, but it would improve communication considerably.

On the topic of the meta-cookie. Such information would certainly make
it possible for prejudice and selected information withholding. Fine,
thats what I want. Thats part of personalization. If I go to a site, and
it doesn't offer me information on such and such because my favortie
song is, "The Purple People Eater", then thats fine. If I really want
the information, I can turn off my meta-cookie and return to the site,
or I could even rewrite my meta-cookie so that it would be found
appealing to the site I'm browsing to.

I like the meta-cookie idea better than having to time and time again
type my personal info in for sites. The meta-cookie would facillitate
filling out forms, the site already has access to your general
information, while facillitating also the creation of more site-specific
cookies. 

In general I believe cookies are going to facillitate a major evolution
in education. Education is going to become more and more so
personalized, less authoritarian. 

I think I will go make my suggestion to Netscape and Microsoft now.

Cheers,

I don't see any French guys on that list, Reilly. I could name a
whole bunch more sources, too. If I were to generalize about it,
I'd have to go along with Hayek that the "intellectual current"
responsible for our sorry political situation is
constructivist-rationalism, the idea that authorities can be trusted
to run society, that individuals are required to figure out what
other people are supposed to do. Not only is that a very old and
pervasive intellectual current, but it also happens to be one that
I think many of the current French poststructuralists are fairly
careful to eschew.

But we need to keep in mind that all such attempts to trace
intellectual currents in history and pin responsibility on them
are examples of collectivist thinking, and that collectivist thinking
is often misleading. If you are a lover of liberty, you believe in
free speech, and it seems strange to me for a believer in free
speech to blame the wielder of the pen and not the wielder of the
sword. Especially when you are such an active pen-wielder yourself.

And finally, it's my opinion that the current crop of French
poststructuralists are neither very original nor very interesting.
The best of them are just riffing off of Nietzsche, so you might
as well blame him. But that's been done to death, which is, I guess,
the reason why you've moved on to abusing the French.

        weapons fanatics.
        
        If I recall right, the good guys helped install a broach, with 
        the help of Vaughn Meiss (get it, von Mises...) on the bad 
        earth.  But later on an accident occurred when Win Bear went 
        through the broach--some guy got caught in it and it caused a 
        big explosion on the other side (the bad earth side).  They 
        admitted that if more of the guy's mass had been on the other 
        side of the broach, the entire city or country could have been 
        blown up.  Where is the responsibility here?  Is this itself 
        not an act of aggression against all the bad-earth Americans 
        who were almost killed due to a scientific experiment of the 
        good guys?
        
        The implausibility of the history:  even if Jefferson had been 
        able to abolish slavery, it is my understanding that he wanted 
        to ship the blacks to Africa to avoid racial conflict etc., 
        since he thought the blacks inferior and that they would never 
        be able to live in harmony with whites.  Apparently, after 
        Jefferson freed the slaves, they were allowed to stay.  But 
        this is admittedly a pretty minor matter.
        
        I also thought Smith's list of presidents interesting--Rand, 
        Spooner, Hospers, etc., but very unrealistic, since most of 
        these people were thinkers but not necessarily political 
        leaders.

This is all very hypothetical so it is hard to say how it might work.
If we take your first alternative, that you don't have access to your
own memories and feelings while reading someone else's mind, I don't
see why it would follow that you would have trouble remembering the
experience afterwards.  I may undergo some experience and not access my
memories during it, but that doesn't make it hard for me to remember it
afterwards.

I think you are right that in the second case, you would have a less
accurate picture of the other person's feelings, since your own reactions
might be confused with his.  However presumably with practice you could
learn to disentangle the two more easily.

Sometimes after an intense dream I awaken, and for a few moments it is
hard to reconcile the memories from the dream (which sometimes include
events which supposedly took place before the dream began) with my
real memories.  Maybe this experience would be similar to merging two
disjoint sets of memories as you describe.

 Browsers already store your network preferences.
More complex, structured profile, with personal descriptions and
preferences and rules of sharing them, as well as intelligent software
that makes use of them for your benefit, are exactly what we are doing
at Firefly now - and other companies are entering the space as well -
under the names of software agents, ACF, etc.
 It sure is a promising field.

You're probably right that some "Type A" personalities who already spend 
most of their waking hours working to get ahead would simply extend those 
hours to fill the remainder of the day.  Which might cause many of the 
rest of us to follow along in an attempt to keep up.  But the big 
difference, in my opinion, is that at that point a person's decision to 
work longer hours would be voluntary.  Right now, by contrast, I have no 
choice but to spend a third of my life in a useless dormant state.

I think you're definitely onto something here.

For me, dreaming is usually a fairly disembodied experience, in the 
sense that even when dreaming of movement I can usually ignore bodily 
mechanisms involved (gravity and balance don't seem to be important). 
 It's also primarily a subjective flow of sensation or communication, 
certainly without alot of planning or reflection (though the times 
when I notice these activities are very interesting). Usually the most 
intriguing parts of the dream are the strange feelings and the odd 
events or environments being witnessed.

In other words, the dreaming state may be a very useful model for what 
it might be like if we could tap into another person's mind - or if we 
were receiving sensations from multiple robotic agents or virtual 
selves on the Net.

I also notice that there is a mechanism in my mind, rarely under 
normal conscious control, though somehow exercisable, by which my 
regular waking minds recall dreams - sometimes the dreams are 'right 
there' and it's trivial to recall them; other times I have to make a 
concerted effort to find a thread that will lead me back into the 
series of dream events. Sort of a hashing and thrashing exercise, 
between trying to avoid immediate flushing of the dream registers, 
ignoring the stack of day-ahead planning thoughts my rational mind is 
starting to pop, while still retaining the intentional and analytical 
capabilities of the wakened mind.

Whatever this dream-recall mechanism is, some analogue of it is likely 
to be an essential, controllable skill for integrating 
sub-personalities as an upload, for being able to navigate during 
intense VR immersion, or for maintaining identity during the kind of 
mind-to-mind linking you were describing.

I was soliciting comments on the design /before/ putting it in
place, but you're probably right that it would be better to just
do it and get comments afterward.  It will be on my usual pages
at Piclab, probably by Monday night.

I think the confusion lies in thinking that the definition of truth
gives us some understanding of how to test for truth.  As I said above,
it does nothing of the kind.  We test for truth by more or less
pragmatic or Popperian methods.  The definition of truth stipulates an
*ideal* scenario.  It defines what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get
there.  (That much of the hullaballoo against truth this century is
correct. But to ditch truth as a concept, an ideal, is to throw the baby
out with the bathwater.)

Conjecture and truth are not in competition: everything that we have
that we *call* truth we *conjecture* to be truth in the ideal sense.  I
really don't see what's so difficult or problematic about this.

It just seems to me that the concept of truth is precisely the most
useful concept we have: it tells us what we're aiming *for*, as opposed
to what we've *got*, which is what you're talking about, I think.

What you are talking about, with your waves example (and such things as
the the traditional
Eskimo's snow example, which was recently and amusingly discussed here)
is, I believe, this: there are many different ways of being interested
in things, and these different ways of being interested in things will
prompt us to ask different questions, with different levels of focus on
reality.  But if I, with my meager knowledge of waves ask "is that an x
wave or a y wave?" that question can be answered truly or falsely; and
if a wave-expert asks "is that an x1, y, alpha, gamma or epsilon wave?"
that question can be answered truly or falsely.

As much as I am tempted to simply give up and tell you to read
Friedman (you don't even have to buy a book--just go browse around
http://www.best.com/~ddfr/), I simply must call your bluff here.

Why do you and other collectivists in one breath praise the value
of others, and in the next breath claim that seeking your selfish
interest would harm others?  That's a plain contradiction.  Other
people are valuable to me; I cannot achieve my selfish goals without
the cooperation and interaction of others.  Why do you refuse to
listen to your own words?

The morally bankrupt ideas of self-sacrifice are an intellectual
pathology, a mystical belief that life is a zero-sum game, and that
seeking your own interest necessarily harms others.  Give it up.
Look at the facts in front of you: other people are a positive
benefit to me /as a selfish individual/, and I will therefore act
in my selfish interest to maximize their benefit to me.  The best
way to do that is to encourage specialization, so that each can do
what he does best, and free trade, so that each of us (not all,
each) can most benefit from it.

Not only /can/ "the good of the many" be ignored in a rational
system, it /must/ be.  It, like democracy, is a pretty idea that
can only produce misery in the long run, by mechanisms well known
and clearly evidenced over the ages.  There are only two ways for
all human interaction to take place: by unanimous consent, or by
force.  Any attempt to place value on "society" or "the many" or
"the majority" or anything else but individual self-interest will
inevitably require the use of force, and is doomed to failure.

oh sure, it was just the only reason i could imagine. I'm however still
young and i suppose at a certain age, when one has learned how to deal with
things such as emotions more effectively, and once one has aquired oneself
a comfortable position, life clears up a little ? and becomes worth
preserving ?

Oh i don't think so, if life itself is good, then wanting to preserve it is
quite rational. Question is, is life good ? Something that can only be
answered by the individual. To me personally, life isn't all that i've been
told it was, but then again at least it is something, whereas in death
there lies nothing, very unpractical... :-)

I know many who would argue, saying that such people would have lost their
productive function to society, and have become, to use some negative term
'social parasites'. Most of these people are my age, and i watch as their
numbers grow. I acknowledge the problem they point out, however i haven't
come across a sensible solution...  

This is why i pointed out we might better focus on quality of life, and
with that, the possibility for people to provide for themselves longer,
before we start talking about increasing lifespans, less we want it to only
be for a select few, or less society gets to carry the increasing burden of
humanities desire for eternal life...

>That being said, if I were some sort of vampire-like creature that had to

What about pensions, state funded health care etc ? The real problem is
that the idea of eternal life, is so strongly rooted in our culture, that
it might well be accepted as a basic human right. With which i don't have a
problem, as long as its not going over the backs of those that are (still)
productive.

>But if someone continues to interact

As i said, i see a big change in young peoples attitudes towards the
elderly taking place. (of which i have to admit i am no exception) Maybe it
is a conflict of selfishness between generations...   

Whereas i agree with the ideal that everyone who would wish to, should be
able to live forever, the person in question should also carry the
responsability and costs of such a decision.

Something that goes much further in scope than i think most people imagine.

This discussion took a direction, i din't really want to see it taking (at
least not yet), but i guess it was unavoidable, as it is one of the other
problems i have with life extension. 

My views on this are that life extension cannot go without social change,
and whereas i'm sure most of you will agree with me in that, i'm also
pretty sure that such a social change will take a little longer than
possible breakthroughs in life extension, which has been an ongoing process
for some time i think...

Who knows, maybe one will be the catalyst for the other ?

I am in complete agreement with you, and I should hope that this
would make it clearer to you why so many of us here are radical
libertarians.

Damien Broderick wrote 2/13/97: <Reilly's invocation of Gilson strikes me
as odd in the extreme.  Gilson is a Catholic Aristotelian in the Thomist
tradition.  BTW, I take it that Gregory's use of `ontotheological' reflects
the influence of Heidegger or perhaps Derrida?>

Odd in what way I wonder?  Perhaps odd because I'm quoting a Frenchman?  (I
won't use your term invocation here because Gregory may get confused and
think I'm guilty of liturgical cognition or some such horrible thought
crime.)  Well, I do want to be fair to the French, and if some of them come
up with a correct analysis, I will not look askance.  I find Gilson's
comment about Heidegger and his fellow-traveler crudballs to be
particularly apt:  "Philosophy always buries its undertakers."

Although the "bad" Frenchman Gilles Deleuze is not in the same intellectual
league with "good" Frenchmen like Montaigne, Pascal, Montesquieu, Condorcet
or DeTocqueville, I would even quote him if could analyze his way out of a
paper bag.  In fact, I will quote him on something reasonably truthful,
I'll just wash my hands after I type this:  

"It is precisely its impotence that makes power so dangerous.  This,
precisely, is the fourth danger:  the line of flight crossing the wall,
getting out of the black holes, but instead of connecting with other lines
and each time augmenting its valence, *turning to destruction, abolition
pure and simple, the passion of abolition*." - from "Capitalism and
Schizophrenia" Vol. II

The reason power is always impotent is because power cannot answer the
question "Power to do what?"  The passionate capacity for entropic
death-worshipping is in us, and will be in our successors (if they are
higher, rather than lower, on the evolutionary scale).  It is a choice open
to beings with free will, inherent in the design of things.  There will
always be entities who will choose it, simply to exercise their free will,
to show others their independence if for no other reason.

Gregory has whined utopically about how bad it is to develop violent
technology:  <I believe violence in general, and specifically science for
the purpose of violence would be greatly reduced if we included emotive
education in our schools.> and <Though the person focused on truth can
rationalize violence as irrational, that person is more likely to be
violent and to participate in the creation of violent technology because
that person does not have the same control over his/her emotions as the
person focused on usefulness.>

The act of turning towards extropy or turning towards entropy is a moral
absolute.  Those who have turned towards extropy, or the culture of life,
must defend themselves from those who have turned towards entropy, or the
culture of death.  An entirely extropic vocation is to specialize in
development of superior violent technology to prohibitively raise the cost
of action to those who would destroy what one loves.  For a modern course
in what prevents war, see John Keegan's "A History of Warfare" (1993). 
"Peace Through Strength" is a better bumper sticker than "Visualize World
Peace."  Letting those with a "passion for abolition" have their way with
you by renouncing the development of violent technology coupled with the
shown will to employ it, is to be co-opted by the entropic
death-worshippers by default.  It would not be, shall we say, rational.

As Matthew Sciabarra tried to point out in his excellent recent book, "Ayn
Rand, Russian Radical," such societies as you have referenced will only work
if all major players are "moral" in the sense proposed by Ms. Rand.  As all
persons who have had to serve as legal representatives of others know, pigs
will fly before a majority of people are "moral" in the sense that Ms. Rand
proposed.  Thus, as you point out, such anarcho-capitalist societies as you
have referenced will deginerate into the war of all against all.

This is great. I have a suggestion. Imagine a ticker tape cgi program
that the user can customize at some particular webpage by entering
fields of interests, people of interest, business's and organizations of
interest, etcetera. The ticker tape would then be constantly updated
with information regarding late breaking news on these subjects.
Clicking on the subject in the ticker tape would take you to that
information. Once the ticker tape has been defined, the person can put
it at the top of their home page so that every time they log on its
immiediately accessed. Putting the ticker tape on the home page would be
done in the same way many people put counters on their homepages by
accessing the cgi program on other servers, in this case the server
running the ticker tape. Then specialized sites could use this ticker
tape on their web pages also by defining the subjects of interest for
that site specifically. A nanotechnology site for instance would have a
ticker tape at the top [or elsewhere] with late breaking news dealing
with nanotechnology and related science. New news would knock off old
news so that even if there hasn't been anything new, there will still be
a set number of ticker tape items scrolling across this small and
unobtrusive html embedded cgi object. 

I would suggest a hyperlinked table of contents on your essay for ease
of reference.

I am particularly intrested in microcosmic automated collaborative
filtering (ATF). How can I apply this emerging technology within my
website as well as beyond it? 

In the essay, located in the URL of your sig text, it said,
"Explanations of the workings of the technology and
analysis of the current market are not my purpose here [...]". I would
be interested in an article that did delve into the technology a bit.
I'd like to know how this is to be implemented. Will it be in the
browser, or will it be cgi, or something else. Again, I would like to
see how I could use perhaps stripped down, stream-lined, less complex
ATFs on my own site. Something easily implented using JavaScript, CGI,
or ActiveX.

"The problem here is that while machines store and pass messages, they
do not know what to store and where to pass it. So,
they process everything." [ATF article]

This topic is covered a great deal in the IBM Systems Journal Vol. 35,
Nos 3&4, 1996. This particular issue of the journal is focused on the
MIT Media Lab. A highly recommended read. 


"Some caveats exist here as well. If a people's expertise and tastes in
some area are underdeveloped, a straightforward ACF system might provide
them with the advice of their "laggard" affinity group that may give
them support but not help in developing beyond their current level."
[ATF article]

Wonderful. This would be particularly useful for personalized online
education [which one day might usurp traditional public education], and
for Elists such as this which cover such varied topics. You mention
"support but not help" here, but I think such a system could be
assimilated into a personalized school curriculum so that the individual
could attain degrees of both. In such a system the human teachers role
becomes referential rather than authoritarian. Student phone call or
email to teacher: "I have studied such and such information that my ATF
has recommended yet I still am unable to understand this concept. Could
you please help me." The ATF might even recommend someone to else to
contact within the instituition, perhaps beyond it, who is more
knowlegeable in this topic than the teacher/advisor.


"The applications mentioned above move beyond mere information
filtering." [ATF article]

I tend to bring up issues involving the emotions and the subconscious as
often as I can. In this case I think it might be interesting if
personalized real-time memetic engineered subliminals might be added to
a person's content based on their preferences, restrictions, habits, and
aspirations. This would broaden the relevant effectual/affectual range
of particular ATFs. ATFs already nudge us towards information at the
conscious level, why not take it a step further so that they nudge and
even help motivate us towards information and particular modalities of
consciousness.

What other "solution" to such hideous ideas could there be, other than
to fight them with good ideas?  Ideas like personal responsibility,
voluntary compassion, and individual liberty can be spread sucessfully
if we recognize and fight their enemies: social responsibility, duty,
and democracy.

Strange. I thought that societies such as our current one will only
work if all major politicians are "moral" in an even more exacting
sense. In seems to me that we are already living in a war of all
against all, with everyone trying to vote himself shares of his
neighbor's wallet.

Also, I think Randian morality has already become a tiny bit
old-fashioned. What do you have to say about the theories of morality
presented by David D. Friedman? You could try referencing:

	http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Virtue1.html

and most particularly:

	http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Virtue2.html

and let us know how Sciabarra's arguments hold up in the light of
Friedman's.

I wasn't praising the value of others, nor was i saying that seeking self
interest hurts others *by definition*, just that it can in some cases, as a
matter of fact, i agreed with everything you said on this, but it wasn't
very specific, as to where you saw contradictions to it in what i wrote...

here's where i disagree, and like to point out that you yourself said you
can't pursue your opwn self interest without others, so up to some point
the good of the many is inherent to the good of the individual (& vice
versa!!!). There are situations where the good of the many limits the good
of the individual, but i believe there are also situations where the
opposite CAN be the case. Why is striving for a system where both
situations are minimalized so bad ?

Oh and don't worry, Friedman and Hayek are next on my list of purchases,
but as i said before, reading them will probably only increase my postings
on the subject...

Obviously you need to put a dollar sign on the intangible value of
staying alive. Perhaps this is only an apparent change. You forgot to
include the gains due to collection of life insurance. Your market
basket death benefit will range from $10,000 up to $1,000,000. Once
again we are dealing with material goods rather than informational
goods, so its still out of the issue. 

Back to megs and bauds, you use Moore's laws to estimate what the
typical rate of consumption was for a given unit at a given point in
time. In 1990, 2400 baud modems were the norm, 18 months later, 4800,
then 9600 18 months after that, then onto 14.4, 28.8, and now 56k. Using
these rates of consumption, with the attendant cost per baud, you see
that there is significant deflation in high technolgies due to
technological advancement, and the synergies of feeding every new gain
into attaining greater gains, maintaining a 100% rate increase in
productivity every 18  months.

1990      2400baud /$200 = $.08/baud
1991.5    4800baud /$200 = $.04/baud
1993      9600baud /$200 = $.02/baud
1994     14,400baud /$200 = $.01333/baud
1995    19,600baud /$200 = $.01/baud
1996	28,800baud /$200 = $.00666/baud
1997	56,000baud /$200 = $.00333/baud

Given this unaccounted for deflation, it is easy to see why the only
thing contributing to inflation is COLA payments by the government union
and pension system that are based on false inflation data from the
government.

It is also easy to see why human productivity is increasing for the
first time in 30 years, graphical interfaces that are easy to use for
the majority of the population increase one's effective intelligence,
effectiveness, and overall productivity.

Are your superiors so incredulous or adamant against acknowledging the
validity of this deflation due to the fact that they are trying to
protect their pensions? Are they afraid that if they acknowledge that
there has been real deflation in the economy, that the people will
demand that they get their tax dollars back? If it is acknowledged that
there really isnt as much inflation as they claim, then the government
will not be able to jack up taxes, which is stupid, because if they drop
the inflation rate to its true level, our budget deficit problem will
dissapear within a few years as the interest payments we make on the
debt are lowered to compensate.

"The good of the many" is a rhetorical device much like "the selfish
gene", but neither exist as real things.  One can speak of the /results/
of evolution appearing /as if/ a gene were a volitional being, acting
for its own propogation, but no one (except perhaps Moravec:) suggests
that genes actually possess consciousness and volition.  Similarly, one
can speak of an action that benefits many people /as if/ it benefits
the group--but the reality is that a "group" has no mind to value things,
or to experience benefit.  Values imply a valuer, a volitional being.
Though I may use both of those rhetorical devices myself, I would no
sooner attribute values or rights to a group than I would to a gene.
It so happens that the /results/ of my selfish interest appear /as if/
I am benefiting the group--but that's just your mind's pattern-matching
machinery seeing something that isn't really there.

I'm hoping that someone can help me find an Esfandiary quote, from 
his book _Are You Transhuman?_  Evidently he never submitted it to 
the Library of Congress, and no other library around here can seem to 
find it.

Does anyone have access to this book?  I need a quote and a page 
number for a paper I have to complete this weekend.

Thank you so much for your help, in advance!

Best remove Foucalt from the title, then.  He isn't current 
(deceased), and he spent part of his career trying to get past Nietzche, 
which was difficult to accomplish given the politics of his period.

The above sounds more like a personal and verbally *violent* attack than
it does a rational argument. Replace the utopic thing with the extropian
concept of DYNAMIC OPTIMISM. No I do not believe we will always be
violent entities. The problem is once again in the lack of concern
people have for taking responsibility for their emotions. Most people
are unaware of the extent of their violent desires. Unaware of these
desires they are unable to *rationally* modify them. This issue has a
great deal less to do with morality than it does with psychology.
Morality is what the behaviorist sees on the surface, and from the
surface science attempts to treat the symptoms. We need to delve much
further into the psyche. Hitherto however science has completely lacked
the ability to work with such subjective [non-objective] matters. Thus
they are ignored entirely! Modern science attempts to rationalize the
subconscious away so that it does not have to deal with it.


> The act of turning towards extropy or turning towards entropy is a moral
> absolute.

A moral absolute? Ideally I'm sure, but how about in praxis. A person
can make a rational decision to keep a new years resolution, but if they
are unwilling to admit of their subconscious, and thus to create
techniques and technology for delving into it, that person may not be
able to keep that resolution do to the force of underlying,
unquestioned, subconscious emotions.

My interest in emotive responsibility and emotive concern in science is
not so that emotions take over, but just the very opposite. If we ignore
them then they control us without our being aware of it. Deny it and you
remain naive and determined.

No, by doing this you merely embrace the "culture of death" and become
one yourself. The extropian idea is ascension. Its about rising above
this primitive *rationality* of justifying violence and the appreciation
of violence and its tools.

Circles and cylces. Repetition. Perpetuation of the same old thing.
"I've got bigger balls than you do." This need to show others that we
are stronger is caused by excess dopamine in the central nervous system.
It is primitive. Our governent sells arms to third world countries. We
then wait for them to pick them up and use them so that we can have an
excuse to dominate someone else, thus showing our strength, while
justifying our ludicrous "defense" budget. Intresting how its called a
defense budget, with the bias on defense rather than offense. I think
thats memetic propoganda myself.


> For a modern course in what prevents war, [SNIP]

Prevent is not the right word here. Postpone is better. Its still a
competition. Two entities struggling to create more powerful tools of
desctruction. One day, one of the entities might just develop its
offenseive technology faster than the other entity develops its
defensive technology. At this point the *stronger* offensive country has
control to either manipulate or destroy the other country.  


Violence is perpetuated by an appreciation or desire for violence. You
cannot cease violence by being violent. You merely perpetuate the cycle.
How is that progressive? How is that rational? How is that extropian? 

Look at our entertainment industry. It is fueled by our appreciation of
violence. It is fueled by our fear, hatred, and paranoia.

You have been arguing with me about how you are completely aware of all
your emotions and their underlying motivations. Well, perhaps you should
check where some of your violent urges come from. I believe the desire
to do violence is a projection upon others one's desire to have violence
done to him/herself. People have violent urges when they feel insecure.
That insecurity comes from within and without. It comes from within when
a person is unappreciative of themself, when they feel inadequate,
unable to consciously bare the feeling that they want to die, they will
often express this in violent thought, or the appreciation of violence
in entertainment, and when taken to the extreme they will commit actual
acts of violence. From without it comes when one is threatened by the
other, but if one breaks down emotively and thus rationally and chooses
to persist in playing the violent game with the other, then that fear
and paranoia will be cultivated. If we did not always react to insecure
feelings with immidiate violent feelings, then we might just be able to
use that same reactive mental energy to focus on creating *progressive*
non-violent alternatives.

Both.  I agree that they are different.  But since they are both
evil, I don't spend much time cataloguing those differences.

Please name them, the more the merrier!

<But we need to keep in mind that all such attempts to trace intellectual

You lost me here.  Historians chronicling the progression of ideas from
individual to individual are all guilty of "collectivist thinking"? 
Perhaps you're confusing this work with "historicism," the attempt to sneak
determinism back into liberty-loving Western polities to subvert them. 
Attempts to merely trace intellectual currents and pin responsibility on
them for their consequences, good or bad, has nothing whatsoever to do with
"collectivist thinking."  It has to do with aiming at truth, and
highlighting cause-and-effect; answering the important question of what
ideas have worked and what ideas have not worked.  It is an individual
vocation undertaken seriously and responsibly.  History done by committee
or by "collectivist thinking" is more typified by the monocultural
group-think compost-modernists, aka 'revisionist' history.

<If you are a lover of liberty, you believe in free speech, and it seems
strange to me for a believer in free speech to blame the wielder of the pen
and not the wielder of the sword.>

It seems strange to me that you do not see that the wielders of the sword
are egged on and rationalized by the wielders of the pen.  If the pen is
mightier than the sword, shouldn't we aim at the pens (the ideas, of
course) that set up the moral and intellectual atmosphere for harmful
consequences to liberty-loving polities anywhere in order to counter them? 
Your position seems ostrich-like.

<And finally, it's my opinion that the current crop of French
poststructuralists are neither very original nor very interesting.>

I agree, radical skepticism is boringly repetitive historically, always
with the same harmful results fostered by the moral corrosion spread by it
in societies.  Yet here we are again, not learning from history.

<...you've moved on to abusing the French.>

Next you'll be calling me "mean-spirited."  I've been wary of the French
for a very long, long time.  But what really clinched it for me, was the
immortal words of the great philosopher Al Bundy, on a TV episode of
"Married... With Children" where Professor Bundy climbed down a mountain
with the modern version of the Ten Commandments etched on the back of a
guitar; he intoned the modern Second Commandment:  "It is wrong to be
French."  That did it for me, a total self-epiphany, the grok of ages,
absolute truth emanating from the boob tube, the most unlikely place I'd
have expected to find it.

Our theories progress towards what?  Where are they going?

<Perhaps the term truth is not yet archaic or obsolete, but I imagine it
will one day be so. It merely requires that enough people find it
neccessary for more *useful* terminology.>

Omega posted cogently a bit ago about willy-nilly redefinitions coming out
of the incoherent, passé, compost-modern stance that truth is either
relative or doesn't matter: "[H]aving an agreed upon meaning for words is
already a difficult enough problem in our society without people going
around redefining words on the fly.  ...[T]his kind of redefinition
[raises] the signal to noise ratio within our society's communication.... 
[T]he redefinition you espouse is being hyped by one very well defined and
fairly narrow segment of our culture to the detriment of the general
ability of our culture to communicate within itself."

<Your argument is that if I deny truth then I am embracing what is false.
This is not the case. This is the same sort of thinking that says if I
deny God, then I embrace satan.>

No, this is not the same thinking.  Truth is not relative, no matter how
hard many individuals today try to pretend it is in order to lie with
impunity.  Totally contradictory events do not occur simultaneously in the
exactly the same place; only one thing happens at a time, what actually
happens is true.  Only one thing at a time happened at each instant in the
past, each actually occurring instant is true.  Things that didn't happen,
or that aren't happening right now, are false.  The concepts of true and
false do not apply to future events; prediction, conjecture, promises and
the like do.  If you are going to embrace the idea that utterly
contradictory things occur in exactly the same place at exactly the same
time, down there at the microcausal or Planck moment level, then you can
say nothing logical at all.  You can only spout fluff, aka lies.  You can
speak to your relationship with Satan better than I can, so I'll leave that
to you.

<When I deny one pole of a dichotomy, I do not embrace its opposite. I deny
the dichotomy entirely.>

Whoop-de-do.  If you are not telling "the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth" about what has actually happened or what is actually
happening, you are lying.  Saying that utility is preferable to truth is an
open invitation to barbaric behavior.  It is quite frequently useful to
lie, does that alone make it right to lie?  With your cavalier disregard
for truth, I wouldn't like you in my jury box, on my witness stand, or
doing business with me.

<I can be honest without ever having to refer to the concept of truth...>

Honest?  How do I know you're telling me the truth?

<This is honesty qua usefulness rather than honesty qua truth. It still
works.>

I have seen quite clearly on the barbaric streets of many urban centers
that it most emphatically does not work.

<No one can be absolutely honest, but by degree, the person focused on
usefulness, will be more honest, more free, more in control of
self--emotively and thus cognitively--than the person focused on truth.>

I have been proud to know many individuals to be absolutely honest in many
situations.  Whatever sense you are using "absolutely" above, is useless to
me.  A focus on utility rather than on truth leads quickly to nihilistic
barbarism which produces only the illusion of self-control and freedom. 
The chaotic world outside that such a focus produces, severely limits the
courses of action open to you in favor of an over-concentration in your
time-energy budget on personal defense; and undercuts any incentive for
self-control to develop, in favor of attempting to appropriate whatever
appears to be useful to you at the moment.  The truth will set you free. 
Utility alone will enslave you; often without your recognition of the bars
surrounding you due to the self-delusion fostered by the turn away from
truth.

<If I am bored and useless its my own fault.>

Let's say you've been involved in an accident through no fault of your own,
or you've gotten very old and sick through no fault of your own, and you're
confined to a hospital bed, on life support, totally paralyzed but still
mentally functioning.  If you were bored and useless, it would not be your
fault.  This idea that your mental states or levels of functionality are
all your own fault is New Age religious claptrap, pure nonsense.

<Confusion has to do with knowledge, but what I am speaking about in this
example is about subconscious emotions that *we* are unaware of. Did you
deny that you have a subconscious? Are you completely aware of all that
motivates you?>

Confusion could have to do with knowledge, but more usefully, it has to do
with holding conflicting purposes in your consciousness.  Not conflicting
emotions, but the purposes that produced the emotions in conjunction with
the on-going actual events both inside and outside your head.  Emotions
don't conflict in the absence of purposes which, if achieved, would produce
conflicting actual events.  As far as I am aware, I am completely aware of
all that motivates me.  I deny that I have a subconscious that cannot be
made conscious by directing my attention appropriately.  This is just a
"spectrum of focus" issue, see David Gelernter's "Muse in the Machine"
(1993) on this idea.  Also, see John Searle's "The Rediscovery of the Mind"
(1993) for a conclusive refutation of the possibility of the existence of a
subconscious not accessible to the conscious mind.  Forget Freud, and all
his fellow-traveler crudballs.

<I am intrested in a MUCH BROADER spectrum of consciousness which includes
emotions. I will call this broader spectrum "information". I do not feel
the term information limits me to the purely cognitive that epistemology
does.>

You can call it "information" if you "feel" like it, but without
consciousness, who is the knower in conjunction with the known, that
actually makes it information?  Absent the conscious, subjective self,
please make a rational argument that information has any meaning at all.

<When you are focused on truth and knowledge alone, you deny the greater
portion of your consciousness. Its like looking through a little peep hole
on
reality without ever feeling its presence.>

You don't deny it, you just aren't using it at the moment.  Certainly there
other aspects of reality we can focus on that also use our consciousness,
we just are constrained by our attention mechanism from doing everything
possible at once.  None of us can ever look at more than a little peep hole
on reality no matter what we do, so what?

<Much of my confusion regarding your stand on emotive "intelligence" could
have been reduced if there were some extropian documents which made an
honest effort to deal with this issue.>

I touch quite a bit on emotive intelligence in my essay on "Consciousness",
Part I in "Extropy" #14 and Part II in "Extropy" #15.  Also, in my history
paper on the extropy web site under "Extro^2 Proceedings" you will find
quite a bit on it, even to the point of inextricably linking the concept of
progress to emotional meaning.  Also, see the "Extropian Art Manifesto" of
Natasha More's.  She writes: "We are achieving refined emotions through
forward thinking and analytical techniques."  To which I replied: "...A
lifting up - ascension - above the coarse fabric of today's orthodox
media-driven pop culture.  A simultaneous challenge to our maximum
emotional capacities coupled with an anchor in the aesthetic criteria of
what went before - we stand on shoulders of artistic genius, and we
simultaneously look upward and forward into new vistas; and downward and
backward with gratitude and a sense of measuring up to those whose vision
and sacrifice brought us to the present.  A rich and heady mix of emotions,
difficult to maintain, the 'liquid realm'."

<I am expressing a view that emotive issues are now "the great missing
piece in Extropian philosophy.">

Well, do your homework first before you express views like this.  Of
course, if you have no desire to attain truth, I guess you can express just
about any view you want to, but do they mean anything?

<Reality changes, there is no absolute reality, so how could there be an
absolute truth. How can we seek absolute truth, something that is suppose
to accord with reality, when reality itself is not absolute and
unchanging.>

What your confusion boils down to, is that your metaphysical presupposition
expressed above, your religious belief, if you will, or even worse, your
absolute truth, is unintelligible and incoherent.  This Heraclitean
idealism quickly falls off the cliff into the nihilistic abyss.  If you do
not begin with an aim to realism, your whole worldview stays vaporous,
unanchored to anything at all.

Gregory,

I think you are absolutely on the right lines with 'emotional intelligence',
if there is such a thing (and I think there is).

It is definitely true that there's a kind of art or technology out there,
perhaps not quite yet fully developed, but getting there, of  listening
to our emotions, and letting them say what they have to say.

But no marks for your anti-violence stuff.  Reilly wasn't glorifying or
rationalising vlolence, but the defensive use of force.  You like to be
pragmatic, but it is distinctly unpragmatic to roll over and play dead.

Sorry to play a two-cornered (three cornered?) game, but I just can't
let this past the censor.

The occuring events are neither true nor false, they just are the way
they are.  What we *say* about those occurring events is true or false,
objectively and eternally, because events go the way they go.

We use pragmatic methods because we are not really testing for truth but
rather for *practical* functionality.

I want to make an atom bomb. What matters is that it functions to
annihilate a large number of people while making there land useless.
While I am making my atom bomb, all that matters is that each part of it
is functional. Each part must do what I intend it to. I can create my
atom bomb without every worrying about the concept of truth. If
something does not function then I must figure out where the cause of
the dysfuntion lies and fix it so that it does function. I can throw the
immaculate child out with the bathwater and still create my bomb and
annhilate a great number of people. It still functions. Something works,
partially works, or it doesn't work. I don't have to invoke any such
concept as truth to deal with these matters.

Oh, I understand the concept quite clearly. I am only saying that the
concept is unnecessary and only serves to create particular bias', which
I have detailed exhaustively, which hinder the evolution of science as a
tool itself.

But sometimes we must complexify our theories in order to make them more
useful. We certainly want the fewest terms possible to serve our
purposes, but I believe that some of us are beginning to want more from
science than it is now capable. In order for it to become so, its
underlying concepts must evolve. Can you imagine something beyond
science as we know it today, or do you believe that we have attained the
ultimate tool. I'm fairly certain something lies beyond it. In order to
get there I am going to criticize science as it is today, while
attempting to find alternatives.

When we say that is an x1, y, or alpha wave, we are refering to an
arbitrary type. Part of the confusion is in believing that our arbitrary
deliniations are real. It would be more appropriate to say that this
wave FUNCTIONS as an x1 wave rather than this wave IS an x1 wave. For it
cannot BE an x1 wave. It can only functionally represent an the ideal of
an x1 wave. Do you see how truth confuses the issue, where functionality
is much more useful and rational? When we say this wave is an x1 wave we
are saying one thing yet meaning something *slightly* different, but if
I say that this wave functions as an x1 wave, then I am being much more
clear about what I mean.     

Are you familiar with the concepts of the signifier and signified, of
the difference between indexes, icons, and symbols? The concept of truth
confuses the distinction between these things. In the case above it
confuses the signifier symbol of x1 with the signified wave. They are
not the same.

I agree that it is not pragmatic to be a martyr, or otherwise and just
roll over and play dead. I do not imagine that we can end violence over
night, but I do think there are often non-violent alternatives that we
do not take the time to think about. In order to justify itself, our
military has to involve its self in warfare every once in a while. They
are going to jump right into without attempting to find a non-violent
alternative. Their jobs depend on it. If we question these things and
express our disaproval, then we will find that we are more often finding
non-violent alternatives where we would normally employ violence. This
would progressively lead to the attentuation and finally the
trancendance of violence. Our government truly does provoke violence. We
sold Suddham Hussein many of his weapons. Do you imagine that we did not
expect him to use them? Of course we did, and thus we had an excuse to
start a war. Our government supplies drugs to inner cities. This has
been reported in many newspapers lately. Our government fuels
unneccessary violence. Watching the media, it may seem as if violence is
necessary, but this is not the case. We can progressively overcome it,
and we will eventually, its just a matter of will we start now or later?

 
We would reduce a great deal of violence by:

1. Make drugs of all kinds legal.
2. Stop selling and/or giving arms to third world countries.
3. The United States should cease intervening in the affairs of other
   countries entirely. We are not the third world police.
4. Add emotive education in our public and private schools.
5. Take 3/4 of the unbelievable sum we spend on the military and use   
that for personalized criminal reform rather than sending people to
   prisons as they exist today. [ A kid gets busted, not particularly a
   bad kid yet, perhaps not too intelligent. The system sends him to
   jail where he lives day in and day out with criminals, ominous
   authority, and the torture of sodomy. That kid is going to change
   from someone who made a mistake into a demented criminal. Lets stop
   putting people in an environment which only magnifies their violent
   urges. We have plenty of money to deal with this issue. Just take it
   from the military.]

 
Then as individual's we can learn to discipline ourselves to first seek
alternatives to violence before resorting to violence. I have never been
in a physical fight in my life. How is that? Because I have never
threatened anyone, and when someone has shown me irrational signs of
violence emerging from them, I have hitherto always been able to help
them see reason, to bring them down.

Teensy Transistors Get Even Smaller
by Kristi Coale=20

3:01=A0pm=A0PST=A05=A0Feb=A097 - A new seven-nanometer square transistor=
 could help
chip makers cram more memory into the same silicon space they now use for
their microprocessors.=20

The Room Temperature Single Electron MOS Memory transistor, developed at
the University of Minnesota, uses a single electron to represent one bit of
information. Existing transistors on random access memory SIMMs and
semiconductors use a fluctuating level of electrons - roughly 30,000,
researchers said - to make up one binary bit of memory.=20

Microprocessor manufacturers that used the new technology would be able to
place trillions of transistors in the same space that, in the case of
today's Pentium, is occupied by 5.5 million transistors.=20

"This would increase the overall power of the chip without increasing the
fabrication costs and power consumption," said Stephen Chou, professor of
electrical engineering at the University of Minnnesota.=20

Apparently, the semiconductor industry has taken notice. Chou said the
major chip makers, including Texas Instruments and Intel, have contacted
him about evaluating the technology.

"Risk: You cannot discover new oceans unless you have the courage
 to lose sight of the shore."

It's called adapting in a co-evolutionary environment, survival of the
fittest.  Are you wishing away the physical laws of evolution?  Wow, I'm
impressed with what you can do once you've chucked truth out the window.

<Violence is perpetuated by an appreciation or desire for violence.>

You move through life, from conception to death, appropriating space and
time, energy and matter from the living entities in your environment.  You
are violently appropriating these all the time, whether or not you have the
capacity to appreciate or desire such violent appropriation.  This is the
truth.  If you jettison truth, I guess you can usefully delude yourself
that you have not been committing acts of violence all your life against
other living entities, whether you knew you were or not.  Your violent
appropriations from other humans may be from unintended consequences, from
indirect "externalities," from studied ignorance, but they are very real. 
You can try to define this aspect of life away, but you will not change the
reality of it.  What right do you have to exist at all, where did it come
from?

Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws.  One of the
best descriptions of evolution I have seen, is a famous passage by Joseph
de Maistre from his book "Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg":

  "In the whole vast dome of living nature there reigns an open violence, a
kind a prescriptive fury which arms all the creatures to their common doom:
 as soon as you leave the inanimate kingdom you find the decree of violent
death inscribed on the very frontiers of life.  Over all these numerous
races of animals man is placed, and his destructive hand spares nothing
that lives.  He kills to obtain food and he kills to clothe himself; he
kills to adorn himself; he kills in order to attack and he kills to defend
himself; he kills to instruct himself and he kills to amuse himself; he
kills to kill.  Proud and terrible king, he wants everything and nothing
resists him  his table is covered with corpses   And who [in the general
carnage] will exterminate him who exterminates all the others?  Himself. 
It is man who is charged with the slaughter of man   So is accomplished 
the great law of the violent destruction of living creatures.  The whole
earth, perpetually steeped in blood, is nothing but a vast altar upon which
all that is living must be sacrificed without end, without measure, without
pause, until the consummation of things, until evil is extinct, until the
death of death."

I suspect this view of evolution is uncomfortable for you.  It is far
easier to indulge in psycho-babble to divert attention from how things
really work.

RJ: <Gregory has whined utopically about how bad it is to develop violent
technology:>

Gregory: <The above sounds more like a personal and verbally *violent*
attack than it does a rational argument.>

If you view the truth to be committing violence, and you dislike violence,
no wonder you dislike truth.

<...that person may not be able to keep that resolution do to the force of
underlying, unquestioned, subconscious emotions.>

Modern neuroscience, particularly in the nineties, has pretty much done
away with the last disreputable vestiges of this Freudian propaganda.

<If we ignore [emotions] then they control us without our being aware of
it. Deny it and you remain naive and determined.>

Our emotions don't make us robots, they make us human.  Your distaste for
truth again shows itself by inverting reality.  Trust your emotions, give
yourself a break.  Just because people have claimed that eating Twinkies
caused them to commit heinous criminal acts doesn't mean they can escape
responsibility for their actions.

<This need to show others that we are stronger is caused by excess dopamine
in the central nervous system.  It is primitive.>

Sheesh, what do I know, huh?  Here I thought it was a fiendishly complex
adaptive evolutionary strategy to survive.  The world is so much simpler
when that pesky truth isn't hanging around being such a wet blanket.

<Look at our entertainment industry. It is fueled by our appreciation of
violence.>

It is fueled by dumping truth in favor of utility.  Violence has great
utility for the barbarians of today who have grown up spoon-fed a steady
diet of your brand of relativism.

<Well, perhaps you should check where some of your violent urges come
from.>

Physician, heal thyself.

<I believe the desire to do violence is a projection upon others one's
desire to have violence done to him/herself.>

Get a refund from your Psych 101 class.

<People have violent urges when they feel insecure.>

There are a lot of elderly individuals who feel insecure in their own
neighborhoods because of the roving barbaric thugs, steeped in relativism
and chock full of self-esteem, outside their doors.  Do the insecure
elderly in this situation have violent urges?  Is it these raging grannies
we need to slip an emotive education to?

<It comes from within when a person is unappreciative of themself, when
they feel inadequate, unable to consciously bare the feeling that they want
to die, they will often express this in violent thought, or the
appreciation of violence in entertainment, and when taken to the extreme
they will commit actual acts of violence.>

Are you getting this from "Psychology Today"?  Barney the Dinosaur?  The
Ricki Lake Show?

<From without it comes when one is threatened by the other, but if one
breaks down emotively and thus rationally and chooses to persist in playing
the violent game with the other, then that fear and paranoia will be
cultivated. If we did not always react to insecure feelings with immidiate
violent feelings, then we might just be able to use that same reactive
mental energy to focus on creating *progressive* non-violent alternatives.>

Do you mean like "Love your neighbor" and "Turn the other cheek"?  How
novel.

I don't think people would work non-stop, simply because (as you point 
out) they would become non-productive. My guess is that the work would 
become divided into a loose schedule broken up by other activities. It 
would certainly change the way we look at free time and work.

Exactly! I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people decided against 
removing sleep, which would limit the use of not sleeping for many of the 
sleepless (except for us solitary scientists and writers, of course). 

However, I doubt it will be easy to remove sleep. My current belief is
that it is used by the brain to encode the memories of the day from
hippocampal storage; this process cannot be easily speeded up without
wholesale neurological redesign, and without it we would not learn or
remember well (might be useful for some politicians, though). But maybe we
could use lucid dreaming techniques to remain aware and effective anyway? 
Just because we are physically immobile doesn't mean we have to remain in 
our heads...

Welcome!  FYI, the ExI-East list is meant to be used for discussions of 
local events, meetings, etc. of Extropians on the East Coast, so let's 
move this thread over to the main list (extropians@extropy.org).

I've been on a Sterling kick myself of late, too.  I finished "Holy Fire" 
a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it, and was happy to find a hardback 
copy of "Heavy Weather" at a Crown Books here in VA for $4.  Not as good, 
but still interesting.  After that I'll probably dig into "Schismatrix 
Plus."

I believe it does necessarily follow, and wages would necessarily decline.
The argument is a simple application of the same economic laws that have
caused working hours to decline.  As wages have risen (and I don't know
really why they have risen, so I won't set forth my theories), and people
have had more entertainment opportunities available, the marginal value of
an additional 1 hr of working has declined and the marginal value of an
additional 1 hr of leisure has risen.

If everyone suddenly had 8 additional leisure hours per day, this would
necessarily reduce the marginal value of leisure time.  It would also
increase the marginal value of work, since people would have more time to
spend money.  Necessarily, statistically speaking, people would work
more hours.  Lower wages follows from the increase in the worker-hour pool,
and because the minimum amount of money needed to support yourself and your
family for a week, which is the minimum amount that the large unskilled labor
pool will accept for a week's work, does not change (or even goes down,
due to not needing a house), while the number of hours they can work doubles.

I don't know if it is happening, but we might make it happen. We have 
some ideas here in Aleph to have a little genetics course for our 
members, and I think quite a few of them would like to do their own 
experiments... 

Still, take a look at Charles Stross' "Dechlorinating the moderator" at
http://www.antipope.demon.co.uk/charlie/fiction/moderator.html
for a (humorous) similar scenario in a different field :-)

neuroscience readings.

Hmm, the first sounds like a neurotrophic factor. I found no references 
to them in the medical parts of the WWW, but several in a roleplaying 
supplement on the net, suggesting that they might be fiction.

Of course, there are NGFs that act on the young brain, but I doubt they 
are that useful in adults.

Robin Hanson, in his Extropy article about uploads, has a brief footnote
that discusses some theory about how much people will work.  Here is
what he says, from
<URL: http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/uploads.html#footnote3 >:

   Consider a model where utility is roughly a product of powers of leisure
   and consumption, and amount produced is roughly a product of powers of
   labor and other capital. Such a model can explain why leisure time has
   not changed much as per capita wealth has increased dramatically over
   the last few centuries, can explain high leisure among slave owners,
   and explains why leisure is higher in places and times with high income
   taxes. One can explain seasonal high leisure among foraging tribes as
   due to seasonal limits on foraging productivity.

This is pretty compact, but the general idea is that if you can
significantly increase your income by working more hours, then you will
have an incentive to do so.  If you suddenly gave everyone 8 more hours
a day, a first order estimate is that it would be divided up roughly as
the rest of the day is, about 50-50.  To get a more precise estimate you
have to look at how each individual would value an hour of additional
leisure vs an hour of additional income.

The suggestion that wages would fall ignores one fact.  If people are
working more hours, more goods are being produced.  Wages are ultimately a
matter of productivity.  Unless productivity falls, wages should not fall.
I see no particular reason why the additional profits should flow to
the capitalist.

There will also be increased demand for many consumer goods since people
are awake and alert all day, so they will increase their consumption of
most things.  This should lead to a general increase in economic activity
in virtually all sectors.

Now at first it is possible that productivity would fall somewhat
during the transitional period.  There could be insufficient capital
equipment to match the increased labor pool.  But this should be quickly
remedied.  And don't forget that the same factors which cause increases
in productivity today would increase as well.  There will be more hours
for inventors, scientists, and other creative people to come up with new
and better methods of production.  So actually we would expect the rate
of productivity improvements to increase since there are more hours per
year for people to work on this.

Ultimately therefore I would expect wages to be higher, for people
to have both more money and more leisure, and for there to be more
goods produced.  Unless you count the loss of sleep as a negative in and
of itself, it looks to me like it would be a great boon to free ourselves
from the need to sleep.

No, I am not suggesting that. The emotion I feel when I use my ESP to probe 
your mind is absolutely real, no doubt about it. The question is, is it the 
same emotion that you experience? It's far from obvious that it is, after all, 
the exact same input can make you very happy and me very sad.


        >that you can't be sure that you are really feeling what he feels         


But how can I be sure? I don't have ESP but I often see people and think that 
if I were in their position I would be very  happy, but I'm not the one in 
that situation, and they are and to my surprise they tell me they're 
miserable.  

There is a problem when you say what would I be like if I were you, or what
would this be like if it were that, because then it wouldn't be "this"  
anymore. The problem is not too bad if the two things are similar, it makes  
some sense to ask "what would this apple be like if it were blue", it would  
make less sense to ask "what would this apple be like if it were a blue  
banana. 

Asking what somebody else's subjective experience would be like if it were  
yours, is like asking what would this post be like if it were a blue giraffe.


        >then this starts to sound like solipsism.  


This is a separate issue, but I could not function if I really thought that  
solipsism was true, so I take it as an axiom that  it is not. You claim that  
a proof that solipsism is not true can be found, I think any such proof would  
be flawed.        

        >You would be directly perceiving his mind


Even with ESP there would have to be a translating mechanism from your mind 
to mine, and something could get lost in the translation.

We both agree that a stop light and a tomato are the same color, but how can

        >if other people reading his mind perceive the same things I do,                  
        

I have no way of knowing if other people perceive the same thing that I do,  
the only thing I know about is the sound other people make with their mouth.

I agree, you certainly do have good grounds for believing that other  
conscious minds are real, I believe it too, we just don't have proof. I am 
far less certain that the subjective experience those other minds have is 
very similar to mine, but I'll never know for sure.

I don't care what it's like when John Clark pretends to be Hal Finney,

Again, I would say that if you are concerned with functionality you are
concerned with real functionality: you want the damn thing to work *in
reality*, do you not?  I don't understand what difference you see
between what you call 'functionality' and truth, facts.

It seems to me you are just looking for another *word* than 'truth',
perhaps because it has been used pompously in the past, like a stick to
beat people over the head with.  Nevertheless, I don't think you can get
away from the *concept*, which is a *functioning* concept.  You can't
escape the distinction between what *is* the case and what we *think* is
the case, as your talk about functionality above shows, and as your talk
below about signified and signifier also shows.

I can imagine science developing new techniques, but I can't imagine
anything different from science, which is just the quest for truth,
nothing more, nothing less.  Seeking the truth is a possible thing you
can do, and that possibility is forever open.

I don't understand what you mean by 'arbitrary': surely, if we ask
questions of the world, and we get a coherent response, then our
question has 'carved nature at the joints', at least to some extent? 
It's possible that an idea may be arbitrary in the sense that we woke up
one morning and just had it, but if, as soon as we apply it to the world,
the idea is coherent (gets coherent responses) then it's not arbitrary,
it *fits* the world.  Again, I would ask you, are you interested in real
functionality, or some other kind?

Actually, I've just realised where I think you are going wrong.  You
think that 'being' is a static term, and truth, since it is related to
being, as static also.  'Being' to me is an all-inclusive concept,
denoting what exists, which includes things, experiences, events,
functions, etc.

But that's precisely what I'm saying: they are not the same at all. 
That there is such a thing as an x1 wave at all is a conjecture; but it
is not an arbitrary conjecture because it coheres with the rest of our
thought and our experience, so what else ought we to think other than
that it probably does correspond in the absolute sense?  Until a *more*
coherent (more 'functional'  in your sense?) concept comes along, we are
perfectly entitled to think that it denotes something real, and that a
question involving its use has a true or false answer.

It seems to me that you are following the postmodernists into a blind
alley. Let me put it this way: if I put a stick in the ground, then
things have an objective distance from it.  My placing of the stick may
have been 'arbitrary' in some sense, but the distances are not.  The
trouble with postmodern thinkers is that having successfuly demolished
'presence' and 'intrisicism' they think they have demolished objectivity
and truth.  Not so: for truth never *did* depend on presence and
intrinsicism.  Those elements of presence and intrinsicism in Platonic/
Aristotelian thinking were in fact elements of subjectivity, granted (as
you say, confusion of signified and signifier).  

I think what happened was that philosophers wanted to keep their cake
and eat it: they wanted the functionality of the concept of objectivity/truth,
which distinguishes between what is and what we think is, but they also
wanted a sort of surreptitious, backdoor guarantee that after all, there
might be some sort of queer connection between what is and what we think
is such that, in some cases, what we think is *guaranteed* to be true.
But this quest contradicts the very idea of truth, the very point of the
concept of objectivity: so it's no surprise that this quest has been
completely and utterly seen for what it is this century.

But this victory is *not* a victory over the concept of truth, but a
victory over a misunderstanding of it.

Reilly, this view of the world is not wholly true, but only partially
true.  Co-operation is also a strong theme in nature.  Or did you miss
that part of Biology 101 because it didn't suit you?

>Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws. 

Try actually reading what people are saying instead of jumping to
conclusions.  You are reading Gregory through some sort of half-assed
Objectivist, pseudo-realist filter.  What the hell is wrong with
utopianism, so long as it isn't trying to capture the force of law?
Aren't we allowed to try and make things better in your view of the world?
 Given your 'realistic' view of things, what would *you* suggest we do
 to lessen violence in society?

You fail to distinguish between how things really work and how *you*
think they really work.  You are betraying the very concept of truth you
suppose you uphold.  Yes, there is a lot of violence in nature; but co-
operation is also a possibility.  Nature wasn't made to satisfy Gregory's
whims, for sure: neither was it made to satisfy yours.

Ehh?  Pardon me?  How *could* neuroscience do that anyway?  Certainly
nobody believes Freud's whole story anymore, but no psychologist would
deny the concept of the subconscious in *some* functional sense.  What
about MacLean's 'Triune Brain' theory?

Gregory hasn't said anything anywhere about lack of emotional control excusing

Come off it, this is not what he's talking about at all.  Barbaric thugs
chock full of self-esteem?  Precisely the opposite is true, in *most*
cases. Go back and read your Rand again and try and learn something from
her instead of just picking up her prejudices.

Does something have to be novel to be true?  The fact of the matter, as
I see it, is that you are quite correct to say that we should always
have in reserve the most powerful weapons we can make.  But Gregory is
correct in what he is saying about emotional training, and that it's a
far better strategy when you are dealing with intelligent creatures to
take on the responsibility of cutting of the negative feedback
retaliation loop than to just dumbly let it keep going, eating up
resources.  Speak softly and carry a big stick, no?

Nope. We are going to use science to remove evolution's constraints on
us. How? When we finally create the enabling technology necessary to be
"immortal", we will no longer be participating in evolution. We will no
longer have to reproduce in order to perpetuate the race. We will make a
shift from species evolution to individual development. 

Evolution has got us where we are today. For that I am appreciative. But
it will one day be obsolete to me when I have developed beyond its
primitive ways. Evolution does not have the necessary self-consciousness
to see beyond violence. I do.

If I attain immortality via science, I doubt I will forever remain in
this universe. It may take thousands or even millions of years, perhaps
only a couple centuries, but I am optimistic that one day as a highly
*developed* entity I will learn to create my own universes, my own
realities. I am just as optimistic that I will have by then developed
something better, more *useful* than evolution.

Does evolution itself not evolve? No you say. You say its laws are
absolute and I must not question its laws of violence. Here is yet
another ontotheological sublimation. 

Heres an analogy of how we progress in moral matters. We once allowed
and even advocated slavery, even George Washington had slaves. Good
businessmen had slaves, but we overcame that. Our modern enslavement is
employment. The general masses are given minimum wage, hardly enough to
survive, so that they must work endless hours, thus giving them no time
to question the system, but some day, perhaps very soon, sciences such
as nanotechnology will allow us to overcome this modern form of slavery.
When we can make anything we need on demand from self-replicating
devices, we will no longer have a need for money, the single most
corrupting concept in our modern times.

Just as we can overcome slavery by degree, we can overcome violence by
degree. Your difficulty in understanding this may lie in a black and
white perceptiong of violence vs non-violence. There are degrees between
them. All that is required to begin moving towards non-violence is to
take steps by degree.

Yes I do, but by degree I do so in a much less violent manner than many
of my ancestors, and I certainly, by degree, do so in a much less
violent manner than many of my contemporaries. I am developing towards
non-violence. Eventually we will learn to tap into the energy in empty
space. We will no longer be required to take it from the other.
Eventually we will be able to create our own space, no longer having to
take it from the other. We are begining to enable the technology now to
make this possible.

I never said I had not taken part in violent activity. All competitive
activity is violent. I said I had never been in a physical fight. It is
your authoritarian truth sublimated in evolution that does not allow you
to see beyond violence.

The reality of? The absolute and unquestionable, unchangeable truth of
it? I am not going to define that aspect of life away, I am going to
determine it as unuseful and thus in *action* create and alternative.

Why are you ceaselessly attempting to bring authoritarean concepts into
these matters? Your argument has been based on evolution up to this
point, and now you bring the concept of "rights" into the picture,
something that does not exist in evolution. Evolution sees no rights.
Via natural selection it removes the least fit. The least fit are given
no rights by evolution.  

 
> Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws.

By *utopian* you mean nice but *impossible* to achieve. A round earth
was imagined impossible by those who lacked the capacity to imagine
otherwise. Space travel was thought to be impossible by those who lacked
the capacity to imagine otherwise. The atomic bomb was thought to be
impossible by those who lacked the capacity to imagine otherwise. Just
because you lack the capacity to imagine a non-violent world does not
mean that it cannot or will not be achieved. Science eventually
penetrates such obstenance.

How could that be one of the best descriptions of evolution when it
focuses primarily on killing. What about the natural selection part. You
are focusing on one out of many parts of evolution. I will grant you
that the part on killing is a suitable definition. This is why science
will eventually overcome evolution.


> I suspect this view of evolution is uncomfortable for you.

No. I do not find words or groups of words uncomfortable. Once again, I
am not trying to redefine evolution. It is what it is. I am merely
attempting to illustrate how such will be transcended by future science.
You can choose to take part in this now, to wait til later until more
people have, or to wholly deny it forever ... but in either case, it
will occur. I am dynamically optimistic of this.

I see how things work now just fine. I think the psycho-babble as you
call it is being used to inhibit a progressive view on what is possible
in the future. You are clinging to how things are *now*, and are thus
unopen to change.

What? Stop confusing truth as an entity. It is not a person, a god, or a
thing. It is a concept. Truth cannot commit an act of violence. Truth
cannot commit an act of any sort. This is one of the fundamental
problems. You mistake what I am saying as something entirely different
from what it is. At first I thought the problem was in your method of
decontextualization. But now I am uncertain that you are aware of it at
all.

Has it? Please elaborate for the sake of argument. I do not believe this
to be the case.

To the extent that our emotions determine they do make us robots or
automaton. And I am not going to fall into a trap of limiting what it is
to be human, but transhumans will certainly have taken much more control
over their emotions than contemporary humans. They will be able to lose
their emotive control less often while being able to become impassioned
and ecstatic more often.

I will not trust my emotions, I will not have *blind faith* in my
emotions. Your advice is particularly non-extropian.

The law holds these people responsible, but the people do not. You are
showing me an inability to take responsibility for your violent desires.
You say it is the fault of evolution, and that evolution cannot be
questioned. Thus you claim that evolution is at fault or is responsible
for violent desires. Fine, perpetuate it as long as you can, but it will
not last.

Nope, I was illustrating the particular cause. There are many levels of
cause determining every event. We could never mention them all. Not
everyone has the same level of dopamine running through their system.
People with less dopamine and more seratonin tend to think more
rationally on these issues, they tend to be less violent, because they
do not have as a great an urge to prove that they have bigger balls.

This is contrary to the rest of your argument. Your theory is the one
which embraces violence. Mine is the one that does not, thus your theory
is the one which promotes and supports the appreciation of violence in
entertainment, and mine does not.

Nope, in general they no longer have the dopamine levels necessary. Some
do, but most do not.

Nope, they are moving towards death themselves. Their phenotype is no
longer required by evolution to prove that they have bigger balls.

No, I do not watch much television. I believe it was you who was quoting

of a lot more interesting than anything they can show on some sitcom. I
find sitcoms and television in general to be of little value to me. So
please do not infer that your because you value television, our modern
opiate of the masses, that I do also. I have chosen to take a degree of
responsibity for the quality of information I consume.

Nope. You do not have to love someone in order not to be violent against
them. And no I am not saying turn the other cheek. I am saying to first
seek a non-violent alternative instead of immiediately responding to a
situation violently. In this way we will move towards non-violence by
degree. It is your over simplification of the complexity of my thought
that is not allowing you to see its validity. This is not to say that it
is very complex, just more so than you are willing to deal with.

I would only like to add to the anti-cryptography sentiment here that
the financial systems of the world today rely largely on trust, rather
than force or secrecy.  I think this is a bit dangerous (totalitarian
governments may be able to track the financing of a revoloution) but it
makes poeple rely on and trust each other in order to live, which is
probably good for us.

It is a well known saw that when goods and money cross boarders, armies
are much less likely to;  we probably gain peace on many interpersonal
levels from the necessity of trust, just as we gain peace
internationally through contracts and trade.

Thanks for responding passionately to something which was a private post

IMHO the Promethius Project is well intentioned and I doubt it will get

Huh??? Surely what you wrote isn't what you meant to say here. I know of
no
training or proof of ESP or telepathy. Or is this really "If there is
ESP, then you can learn to do it"??

As for qualia, we run into how compatible intercortical interfaces will
be.
In order of less and less compatability:

	Myself and a very recent upload of myself
	Myself and an old upload a few years ago
	Myself and an identical twin
	Me and you, a speaker of English
	Me and you, who only speaks Chinese
	...
	Myself and a dolphin

You get the idea. Similar problems already exist, ie UNIX vs Windows,
PC vs Mac...

There's certainly a difference between executing unknown code for
unknown
uses and stuff you know about and like. I doubt there will be much of a
market for running CAs, but there's lots of boring stuff like genetic
algorithms applied to the stock market, etc, which eat lots of CPU
cycles.
Now do I get to use the results of that when I rent my machine to you??
Probably not. I can also think of somthing which appears harmless like
"factor this big number" which isn't. Looks like a good theme for a SF
short story here....

Me too, but I suspect that a lot of this is just due to lack of processing
power. From the nature of evolution we're probably only just powerful
enough to be conscious and when we have to use a lot of processing power
to deal with external events we can't sustain our 'consciousness' program
as well. Or in maths, something like: 

	Thought + Emotion + Perception = Constant

Or writing software, in the famous (at least around here) "coding trance". 

I was reading John Lilly's autobiography ("Center of the Cyclone") on the
bus from Seattle to Chicago a few months ago and he talks about this at
the end in his theory of conscious states. His basic neutral state is the
normal ego you're talking about here, and then above that is the "coding
trance" where you stop thinking and just act.

Well, Freudians do, but personally I tend to feel that ego, or at least
the internal monologue which goes along with it, is a bad habit and vastly
overrated.

}         What kind of democracy would you fight: the ideological form or the
} current American political form...they are vastly different.

I thought I'd take this opportunity to throw out one of my wacky ideas
again.

Since it seems likely that we need _some_ government, to regulate
necessary non-local interactions (pollution, other public bane/public
good problems) and to make necessary but arbitrary decisions (which side
of the road to drive on), we still need to think about what form of
gov't to have, and representative legislatures still seem the best bet.
It's more convenient to have a small group decide things than a large
one, and the subset of people can devote more time to studying the
issues than the whole population would.

But our current system doesn't satisfy that very well.  PC or not PC, I
don't think that it can be argued that a bunch of mostly white male rich
lawyer-politicians is an accurate cross-section of the nation.  This
could be justified in 18th century thought on the grounds that those
people might be better qualified to make decisions than the populace --
implying that the people can judge qualifications to judge better than
they can judge in general, but never mind that.

However, I doubt most people (let alone the ones on this list) have that
much respect for their extant legislators.  More theoretically, it is
not clear why they should have superior powers of mind; most obviously
they are selected for the ability to get elected.  One would hope that
their electorate was judging them by the ability to make good decisions,
but in fact considerations of pork obtained, seniority, and sheer amount
of advertising seem to be the main factors.  And they don't even have
that much time to devote to studying, as raising money is a large
concern.

So if our current system seems to lack any of the virtues it should
have, what could replace it?  The simplest way to get a representative
cross-section of the population is to select a few hundred to a thousand
people at random.  This would rarely be an exact representation, but it
should be much closer and more reliable than our current legislatures.
They would not, of course, be any more qualified than the whole
population, but since we are supposedly a democratic nation this doesn't
seem to be a philosophical problem, and I've alread assumed that no one
believes the winners of elections are all that qualified either.  And,
as the representatives have no election to worry about, they have no
need to spend time raising money, and less need to be beholden to
lobbies; "big money" would have much less influence.  Admittedly without
re-election the only constraints on them to do a good job are their own
consciences and whatever media attention each gets, but I'm willing to
risk the trade-off.

This also provides a better justification than habit from the House of
Lords and the Senate for having an upper house; one term's crop of the
lower house, or a random subset thereof, can be retained for the next
term's upper house, to provide some experience and continuity and a
brake on silly legislation.  WIth 500+ legislators the change of a
skewed house is small; getting a bad skew two terms in a row,
particularly the _same_ skew, is even more unlikely.

This can be fine-tuned of course, but the basic idea is that the current
unrepresentative legislatures, selected for campaigning ability and
access to money, should be replaced with large pools of randomly
selected people, which should be no less qualified, cheaper, and
possibly less corrupt.

(Key sidepoint: lots of media attention on the selection process
itself.)

Like the ancient greeks did in Athens ?

A few suggestions:

Being able to 'rule'

For such a (minimal) state to function, one needs a minimal (state)
educational system, teaching basic law, next to the most basic skills
needed to function in society. So everybody knows how to 'rule' instead of
just knowing how to be 'ruled'. I suggest a (one day a week or so)
educational system that runs alongside to the various private education
systems.  

corruption

In a smaller state the possibilities for corruption will already be far
less, as well as the 'campaign contributions' you pointed out will be
eleiminated. But still to ensure a corrupt free political system, maybe
supervisors could be randomly assigned to check the representatives,
swicthing between them on a regular basis.  

funding

Why not fund the political system on a capitalist basis ?. That is;
offering them a percentage of the benefits to society they bring, instead
of having the taxpayer pay their year income. The 'state' as a whole could
be rewarded by society a percentage of the increase of the economy,
basically paying them if they do well, and not paying them if they fail.
Political representative could become a lucrative (and popular!) job this
way... Ofcourse in an economically bad situation, many will refuse their
political right, and logically in such situations, their jobs will be
filled by relatively more people, who don't have to worry about losing a
years income, (by the process of random 'election' and refusal), & economy
could restore itself that way, as these people would have (generally
speaking) a better economical insight. (to whatever extent that would still
be needed in a minimized state...) 

I'm all for it, as there's one other thing you forgot in your criticism of
democracy not being a correct representation of society: Know any
congressmen of 18 or 21 years old ?

Like the ancient greeks did in Athens ?

A few suggestions:

Being able to 'rule'

For such a (minimal) state to function, one needs a minimal (state)
educational system, teaching basic law, next to the most basic skills
needed to function in society. So everybody knows how to 'rule' instead of
just knowing how to be 'ruled'. I suggest a (one day a week or so)
educational system that runs alongside to the various private education
systems.  

corruption

In a smaller state the possibilities for corruption will already be far
less, as well as the 'campaign contributions' you pointed out will be
eleiminated. But still to ensure a corrupt free political system, maybe
supervisors could be randomly assigned to check the representatives,
swicthing between them on a regular basis.  

funding

Why not fund the political system on a capitalist basis ?. That is;
offering them a percentage of the benefits to society they bring, instead
of having the taxpayer pay their year income. The 'state' as a whole could
be rewarded by society a percentage of the increase of the economy,
basically paying them if they do well, and not paying them if they fail.
Political representative could become a lucrative (and popular!) job this
way... Ofcourse in an economically bad situation, many will refuse their
political right, and logically in such situations, their jobs will be
filled by relatively more people, who don't have to worry about losing a
years income, (by the process of random 'election' and refusal), & economy
could restore itself that way, as these people would have (generally
speaking) a better economical insight. (to whatever extent that would still
be needed in a minimized state...) 

I'm all for it, as there's one other thing you forgot in your criticism of
democracy not being a correct representation of society: Know any
congressmen of 18 or 21 years old ?

There is more and less functional. Something that pretends to be

functional is, by degree, more or less functional in pretending to be

functional, but not functional beyond pretending to be functional.

Something that pretends to be functional is functional, just not in the

way it pretends, e.g, we often make models of things which are not

functional, but they pretend to be. A model space shuttle has

functionality as pretending to be a functional space shuttle.

You can call functionality real functionality and then true
functionality if you want to, but there is no need to make this
isomorphism. 



I am invoking Occam's razor here. There is no reason to use the term

truth when speaking of functionality. It is an extraneous and

unnecessary term. Something is either more or less functional in its

intended purpose. There is no reason for me to say it is truely

functional or falsely functional. The word is not needed.





> I don't understand what difference you see

> between what you call 'functionality' and truth, facts.



Thus showing that the term truth is not necessary, I will now list why

it is less functional than either the term useful or the term

functional. The following are my reasons for proposing this shift in

terminology. The following details the differences between functionality

and truth. [This is pretty lengthy, a great deal of recapitulation, but
most of it has been informed and refined by our unfolding discussion.
There is of course, as there will always be, room for further
refinement.]



1. The words useful or functional have a more direct association to our

emotive needs and desires and thus to motivation, volition, and

intention. Science is motivated by desire, even the [unnecassary] desire

for truth is a desire. The term truth inhibits this realization. It is

too abstracted. It is not as functional to believe that we are motivated

by truth as it is to believe that we are motivated by functionality.

When we realize that we are motivated by functionality, by our own needs

and desires, then we are more likely to question those motivations. But

if we believe we are motivate by the almighty truth, then there is

nothing to question. We do not question our motivations.



2. If we do not feel the need to question our motivations then we are

bound to remain determined.



3. If we do not feel the need to question our motivations then we will

not delve into the subconscious in order to make conscious those

underlying forces which are determining our motivation. 



4. The term truth has an epistemological bias. It is biased to a

particular modality of consciousness. It does not promote modalities of

consciousness which will allow an individual to attain more emotive

control, and thus more rational control. It does not promote the

exploration of endogenous reality. Our emotions effect our centreal

nervous system (CNS) and vice versa. If we learn to control our emotions

as connoisseurs of consciousness, then we can sustain modes of

consciousness such as rationality and ecstasty for extended periods of

time. Just as conflicting emotions often combine to create new emotions,

perhaps we will discover new modes of rationality when such modes

dynamically clash in the same moment with some form of ecstasy.   



5. The term truth has an objective bias. Thus we compound its inhibition

of the exploration and understanding of endogenous reality.



6. The term truth implies the absolute. If I call a theory true it is

less likely to be questioned than if I call that theory functional. It

is much easier to imagine something more functional, than to imagine

something more true.



7. The term truth requires that when we say one thing we mean something

*slightly* different, e.g., "when we call something true that means we

*conjecture* it to be true." When we think of things as more as less

functional we do not run into this problem. When we say something is

functional, we mean it is functional. We are saying exactly what we

mean. There is no room for confusion here. The use of the term truth

confuses the signified with the signifier. Another case of this is when

we say that it is true that x is y, when x is the particular and y is a

constant symbolic ideal. It would be less confusing to say that x

functions as a y.



8. Truth is an authoritarian concept whereas functionality is not.

Functionality is thus better suited to a system such as pancritical

rationalization.



9. A theory is only true in relation to reality, but a theory is

functional in relation to reality *and* in relation to other theories.

This also makes functionality better suited to PCR. A functional theory

is still open to question where as a true theory is not so. It is much

more difficult to criticize something we have given the exalted status

of true than it is to question something we have merely shown to have a

degree of functionality.



10. Truth is an ontotheological sublimation of God. It is a platonic

primitive. An *ideal* absolute. It is a static unchangeable concept, and

is thus not appropriate to science. Usefulness or functionality are not

even nouns, as adjectives they are much less static. As God could not be

questioned, neither can truth. Science has no place for unquestionable

things.



11. Many people believe that the terms of a theory are actual entities

when in many cases this is not true. They think this is so because of

the epistemological fixation truth requires. The forces that Newton

described in his theory do not necessarily exist, but they were useful

to make predictions. Einstein was able to explain the very same

phenomena as Newton, and more, with pure geometry. Einstein did not have

to invoke Newton's forces. When we talk about functionality it is much

easier to imagine the terms of a theory as arbitrary tools that do not

necessarily *truely* exist. It does not matter if they exist or not as

long as the theory is useful for prediction. 



12. Reality is not static and unchanging. So how could there be a static

and unchanging truth that accords to it? There cannot be. The term

functionality does not intrinsically say that things are static or

unchanging. It is thus more useful, less confusing.



13. The sum total of all the inconsistencies in the use and meaning of

truth makes it a sort of mystification. It defers the actual meaning of

itself. The term function does no such thing.



14. Since function does not have a bias towards a single modality of

conscioussnes, it allows us to employ a greater portion of consciousness

in attempting to create artificial consciousness. Since truth has a bias

towards cognitive modalities of consciousness, it is unlikely that

employing it we will ever attain something which functions very well as

an artificial intelligence. That thing would lack intuition, a very

necessary modality of consciousness for intelligence.



15. There is no reason why we must revert to using the concept of truth

to say something is either true functionality, or false functionality.

There are degrees of functionality. Something is not either functional

or not functional, for some things are more functional than others. Here

we employ occam's razor. Truth is an extra unnecessary term.



16. A focus on truth leads to purely cognitive education, whereas a

focus on functionality leads to cognitive, intuitive, and emotive

education. Thus the latter engenders inidividuals who have the emotive

control to rationalize more rigorously than the former.



17. A focus on truth hinders genius due again to the fact that it leads

to a purely cognitive education. Genius requires emotive control, and an

extremely refined intuitive capacity.   



18. A person focused on truth is incapable of being as honest as a

person focused on usefulness and functionality. The person focused on

truth will be determined by unchecked underlying motivations,

motivations that they are unaware of and have made no sustained attempt

to become aware of. This is because truth's epistemological bias

attempts to limit consciousness to the cognitive modalities of

consciousness where functionality begins with emotion and moves up

through the modalities of consciousness until it reaches its final check

point in a cognitive modality. The person focused on function is then

going to have made a greater attempt of making unconscious motivations

conscious so that person can take responsibility for those motivations

and alter those motivations as needed via rationalization.



19. A person focused on function will be better apt at directing science

because that person has become more free by degree and thus less

determined than the person focused on truth.



20. We can create things in the name of truth, but we cannot create

things in the name of functionality. Truth can be used to justify

destructive creations, whereas functinality requires that the creation

itself be justified. Truth displaces and defers the purpose of creating

something, whereas it is obvious with functionality that the purpose of

creating something is its practical functionality, what it does and how

well it does it.



21. In general, shifting from truth to functionality broadens, empowers,

and impassions science. It makes science more robust, more autonomous

and capable of sustaining itself. Truth, epistemology, and knowledge are

limited to things we can cognitively think. Functionality deals with a

much broader spectrum of consciousness which includes emotions.



22. A shift from truth to functionality will may just be what of the

things which will enable singularity.



23. Science is intrinsically an emotive tool. It is a tool for

predicting things so that we can better attain that which we need or

desire. The terminology of science should thus reflect this. The term

truth denies this.  



24. The concept of truth buffers people from their emotions. It makes it

so they do not have to deal with them in a highly disciplined fashion.

Truth is perpetuated by people who are either too lazy to deal with

their emotions and subconsious. Truth is perpetuated by people who are

repulsed by themselves and who thus have no desire to delve into their

emotions and subconscious. Truth is perpetuated by people who fear

themselves and their subconsious and who are thus unwilling to delve

into their emotions and subconscious.  



25. It is more important for a person to be useful to society than for a

person to be true to society. A person can question and criticize

society while proposing useful reforms, thus being useful to it while

not being true to it. The same can be said in relation to science.



26. Because truth is thought to be the current goal of science, many

people believe then that there can be anything greater, beyond, or

transcendental of science. This is extremely misleading. Truth was the

goal of religion, and then we developed philosophy. Truth was the goal

of philosophy and then we developed science. Truth is the goal of

science and someday we will probably develop something more useful than

science. Except this time, truth will not be the goal any longer. We are

going to make a shift similar as that between Newton's theory and

Einstein's theory. We are going to adopt new terms in order to predict

more phenomena more usefully.



27. "The definition of truth stipulates an *ideal* scenario.  It defines

what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get there." The definition of

functionality does help us to get where we want to go because it is

grounded in practicality and not in idealism.



28. With a goal of usefulness, general discourse will become more useful

rather than merely true. I could tell you true trivial things all day

which are "true" and never attain any depth, but if we are more

concerned with the communication of useful information we will progress

to greater depths. 



29. Without emotion or functionality science could not even exist. No

one would feel the emotion of need or the emotion of desire in order to

create science. Science can exist without truth though. It can exist in

a subjective world without absolute absolutes just as long as things

remain nearly the same long enough for us to treat them as objective and

thus to enable us to predict things. We can functionally entertain the

idea of absolute things without them *truely* being absolute. Suppose

what we think of as constants are merely shifting in degree at an

infintessimal level beyond our ability to measure. Its possible. But in

the end it does not matter as long as we can functionally consider them

absolutes. Thus truth is not necessary to science whereas function is. 



30. Where truth, an authoritarean concept, hinders the dissolving of

government, a focus on functionality helps prepare us for the dissolving

of government. "It might not be the best word to use, anarchy, but I

believe that it is in a sense where Libertarianism is leading us ...

just in a sense perhaps, but in any fashion, Libertarianism requires

that we take responsibility from the governement and claim those

responsibilities for ourselves. In a psuedo-anarchic system we will need

to have learned a great deal more about our emotions and how to

effectively employ them before we can imagine such a system to remain

orderly."



31. A focus on truth promotes external regulation, whereas a focus on

functionality promotes individual responsibility. This is because truth

is by defintion absolute and authoritarian where as functionality is

grounded in the emotions, need and desire, and thus in motivation,

intention, and volition. This makes function more useful than truth both

in libertarianism and pancritical rationalization.



32. Again, a focus on functionality leads to a desire for greater

emotive control. Another example of where it would be beneficial

[useful] for scientists to gain greater control over their emotions is

when the government and other instituitions cut funding to them. Instead

of "squealing" they might speak with emotive passion and charisma.

Instead of waisting hours, perhaps days and weeks, being pissed off,

they might be using that time *usefully* working on an appeal or seeking

funding elsewhere. Also, it is better to argue that your research should

be funded because of its function rather than your research should be

funded because it is seeking truth. The government does not want your

*ideal* truth. It wants something that functions [particularly something

that functions destructively].



33. Though the person focused on truth can rationalize violence as

irrational, that person is more likely to be violent and to participate

in the creation of violent technology because that person does not have

the same control over his/her emotions as the person focused on

usefulness. A kleptomaniac might come to the realization that what he is

doing is *wrong* and that he would like to stop, but in that same

instance he steals something because he has not delved into his

subconscious in order to truly take responsibility for his emotive

drives. He may have the cognitive and rational skill to realize his

problem, but not the emotive capacity to truly deal with it. 



34. Based on the same argument in 33, a person who holds truth as a

higher priority than usefulness is more likely to be a Charlaten,

saying/thinking/rationalizaing one thing while feeling and doing yet

another. Severing emotion from cognition severs the individual.



35. When people seek truth they seek answers from the other. Thus those

seeking truth are much more likely to conform to the beliefs of others.

A person who seeks functionality is not going to be concerned with the

supposed truth of others. The person who seeks functionality is going to

question everything and determine for themself what is most functional. 



36. The concept of functionality is more consistent with the concept of

a theory than truth is. A theory lasts until a more functional theory

comes along, not until a more true theory comes along. Theories serve a

function, a need or desire. They do not serve a truth. Theories predict

functioning phenomena and events, they do not predict truth.



37. With functionality we can get rid of refuting. Instead of attempting

to *prove* something right or wrong, we criticize the usefulness of

something and attempt to create something more useful. Criticism is not

useful without an alternative. Refuting does not require an alternative

where as functionality does. Occam's razor compounds the reason to make

this shift. [Note: the criterion for criticism is not truth yet rather

usefulness.]





This list continues to grow and refine. The distinctions are subtle, but

the shift will have monumental effect.

The *actual* distance is not arbitrary, but the name we give it is. The

concept of inches is an arbitrary convention. The concept of meters is

an arbitrary convention. The are ways we have chosen to break larger

things up into smaller things. The way in which we differentiate the

organs or systems in a body is an arbitrary convention. We say we have

the circulatory system, the digestive system, etcetera. These are

arbitrary distinctions. They are not as distinct as the naming implies.

Either system could just as usefully be said to be part of the other

because neither would work without the other. Or we might choose to

define smaller arbitrary systems. This helps us understand complex

systems and events better.

There is an article on nanotechnology in the Feb/Mar 1997 issue of MIT 
Technology Review.  This article can provide a good introduction for those 
who are new to nanotechnology, and provides several links to related 
materials.

"Scientists are devising techniques that promise to transform 
nanotechnology--the ability to build tiny, complex structures molecule by 
molecule--from the theoretical into the practical. The hoped-for tool chest 
must include the equivalent of arms and hands that can assemble the 
structures on a microscopic scale, for example. Growing understanding of 
how to devise such tools should lead to products that are lighter, 
stronger, smarter, cheaper, cleaner, and more precise than anything we can 
build today."

Whew!  That was a big 'un.  I won't go through your arguments, some of
which make valid points, some of which are beside the point,as far as I
am concerned.  It still seems to me that your concept of functionality
is parasitic on the concept of truth.

In general, as I have said, I agree with pretty much everything you say
about emotional intelligence, but I think you are way off the mark in
thinking that a focus on truth hinders emotional intelligence: if you
want to 'delve into your subconscious', that *is* a focus on truth.

The units of measurement may be arbitrary, but the measurements
that we are interested in are not, and that is the whole point.  (However,
the division of the body into organs is *not* arbitrary: what is
arbitrary in that case is our interest in homeostasis,etc., but once our
interest is in place, the organs fall into perspective as objective
facts.)

I don't think it would be very useful to carry on much beyond this point,
as we just seem to be repeating ourselves!

But, interestingly, we've found solutions to those problems. You can run
Windows on Unix (WABI, WINE, SoftWindows) or Macs (SoftWindows), and run
Mac programs on PCs (I forget the name of the software to do it). None of
these solutions are as fast or compatible as running them native, but we
can do it. 

The biggest problem with extrapolating this to human programming is that
the human who would be trying to run the other human's software will have
roughly equal processing power, whereas typically the emulators are
running on computers with at least twice the power of the computer they're
emulating.

You put me in the very unusual position of defending the government of the

of any major weapon system that was made in America.

You will have to look long and hard to find somebody who has more contempt 
for "our" government or any government than me, but that accusation is made 
in many of the same newspapers that report on alien UFO abductions and crying 
statues, and is just about as reliable. Government commits enough real life

Agreed. We should also be able to buy any medicine without a prescription.


        >2. Stop selling and/or giving arms to third world countries.


Don't give them away certainly, but if somebody has the money it will be very 
difficult to stop them from getting any weapon they want. I worry a lot about 
the tens of thousands of H-bombs in the former USSR and the fact that the 
people in charge of their security make the equivalent of 50$ a month.

That would be a good start, after that if we could get the government to quit 
intervening in domestic affairs too then things would be great.   


        >4. Add emotive education in our public and private schools.


Just get rid of public schools and let private schools do as they please.

I have a better idea, give the money back to the people the government stole  
it from and let the individual decide how best to spend it.


        >Lets stop putting people in an environment which only magnifies

It would be different if we knew how to engineer a personality, then we could 
get rid of the violent urges in even the worst criminal, but we don't and 
there is no point in pretending that we do. No matter how much money you 
throw at the problem, prison will always be a dreadful environment because 
we're putting bad people where they don't want to be. We concentrate the most
horrible monsters we can find on this planet into one tiny area, make sure 
they can't leave and then expect them to reform. That is not realistic.

Prisons are only good for two things, to warehouse criminals so they can't 
commit violent crimes in the outside world, and as a deterrent. Time works in 
our favor, for reasons not well understood people tend to become less violent 
when they get older.

Let me say it another way. I can't run Microsoft Office under UNIX. I
can't
do a grep under Windows. A dolphin can't smell a rose.

If I emulate your qualia, do I experience your your experience, or
merely
experience operating the eumulation? Consider the difference between
running
a program such as a game or word processor at a functional level, and
running
the debugger in single step mode. The two experiences are vastly
different.

That reminds me of a great paranoid joke I heard recently:

Anybody got any more?

I believe this is John K Clark's argument also. It is only so if we
insist on reverting to the concept of truth in order to explain the
functional system.

Agreed. Will nip it in the bud and at least for now, agree to disagree.

I think it is important to remember that evolution works even in
individuals, in the selection of their memes. In an immortal,
self-transforming population there will still be an evolution, but instead
of dying you just accept that body- or mind-type X is better than your old
and change to it, no longer improving on your old design. It will in some 
sense be a Lamarkian form of evolution, consciously guided by 
individuals. A kind of meta-evolution, where there is replication and 
selection for forms of evolution.

Well, I would be interested in seeing what it was. I look forward to
future work in this area myself. Unfortunately I think evolution
(replication+variation+selection) is a very general and robust way to grow
complexity, although there are other ways too.

> I have 4 questions for you:

Most people imagine the following as self-evident: "I exist". We imagine
it will be true until we die. But to me its not a true or false
statement but one of degree. To say I we must refer to the ego, that
which is sayin "I", but my ego comes and goes. When fully focused on an
activity, I do not exist to the degree as when I am focused on me. When
sleeping yet not dreaming, I exist to very very little degree, my ego is
not existing at all. There is no one to say, "I exist". My ego, that
which says "I", is created on the fly. It comes and goes, and eventually
[if I do not attain immortality] it will go forever. 

The statement, "I think therefor I am", is more useful than the
statement, "I am". Where "I am" or "I exist" are absolute statements, "I
think therefor I am" is conditional. It functions as saying "If I think,
then I am".

When we have developed over time so that we can deal with more variables
in any given moment, I believe we will begin to make a shift from
absolute statements to more conditional statements. I believe our
language and thus our perception will in turn reflect this. As we
develop we will have the capacity to deal with a greater level of
relativity. Einstein came up with a theory of relativity. This theory is
still very difficult, even in simplistic terms, for the general populace
to understand. This is due to our current perception of the world,
structured by our language, our language being saturated in concepts of
absolutes, because we do not have the current capacity of consciousness
to deal with enough variables at any one time. Not only are we limited
to the number of variables that we can deal with in any given moment,
but we are limited to the number of perspectives we can entertain in any
given moment. Rarely do we try to compare two perspectives
simultaneously, and it might be considered *currently* impossible for us
to entertain three or more. We definitely cannot entertain ten
perspectives simultaneously.  

Our language is inundated with words and phrases which have or imply
absolute meaning, condition, or equality. These words and phrases have
gotten us this far, but in order to rise another level, in order to get
a more useful sense of reality, one which accords more closely to
reality, we are going to have to further develop our language. This
includes the language of mathematics. 

I believe this shift will begin to further attentuate all authoritarian
concepts and instituitions until such are no longer found useful to any
degree. There will certainly be a myriad of other contributing factors,
but many of these other factors will also be enabled by the same
increased ability to entertain more variables and more perspectives
simultaneously.

Until we have developed more in this fashion, I do not believe that my
theory of functionality over truth can be applied in every instance. But
seeing the value in it, we can begin by attentuating our use of absolute
terminology and enhancing our use of conditional terminology. We might
imagine this as a mental workout, attempting to deal with more
variables. 

Part of our problem with dealing with a great number of variables in any
given moment is our capacity for memory. In attempting and then failing
to employ more variables at any given time we will be driven to
understand and thus enhance our memory further. It has been shown
scientifically that subliminals can be used to enhance our memory quite
drastically ... yet few people employ them.    
     
It has also been demonstrated how our emotions have a great deal to do
with how well we store information in our memory, thus again further
reason to broaden our focus to inclued emotive modalitities of
consciousness. Greater control of our emotions will allow us to more
effectively employ our memory.

Conditional statements taken to the extreme continue in infinite
regress. The idea here is just to incrementally strive for more, to go a
little further along the causal path.


Deconstruction of the absolute via percieving its conditionality:
 
Most
Absolute : Z = Z

   .     : if Y then Z

   .     : if V then X, then Y, then Z

More     : If (If A then B, then C) and If (V then X, then Y,) then Z
Conditional    

As we develop it will become easier for us to think more conditionally,
less absolutely, and thus more accurately.

The 4 questions you have posed for me John attempt to rhetorically
revert me to the absolute. "Is your statement true or false?" I do not
wish to answer true or false, I want to answer conditionally,
functionally. I want to go beyond the use of absolute terminology. I
admit this will be difficult and not *fully* possible right here and
now, but neither is immortality, but we still strive for it. We are
dynamically optimistic we can attain to it. In many ways my proposed
shift can still prove useful today, with our limited capacity, even if
it must be for the time considered "parasitic on the concept of truth"
as George has called it.

Within my system it is neither true nor false. It is more or less
functional. We apply the sentence in order to determine its degree of
functionality in relation to other sentences. It does not matter if it
is true or false. Those are not terms within the system. Reverting to
truth in this case would be like taking Einsteins theory of relativity
which is created in terms of pure geometry and trying to revert to
Newton's terms of forces. 

> 2) Is it TRUE that your sentence expresses a useful idea?

Within my system it is neither true nor false. By degree, the sentence
is more or less functional in expressing a functional idea.

The answer was neither yes nor no. It cannot be reduced to something so
black and white and absolute.

The answer was neither yes or no. I wrote my sentence for functionality.


Part of the confusion here lies in the word "is". In your system "is"
means equals, or more accurately conjectures to be equal, and either a=b
is true or a=b is false.

In my system, "is" expresses a functional relationship, not an absolute
relationship of equality. As well "=" expresses a functinal
relationship, not an abosulte relationship of equality.

if we are counting objects: 1+1=2 
if two people are copulating to create a child: 1+1=3
if we are expressing mystical union: 1+1=1

It is not functional to say that these are contradictory, they are
merely being applied in different contexts. We have just broadened the
application of mathematics, allowing it to deal with metaphorical
isomorphisms, without hurting its orignal limited use.

Our language itself is saturated in terms of equality. Though it is a
stepping stone, functional for the initial development of science,
logic, and mathematics, I believe that a gradual shift towards
conditional terms and terms of degree rather than terms of absolute
relationship would be to our benefit [would be useful]. 

Our language determines our perception of reality. Words such as the
following engender a black and white percption of the world instead of a
greyscale perception:

Is, are, was, equal, equate, exactly, proven, intrinsic.


(3+4)=(4+3) We can say that these absolutely equal each other, but
really, there is a slight difference. The difference is in the order of
the addition of the numbers. Now, in most cases this difference would
not matter, but perhaps we could imagine a situation where it might,
particularly if we are using mathematics in a more metaphorical sense.
Instead of saying 3+4 equals 4+3, we might say 3+4 functions as 4+3, but
4+3 might in some circumstances function more as 4+3.

  seconds: 0        -->       1.5
statement: Gregory equals Gregory

In the time it took me to make this statement, which most people would
consider self-evident, Gregory changed. The quantity of
neuro-transmitters in his central nervous system changed, his pulse and
temperature probably changed, his position in relation to celestial
bodies changed. Our current level of abstraction lacks subtlety. It is
not an exact science.

Abstraction is necessary. I just think we have taken it too far towards
absolute terms. 

I am going to attempt a sort of discipline which entails that whenever I
become aware of myself making an absolute statement, I am going to
attempt to make it more of a conditional statement, and more of a
statement of degree, than I would have if I were not concerned about
it.   

Many might argue that this will needlessly complexify my thought, speech
and writing. But I would argue, that if employed regularly, this
discipline will likely engender my ability to employ a greater number of
variables, while likely reducing the potential that someone will
misunderstand me due to an over-abstraction, and thus
over-simplification of that which I am communicating. We all probably do
this to a degree, but how about a few more degrees? ... and then a few
more. Perhaps in this fashion we might be able to reach the hypothetical
singularity with less reliance on computers.

I had a philosophy teacher get pissed off at me once for saying "I
believe, or I feel such and such." He said, "Be assertive, state what
you think as if it were a fact!" I then noticed, that yes, this is how
most philosophers write, stating beliefs as if they were absolute facts
or truths. I *believe* this sort of authoritarian thinking is one of the
things limiting our ability to move onward towards higher levels of
emotive, intuitive, and cognitive conditionality.

Many people complain about making things to relative, but we haven't
even hardly begun to move towards relativity, not to mention to find a
balance between it and absolutism.

F=Our focus
A=Absolute Absolutism
R=Absolute Relativity

A <--- F -------------------------------------- [...] -----> R

We are in part limited in our range of position along this spectrum by
our capacity of consciousness, the number of variables we can
simultaneously deal with, and the number of distinct perspectives we can
simultaneously deal with. We are held in place by the limitations of our
language which entail the limitations of our perception.

I am seeking subtle precision, precision in the subtleties of our
thought, speech, and writing. This precision will move us closer in
accord with our dynamic reality and further from authoritarian and
overly abstracted absolutes such as truth.

Both of these fallacies have been sufficiently debunked: the "negative
externalities" myth by Coase's work, and the "standards" idea by the
simple evidence of reality that most standards are private.  It makes
as little sense to me to argue about what kind of legislature is best
as it would to argue how to make the slave trade more efficient.  The use
of force to rule others is evil, period.  The strong burden of proof is
on those who would rule us to prove that /any/ involuntary government is

such argument; most feeble attempts simply assume some premise that
would lead there, and never attempt to justify the premise.

I guess I missed the original explaination, but am I to assume that a
random government is one where all elected or appointed positions are
filled by lottery instead? 

That woud be an interesting SOP, and would at the same time be useful as
a fund raising instrument. Of course, there would need to be some
serious checks and balances to prevent anyone from  just buying enough
tickets to obtain the position by overwhelming odds, say, any one person
can only buy $2,000 in Presidential Lotto Tickets each year or four
years, $10,000 for senate seats, and $50,000 for representative seats
(sue to the dilution of power with more people in the given body, there
is less danger of causing harm.) 

Possibly also, any given law would need to either be passed by two of
three successive congresses, and signed by two of three successive
Presidents to become law, or might even simply be put to a Russian
Roulette type test, where a set percentage of laws are randomly passed,
and another set percentage randomly failed, and the rest must pass by a
supermajority.

Another concept to explore is  Hyperdemocracy, where every voter has
veto power over any law, so the only laws that would pass would be those
that all agree on. Under such a system, since the only laws allowed are
those that all agree do not harm anyone, there is no tyranny of the
majority. Now we do have the case where a law may be passed which harms
no one at a given time, but may harm someone at a later date, possibly
that someone has come of voting age in the meantime. Given this, there
would need to be a sort of ballot initiative mechanism, where if one can
convince a minimum number of people of  the need for a vote on
something, not just to change a law, but to reratify  a law which may
have become burdensome since its inception, then a new vote may be
called, but only after a given period from the original laws enactment.

What is important in such a system is to start off with a minimum number
of laws, possibly just a Bill of Rights.

Both random democracy and hyperdomocracy could be combined, where the
judiciary and executive branches are lottery systems, and the
legislature is everyone in the body politic with an equal veto power.
So becoming a judge, magistrate, soldier, beauraucrat, cabinet
secretary, or President is a position one is drafted for, either
specifically to the job, or from a common pool. There would probably
need to be both, common draft for positions below a certain level, and
specific drafts for the higher level positions, possibly reqiring one to
have been previously drafted from the common pool to a prior position,
to at least acquaint the individual with how the government works, and
possibly also with some professional requirements as well for certain
positions, but not to restrictive.

That's funny, I only unsubscribed tonight (16 Feb).  For technical reasons,
really.  I need Eudora Pro with its filters or else I can't handle the
volume.  I'm sad that Mike Butler quit, he was one of the ones I was

I very much enjoyed Gregory Houston's <vertigo@triberian.com> post and even 
agreed with much of it, but you're causing unnecessary trouble for yourself  
because I think the concept of "THE TRUTH" is functional and so should be  
used.          

        >Our language determines our perception of reality. Words such as the        
        >following engender a black and white percption of the world instead         
        >of a greyscale perception:  Is, are, was, equal, equate, exactly,        
        >proven, intrinsic.
               

I need these words to talk, you used a number of them yourself, even more 
important, I need these concepts to think, because sometimes a black and 
white perception is the way to go.
                       

        >Conditional statements taken to the extreme continue in infinite        
        >regress. The idea here is just to incrementally  strive for more,         
        >to go a little further along the causal path.
                       

If your ideas are correct then as you progress down the causal path toward   
pure mathematics things should become more black and white. I think they do, 
but rather than doing away with truth I would just say that in a complex 
world you need a lot of conditional statements.

I agree with you that functionality is not the same as truth, Einstein may be 
truer but Newton is more useful in some cases, such as building a bridge or  
sending a rocket to the moon.
                       

        >whenever I become aware of myself making an absolute statement, I am         
        >going to attempt to make it more of a conditional statement, and         
        >more of a statement of degree [...]  Many might argue that this will        
        >needlessly complexify my thought, speech and writing. 


You will have to stop the conditionals at some point, otherwise all your 
statements would be of infinite length and you would never be able to  
complete a thought.
                        

        >Many people complain about making things to relative, but we haven't        
        >even hardly begun to move towards relativity, not to mention to find         
        >a balance between it and absolutism.
                        

Even in Einstein's theory not everything is relative, the speed of light is 
an absolute.
                       

        >The statement, "I think therefor I am", is more useful than the        
        >statement, "I am". 


How about  "I think therefore thoughts exist"?
                       

        >Reverting to truth in this case would be like taking Einsteins        
        >theory of relativity which is created in terms of pure geometry and         
        >trying to revert to Newton's terms of forces. 


As speeds become slower and the gravitational field becomes weaker, 
Einstein's  results and Newton's become more and more similar, if they did 
not then nobody would bother with Einstein's theory. We already know that 
Newton's idea works beautifully under everyday conditions, so if Einstein 
didn't reduce to Newton at slow speeds then it would be wrong. In the same 
way your theory must reduce to true or false statement as  things get simpler.                                   

We may not ever be able to find "THE TRUTH" but that doesn't mean it's not 
a useful abstraction, because some things are truer than others. Newton's 
Physics is far, far truer than the physics of Aristotle, and Einstein's 
Physics is Truer than Newton's. Even Einstein is not "THE TRUTH", we already 
know it breaks down when things get very small.

Actually, what our theories do is explain how some sense sensations relate to 
other sense sensations. For example we receive information from our eyes, 
we interpret that information as a rock moving at high speed and heading for 
a large plate glass window, we invent a theory that predicts that very soon 
we will receive another sensation, this time from our ears, that we will 
describe as the sound of breaking glass. Soon our prediction is confirmed so 
the theory is successful, but we should remember that the sound of broken 
glass is not broken glass, the look of broken  glass is not broken glass, 
the feel of broken glass is not broken glass. What "IS" broken glass? 
It must have stable properties of some sort or I wouldn't be able to identify 
it as a "thing", I don't know what those ULTIMATE stable properties are, 
but I know what they are not, they are NOT sense sensations. I have no idea 
what glass "IS". The sad truth is, I can point to "things" but I don't  know 
what a thing "IS"  and I 'm not even sure that I know what "IS" is. 

What are the practical implications of all this?  Zero, near as I can tell, 
it's just fun to think about. Appearances are what's important, ultimate 
reality is for philosophers. As long as I can get the universe to SEEM to 
obey me and operate in a way that pleases me, that's good enough and I'll be 
a happy man. That's not asking too much, now is it?

[SNIP]

I agree it is unrealistic in our present context to remove the concept
of "THE TRUTH". I'm not particulary convinced this would be so for more
highly developed entities. But in any case, by attempting to justify the
extreme stance I have been taking, I hope I have illustrated some points
where science is currently lacking, where some shifts in focus and
priority might prove of monumental benefit. I just ran across the
following quote in this months issue of WIRED. Though WIRED appears to
me to be a trendy corporate oriented magazine, the following quote
seemed serendipitously relevant:    

"If you watch the curve of science and everything we know, it shoots up
like a rocket. We're on this rocket and we're going perfectly vertical
into the stars. But the emotional intelligence of humankind is equally
if not more important than our intellectual intelligence. We're just as
emotionally illiterate as we were 5,000 years ago; so emotionally our
line is completely horizontal. The problem is the horizontal and the
vertical are getting farther and farther apart. And as these things grow
apart, there's going to be some kind of consequence of that." 

--George Lucas, from interview in Febuary 1997 issue of WIRED magazine

With that said, I'm going to take a break, digest some criticism,
consume more information, and incubate some ideas. Thank you for your
discourse.

Cheers,
--

Thought this one would be amusing...

BAGHDAD, Iraq (Feb 17, 1997 12:01 p.m. EST) -- Add this to America's arsenal.

An Iraqi government newspaper has declared the Internet "the end of
civilizations, cultures, interests and ethics."

The computer network "is one of the American means to enter every house in
the world," Al-Jumhuriya said in an editorial Monday. "They want to become
the only source for controlling human beings in the new electronic village."

Iraqi newspapers often blame Washington for the country's suffering under a
U.N. embargo, which was imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait,
prompting the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

There is no access to the Internet in Iraq.

Not cheap. Not at all. The gadgetry can be DIY, but the enzymes?? 
Sephadex, agarose & Co?
Besides, if somebody gets wind of you doing illegal recombinant DNA

recombinant DNA experiments in an unapproved lab make them illegal) you

I wasn't discussing the hypothetical "ultimate lookup table", which would
have all possible conversations recorded.  My point was in reference to any
possible lookup table, which necessarily can have only a very limited set
(and in particular to a table made by recording very many actual
conversations).

With any real table it will be easy to construct a sentence that isn't in its
lookup database, thereby blowing its response and the rest of the
conversation.

I don't mean to single you out here, but I am disturbed by
the lack of resonse to this, so I feel I must comment.

I want to live in a world based on individual sovereignty
and respect for rights, and statements like that above make
that harder.  One cannot demand rights without respecting
those of others.  Either all have rights, or none do.  If
they have a piece of property you want (in this case, access
to their server, which is a contractual privilege that it
costs real money to provide), and their stated price for that
product is a little bit of information, then you must pay
that price honestly or not steal or defraud them of that
product.  Their property--including your use of it--/is/
wholly in their jurisdiction, and no one else's.

And no, I am not coming from an intellectual-property point
of view.  Privileges are real property, not fictions of the
state like copyrights and patents.

"Practical" is a value judgment, and presupposes a standard by which
one must judge what works "well" and what doesn't.  If one's standard
of judgment includes the total repudiation of coercive force, as does
mine, then no coercive solution can be practical by definition.  It
may be difficult to create free-market solutions to some problems, but
I have never found such a problem.  The ones you name above are quite
trivially solved by assigning private property rights in clean air and
healthy oceans to individuals, and letting the market trade itself
into equilibrium; basic A-C 101.

Again, I place the burden of proof where it belongs: on the agents of
force.  I do not care to prove to you that I am free--you must prove
to me that to enslave me is justified.  Resorting to history is no
excuse.  That only proves that slavery is natural and compatible with
our evolutionary design.  I thumb my nose at that nature; I know I can
do better, and I assume that others can as well.

The "steps along the way" argument is not without merit, and I am
sympathetic to libertarians who, for instance, advocate a flat tax or
school vouchers as intermediate steps in the direction of abolishing
taxation and state indoctrination.  I voted for vouchers myself.  But
there is a fine line between manipulating a system that exists in
order to dismantle it later, and buying into the system's fundamental
claim of power and then merely tweaking it.  I think a far better
path is to manipulate the system to the point at which it no longer
is able to interfere with the lives of individual sovereigns trading
among themselves, and then simply ignore it and let it die of its
own weight.  I call that "underthrowing" the government.   All these
ideas like "random democracy" or "hyperdemocracy" start from the
premise that democracy itself is somehow moral, and neither serve
to undermine the power of the system, only to move it around like
shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic.  Democracy doesn't need to be
fixed, it needs to be crippled and then abandoned.

 I don't know of any statistic methods (perhaps some form of knot

<Obviously you need to put a dollar sign on the intangible value of

Inflation indexes, and other economic indicators, can't very well 
include intangible values and still have much usefulness. 
 Furthermore, once you do admit such subjectivity into these things, 
they're immediately subject to political hijacking. That's not to say 
you wouldn't want to have some estimate of the value of staying alive 
to incorporate into whatever process you use to make some decision, 
you just wouldn't want to embed it in what are supposed to be fairly 
objective measures of marketplace trends.

<Once again we are dealing with material goods rather than 
informational goods, so its still out of the issue. Back to megs and 
bauds, you use Moore's laws [Snip] you see that there is significant 
deflation in high technolgies due to technological advancement, and 
the synergies of feeding every new gain into attaining greater gains, 
maintaining a 100% rate increase in productivity every 18  months.>

Mike, you're really talking about productivity here.  I agree, the 
national productivity measures we have are ridiculous, totally 
unsuited for measuring service-sector productivity, let alone the even 
more abstract knowledge industries.  The following is from a Wall 
Street Journal article of August 12, 1992 called 'Dubious Figures: 
Productivity Statistics For the Service Sector May Understate gains":

"Explaining why productivity in many services is 'simply impossible to 
measure', Michael Harper, chief of productivity research at the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, cites the insurance industry. 'Do higher 
premiums, which tend to boost an insurance company's revenues, also 
serve to boost its productivity,' he asks. 'Or are higher premiums 
merely a signal of higher policy risks.'"

Note how important insurance services are to the type of libertarian 
society we hope to create.  The WSJ article also goes on to note:

"Other services whose productivity the BLS finds impossible to measure 
include such major fields as health care, real estate, and stock and 
bond brokerage. In all, services for which no productivity figures are 
available employ nearly 70% of the people with service jobs - far 
higher than the comparable percentage in manufacturing."

Other good example of productivity paradoxes include schools and 
day-care centers where an increase in students per teacher looks like 
a productivity increase but often results in a quality decrease.

<Given this unaccounted for deflation [in cost per baud], it is easy 
to see why the only thing contributing to inflation is COLA payments 
by the government union and pension system that are based on false 
inflation data from the government.>

COLA payments for government-employee pensions are miniscule compared 
to the COLA payments to Social Security recipients in the general 
public.

Also, maybe you didn't check out the cartoon URL I provided but the 
point is that greater baud rates don't yet have much effect on the 
overall cost of living for most people.  According to the BLS Consumer 
Expenditure Survey (for 1991 - the quickest numbers I can get my hands 
on), average expenditures (based on a weighted sample by age-group, 
income-group and area) for the typical consumer are:

14.1%    food
31.2%    housing
5.9%      apparel and services
17.4%    transportation
5.2%      health care
5.0%      entertainment
9.4%      personal insurances and pensions
11.5%    other expenditures

<Are your superiors so incredulous or adamant against acknowledging 
the validity of this deflation due to the fact that they are trying to 
protect their pensions?>

The inflation you identified has to do with producer prices, which 
don't always translate into changes in consumer prices, nor do they 
have anything to do with the bulk of the average person's monthly 
bill.  As I noted, the biggest constituency against adjusting 
inflation measures downward are the elderly in general who want their 
Social Security COLAs.

<If it is acknowledged that there really isnt as much inflation as 
they claim, then the government will not be able to jack up taxes>

The second biggest constituency (in terms of how important it is to 
them), is the middle class, because the CPI is used to adjust their 
tax brackets - the higher the rate of inflation, the lower the tax 
bracket you fall into if your income is unchanged.

You are right that technological advances have had  huge unmeasured 
impacts on manufacturing and service productivity.  So why are costs 
still increasing, even if at a lower rate than the official figures? 
 Well, I suspect that businesses like to keep their productivity 
improvements as proprietary information and, in fact, the currently 
'low' rate of inflation is a proxy for the fact that businesses don't 
have to raise their prices so much because of the productivity 
improvements they've been able to make in recent years.

I urge anyone who hasn't already read the Manifesto and signed it, to please 
do so. By adding your names to this Manifesto you can help drive home the
realization that the future of our art, our creativity andimagination, is 
most clearly understood in terms of extropic thinking.

I have been using Eudora filters for a while now,
and came up with a set that I consider very useful.

some examples (pseudocode) :

 if (subject contains "unsubscribe")
					transfer to "junk";
                              stop filtering;
 if (To: is "me@home.org" unless From: is "me@work.com")
					transfer to "personal";
					play sound "Ta-Da!";
					forward to "me@work.com";
					stop filtering;
 if (body contains "Chislenko" or "Sasha")
					copy to "Sasha cited" folder;
                              keep filtering;
 if (body contains "extrop" unless To: contains "extrop")
                              set label "red";
                              keep filtering;
 ....
 else    transfer to "Misc";

You can also program it to automatically respond to some
messages, or run a small mailing list.

If anybody wants, I can email you my filter as an example;
it has clauses for several dozen mailing lists of extropian
interest, newsletters, etc.  

It would be nice to have some tools for combining filters
and custom dictionaries for a group of people - and then
we could speak of more intelligent collaborative filtering.

You've lost me here.  Investors should move to where the expect higher
returns, just as people should move to where wages are highest.  I
don't see a relation between this and piracy.

We we clearly want some form of social coordination to deal with these
issues, but whether that is a "government" depends on what you mean by
the term.  If everyone in the US had voluntarily agreed to abide by
our current rules, would our "government" deal any worse with these
problems?

You could now run for office on a platform that if elected, you will
replace yourself with a randomly selected member of your electorate.
Since people do not now run on such platforms, I suspect that voters
do not in fact trust such a random person to do as well.  Also, voters
can't be as skeptical as you regarding the information value of
advertizing, or they wouldn't be persuaded by it.

I believe that about a century ago, prussia or poland required
legislative unanimity to pass laws.  I think a neighboring country
then only had to buy out a single legislator to ensure insufficient
national defense.  Not a good example to follow.

I'm not sure what you mean by "debunked".  Coase has certainly not
proved that torts do better than legislatures at dealing with
externalities and public goods/bads.

Given that we had a slave trade, it would indeed make sense to argue
about how to make it more efficient.  And since we do in fact have
legislatures, it makes sense to argue about how to make them better.

"Burden of proof"?  "necessary"?  There are governments now.  If you
want to convince people to work to get rid of them, you have to
convince people they would like their circumstances substantially
better without a government.  Baldface claims that govts are
"evil" are not going to get you very far toward this goal.

I don't see anything more exciting about the Tipler scenario than
about the Dyson scenario. Boredom and excitement are not a function
of ones environment but a function of how well or poorly adapted
one is to the most recent changes in ones environment. Maladaptation
is easy to produce, because new challenges are fairly easy to find,
particularly when ones goals are centered around self-creation
and self-improvement.

A side note on Reilly and Gregory's debate on truth. Truth is a
guiding ideal that has evolved over time. I don't think that it is
a condition that we can use descriptively of anything; rather, I
think it is a condition that we aspire to, and that aspiring to
this condition has been quite helpful to us in our projects so far.
To have the truth: that is something to strive for, not something
to claim that one has achieved.  Richard Rorty recommends that we
bag the notion of truth for disposal because we do not understand
it and because the notion has been used in a destructive way in
some debates, but I still think Rorty is foolhardy in his exhortation.
Let's not rip up and shred *all* of the traditions that have gotten
us this far, at least not until we're sure we understand how they
are helpful to us as well as how they are harmful to us. I tend to
be quite sceptical of claims to understanding of that sort, because
I don't think we have reached that stage in our discussion of truth
yet.  So far I see people either idolatrizing truth or demonizing
it...  real analysis will begin once people start looking at both
the useful and the disadvantageous sides of our guiding ideal, our
love of truth. It is not our only guiding ideal.

By "a guiding ideal that has evolved over time", I mean a poorly
understood active information structure encoded in human brains
that has developed mostly through a process of cultural (meme?)
evolution that could very easily have been entirely beyond the ken
of the people in whose brains the development was taking place.
An unintended consequence, like most of the good things in life.
I try to keep my discussion of such things as "truth" fairly
concrete; it seems to me to be the only way to proceed in investigating
something that has resisted investigation for so many millenia.
This is why I agree so emphatically with the Churchlands that
philosophers in our day and age need to attend to neuroscientific
data and neuroscientific theory.

So in your book it doesn't make any sense to argue about whether or not

This is bad evidence, because legislators cannot replace themselves
with whomever they like. In the US federal House of Representatives,
a legislator can resign at will, but the replacement is chosen by
a special election called by the executive authority of the state
from which the legislator was elected. Similar schemes are in effect
in most other polities with representative legislatures.

Again, that presupposes a definition of "better".  What Coase showed
was that in a free market, the very idea of "public good" is a myth.
Any initial assignment of property rights will result in an efficient
solution in a free market, subject only to transaction costs.  It is
true that perhaps some tort-law methods might have higher transaction
costs than some legislative methods, and in that sense be less
efficient.  I do not for a moment concede that there exist any social
problems for which /no/ free market solution exists that is better
in that sense than a legislative one.  If I find one, I would still 
be inclined to suffer that cost rather than a legislature, but I
haven't found one yet.

Slavery exists today.  Americans call it the draft, Muslim nations
call it marriage, the Chinese call it prison.  That doesn't mean I'm
going to spend any energy on how to conduct the draft with less money,
or whether women should be included.  The draft is wrong.  The only
way to improve it is to abolish it, and any steps I take will be in
that direction only.

All of that convincing is done well by many popular authors, just as
they convinced me.  But I tend to associate with those who are already
predisposed to liberty; libertarians, extropians, objectivists, et al.
I do not play the role of persuader there--I play the role of extremist.
Someone has to be.  We do have an ultimate goal, and I want to make
sure that my fellow activists for liberty don't lost sight of the goal
while they manipulate the existing system.

I just got this from a friend on the pigdog list, who tells me that
AP released it yesterday (96/2/17). It looks legit to me, so I'm
forwarding it without checking the background or source. Just
another bit of scare-story for space activists to use to attract
people's attention (sounds cynical, but I think it's a good thing).

------- Forwarded Message

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists who drilled core samples from the ocean bed
said Sunday they have found proof that a huge asteroid smashed into the
Earth 65 million years ago and probably killed off the dinosaurs. 

"We've got the smoking gun," said Richard D. Norris, leader of an
international ocean drilling expedition that probed the Atlantic Ocean
floor in search of asteroid evidence. "It is proof positive of the
impact." 

Norris said the expedition recovered three drill samples that have the
unmistakable signature of an asteroid impact about 65 million years ago.
The drill cores include a thin brownish section that the scientists called
the "fireball layer" because it is thought to contain bits of the asteroid
itself.

'It is proof positive' "These neat layers of sediment bracketing the
impact have never been found in the sea before," Norris said in a
telephone interview.  "It is proof positive of the impact." 

The scientists, working on the drill ship Joides Resolution, spent five
weeks off the east coast of Florida collecting cores from the ocean floor
in about 8,500 feet of water. The team penetrated up to 300 feet beneath
the sea bed, drilling past sediments laid down at the time of the dinosaur
extinction. 

Norris said the deepest layers contain fossil remains of many animals and
came from a healthy "happy-go-lucky ocean" just before the impact. 

Just above this is a layer with small green glass pebbles, thought to be
ocean bottom material instantly melted by the massive energy release of
the impact. 

Next was a rusty brown layer which Norris said is thought to be from the
"vaporized remains of the asteroid itself." 

The heat of the impact would have been so intense, said Norris, that the
stony asteroid would have instantly been reduced to vapor and thrown high
into the sky, some of it perhaps even reaching outer space. It then snowed
down, like a fine powder, all over the globe. Norris said brown deposits,
like that in the core sample, have been found elsewhere and they have a
high content of iridium, a chemical signature of asteroids. 

Just above the brown layer, is two inches of gray clay with strong
evidence of a nearly dead world. 

"It was not a completely dead ocean, but most of the species that are seen
before (early in the core sample) are gone," said Norris.  "There are just
some very minute fossils. These were the survivors in the ocean." 

This dead zone lasted about 5,000 years, said the scientist, and then the
core samples showed evidence of renewed life. 

"It is amazing how quickly the new species appeared," he said. 

Although the dinosaur-killing impact occurred in the southern Gulf of
Mexico, Norris went to the Atlantic Ocean, near the edge of the
Continental Shelf. He said that the violence of the impact, followed by
huge waves, roiled the Gulf of Mexico so much that it is unlikely clear
core samples would be found there. 

He said he theorized that waves from the impact would have washed
completely across Florida, depositing debris in the Atlantic. And that's
where he found it. 

'The most significant discovery' in 20 years

Robert W. Corell, assistant director for Geosciences of the National
Science Foundation, said the core samples are the strongest evidence yet
that an asteroid impact caused the extinction. 

"In my view, this is the most significant discovery in geosciences in 20
years," he said, also in a telephone interview. "This gives us the facts
of what happened to life back then. I would certainly call it the smoking
gun." 

Geologist Walter Alvarez of the University of California, Berkeley, first
proposed in 1980 that the dinosaurs disappeared from fossil history
suddenly because of a massive asteroid hit. At first, the theory had few
supporters. 

But in 1989, scientists found evidence of a huge impact crater north of
Chicxulub, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Later studies found evidence of
debris washed out of the Gulf by waves that went inland as far as what is
now Arkansas. 

It's now widely believed that an asteroid of 6 to 12 miles in diameter
smashed into Earth at thousands of miles per hour. It instantly gouged a
crater 150 to 180 miles wide. 

That energy release was more powerful than if all of the nuclear weapons
ever made were set off at once, said Norris. 

Billions of tons of soil, sulfur and rock vapor were lifted into the
atmosphere, blotting out the sun. Temperatures around the globe plunged. 

Up to 70 percent of all species, including the dinosaurs, perished.  Among
the survivors, scientists believe, were small mammals that, over millions
of years, evolved into many new species, including humans.

The very idea of a public good does not imply anything else, and so is
not a myth.  The standard economic concept of a public good is only
meant to delimit a certain set of situations, and does by itself imply
what the best way to deal with them is.

The candidate could still agree to, if elected, vote/etc. exactly as
directed by this randomly selected citizen.  Violations of this
agreement should be pretty easy to detect.

About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission took the
astronauts near Tuba City where the terrain of the Navajo Reservation looks
very much like the Lunar surface.  Along with all the trucks and large
vehicles, there were two large figures dressed in full Lunar spacesuits.

Nearby a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange creatures
walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel.  The two Navajo people
were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel.  Since the man did not
know English, his son asked for him what the strange creatures were and the
NASA people told them that they are just men that are getting ready to go to
the moon.  The man became very excited and asked if he could send a message
to the moon with the astronauts.

The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a tape
recorder.  After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to

Later, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate and every

You could, however, run on the platform that you would randomly
select some citizen and allow him to make all your voting decisions.
That would at least work until you were recalled (which I think
would be likely).  I am still not optimistic that those votes would
be any less heinous than those of an elected official himself--in
fact, I'm quite sure they would not be.  The masses today believe
in all kinds of nonsense.

When I lived in Seattle, a man changed his name to "Absolutely
Nobody" and ran for Lieutenant Governor.  He promised that if he
were elected, he would return his salary and never show up for work.
There's a tweak to democracy I might support--a definite step in
the right direction.

It also served to allow me to say something to our LP candidate
that one rarely gets to say--"Congratulations, Tom, nobody got more
votes than you did."

Your response clarifies that you meant (I think) that investors should

that's where they could get the highest returns.

It seems to me, though, that investors like to diversify.  Even if 
they know (and it's doubtful that they had the kind of quantified

might not want to put all their eggs in one basket.  I would think 
this overseas "adventurism", despite more assured investments at home, 
implies that investors aren't always completely rational, that they 
are willing to take risks and be pioneers in new markets.

I was organizing some of my note files over the weekend and found this

I don't know if Tversky or others have also shown that people act 
irrationally when they are willing to take risks in new areas.

Haveing now spent several years in pursuit of a Ph.D. in political
economy, the following observation stands out to me as the most
puzzling:   Why do people seem so damn confident of their political
opinions?   

On topics such as physics or computers, most people are willing, even
anxious to admit that they don't know very much, and they are willing
to defer to a surprizing degree to people who specialize in such topics.

On political topics, however, most people hold surprizingly many
opinions, seem remarkably confident in those opinions, and seem
unwilling to defer to people who spend their lives studing such
topics.  They are even most unwilling to grant that people with
contrary opinions may know something that they don't.  This holds most
directly for political science, but also for related areas of
economics and sociology.

I see this behavior on this list as well.   Why?  Why so few
qualifiers and "I don't know"s on political topics?  

Yes, of course part of what brings us together is an interest in
anarcho-capitalist type political institutions.  But why are so many
of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually
function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  

Social systems are perhaps the most complex systems we know, and for
which our ignornance should be the most vivid.  Why is this so hard to
admit?

Every definition of "public good" I've seen in economics texts defines
it specifically to imply those things that the free market cannot
provide, because they benefit many who did not pay for their creation.
It is usually implied that taxation is therefore the only way to fund
such things.  It is this concept, not just the words "public good" in
general, that Coase's work undermines, and to which I referred.

A couple of possibilities come to mind. People may feel more qualified to
give opinions on politics than they do on say, physics, because politics
(of some form) is inextricably linked with the social structures to which
they belong. That is, they perceive politics having much more of a direct
impact on their lives than physics theories or formulae do, and hence feel
they are in a better position to comment on political issues.

Whether they really are in such a better position is, of course, another
matter.

Another explanation might be that people figure that social/political
studies aren't really "science", in that the researchers are often
prevented by ethics (and law) from setting up the tightly-controlled
experimental conditions available to some other sciences.

Because the stakes are so high.

There are only a few individuals out of the mass of society who
are likely to use violence to mess my life up. There are the
criminals, whom I rarely encounter and whom my friends and neighbors
will readily help me oppose, and there are the government, whom I
encounter on a daily basis and whom my friends and neighbors are
afraid to oppose openly because they don't want to go to prison or
get shot any more than I do.

People are much more willing to use epistemic caution in debates where
they aren't afraid that they have a lot to lose, if they lose. The only
time I ever feel even *close* to the sensation that I am arguing for my
life is when I'm in political arguments. I've worn handcuffs, I've had
my room destroyed in a drug search (this was when I was very young),
I've seen innocent young men and women shipped off to rot in prison.
People do not argue calmly when they are arguing about the rights and
responsibilities of the person who is holding a gun to their head, and
that seems pretty straightforward to me.

I find this a satisfying explanation of the phenomenon you pointed out,
but now that you've pointed it out to me, I'm going to give some thought
to changing my ways a bit. I don't promise that I'm going to change my
ways, just that I'm going to give it some thought.

San Jose Mercury? I don't know much about it, but I've seen reliable
stories from it before. I also saw an AP article a couple of years ago
about a DEA seizure of a ton of cocaine which was bounced by the CIA
because they were importing it for some drug gang that they wanted help
from. I probably still have the details on a CD-ROM somewhere, but not
handy; I particularly remember it because it was the first time I'd seen
such a story from such a (relatively) reliable source. There might be a 
copy somewhere on the Web.

Leary did pretty well when he was treating criminals with LSD, but I don't
think they were particularly violent. AFAIR many of them did end up back
in prison eventually, but mostly for parole violations rather than new
crimes. I think the full details are somewhere in the hyperreal archives.

Physicists and programmers can readily point to simple, repeatable
experiments that conclusively demonstrate their principles.  Someone
who didn't want to believe that electricity comes in discrete chunks
needs only to set up Millikan's oil-drop apparatus and see for himself.
A program either produces correct output or it does not.  It is not
subject to interpretation or outside influence.

Political "truths" are not on such solid ground.  Certainly, some
things can be tested, such as computer simulations of economic models.
Even then, the models must make some assumptions about human behavior,
which is notoriously not amenable to precise simulation.  One can
also look to some degree at historical data, but even that is subject
to thousands of overlapping factors, human whims, and historical lies.
Finally, political ideas often rest on normative foundations, so
people with different norms will not agree, regardless of how much
deduction one does from them.

That's why I may appear, in your words, "confident"; perhaps even
dogmatic.  It's not that I am unwilling to be convinced otherwise,
it's just that doing so is extraordinarily more difficult than in
clearer fields like physics.

I am quite willing to defer to your years of education in describing
how existing governments function, or what the results of certain
changes might be, and even what the historical record of governance
tells us about human nature.  But all that doesn't change my free
will, or my free choice to rise above my nature and form a society
by completely different rules.  To move me, you must appeal to my
moral philosophy directly--you must convince me that my moral choices
will result in something even worse than the bloody tyrannies I have
seen every other philosophy degrade to.

I don't have a problem admitting that I don't know how any particular
A-C system would operate in real life, and I am quite willing to admit
that there are gaps like intellectual property and land covenants and
child care that aren't all neatly tied up in a working package.  But
still, none of that changes the moral foundations, which, in the end,
are a matter of choice.  One can reason /from/ them--one can reason
that certain moral codes are likely to produce certain results, and
that if those results are undesirable, one should change the normative
axioms.  But one cannot reason /toward/ a moral choice.  In the end,
the desirability of means and ends is a value, a free choice.

Individual liberty and responsibility are axiomatic values for me.
I believe they will result in a system that minimizes coercive force,
which is also an axiomatic value.  Arguments can be made that I am
wrong, that my axioms will lead to results other than what I expect,
but to prove that to me is much more difficult than just pointing me
to an oil-drop experiment.  We can't just set up two planets and
watch for a millennium.

Varian, "Microeconomic Analysis" was the standard grad econ text until
recently.  In the 3rd edition p. 414, starting the chapter titled
"public goods", it gives this definition:

  "We say that a good is excludable if people can be excluded from
   consuming it.  We say that a good is nonrival if one person's
   consumption does not reduce the amount available to other consumers. ...
   Goods that are not excludable and are nonrival are called public goods."

Ah, yes. Another answer to Robin's question is that our society is
permeated with the Dogma of Democracy, and the Dogma of Democracy
is that any randomly chosen citizen's opinion about a political
issue is exactly as valuable and likely to be "true" as anyone
else's opinion of that issue. Therefore, each of us can expound
and hold forth on our political opinions without any shred of
epistemic responsibility, and since this is the attitude that
everyone else takes, thanks to their democratic religious beliefs,
I end up mirroring this attitude toward my opponents in debate.

So ultimately, as with so many other stupidities, it comes down to
a question of religious belief.

        That is exactly it.  Politics ultimately affect life in some way or
another.  Many would argue that life itself is a politic.  People must know
where they stand in life --know what limits and freedoms they accurately
possess.  In application to libertarianism, those who are at least in accord
with the politic have no desire for limitations in life.
They (and I am one of them) want to be under a thumb as little as possible,
and in effect, are confident that libertarianism is the way to
achieve this.  Show me a politic that will attain freedom in a better way,
and I will strongly consider changing politics.

        On a more personal level, I am planning on moving to California
before the end of the year; the reasons vary, though I guarantee that
politics have a lot of bearing on my plans.  I am willing to attain my
freedoms...and this includes moving to where the potential of opportunity
is vastening.  I am confident of my political opinions because I am
confident in myself --the broadest horizons are within oneself, and though
the stakes are high, it boils down to another question of faith or
freedom...and I'll take the latter, thanks.

Probably because, IMHUQO, people tend to base their political opinions
on their own experiences, they know what doesn't work, what does work,
and what is likely to benefit them as individuals or members of a group.
Democracy for example has more to do with people each choosing their own
self interest than in people choosing what is good for all. THe choices
balance out in a vote to decide what is best for the majority. Due to a
life of parcticed or feigned exercise of political rights, people become
pretty confident in their own judgement of politics. 

Conversely, when was the last time the average joe got a chance to bake
a quark for breakfast?

While I may share your sentiments, and would love to live an ungoverned
life, I cannot realistically or practically see a way to get there from
here. Using such methods as random democracy as a first step, and
random/hyperdemocracy as a second step are in my opinion necessary to
peacfully achieve the transition as peacefully as possible, if it is
possible. Think about it, a world where everyone has a veto power
against new laws is essentially an ungoverned anarchy, so long as the
system starts out with as few laws as possible, if not any at all. Given
this, only mutually accepted voluntary standards will exist, so there is
the possiblity of competing standards of behavior, which allows much
acceleration in the cultural rate of evolution and diversification. This
will also allow the development of minimum standards of communications
that can be used to communicate across cultures,nations, individuals,
groups, what have you. Those that wish to remain isolated are fully free
to do so, while all groups will be able to develope standards of
communication that are optimum for their group.

The solution is to operate with more than one type of lookup table, sort
of a super thesaurus/dictionary. One table for definitions, one for
synonyms, one for antonyms, slang, plus grammatical logic, as well as a
mathematics/english translator (which can for example extract data and
operators from a paragraph structure for actual calculation).

Given this, one such AI could even deal with new information by
analysing it and analogizing it to existing knowledge.

Yes, both U.S. and foreign investors should have preferred to invest
here, had they expected free markets to help U.S. investments so.

I don't think desires to diversification can explain this difference
in returns, absent any increased riskiness of U.S. investments.
Standard finance theories just don't support this.

When I first heard of an impending radio interview with Constance 
Buchanan, Assoc. Dean at Harvard Divinity School and founder of the 
women's studies' department there, I thought, 'this will be good for 
a few laughs'.  Instead, it was a fascinating hour in which Buchanan 
made a call for continuing to dismantle the underlying cultural norms 
that have been based in religious belief (I half-expected for her to 
use the word entropy) and developing new leadership and authority 
models based on full public agency for everyone.

In her book _Choosing to Lead:  Women and the Crisis in American 
Values_, she reveals the continuing influence of the Christian 
religion on secular society and in particular our cultural norms 
regarding who has a cultural authority to speak in public regarding 
the way our social interactions will be structured and carried out.
It also contains some interesting critiques on the increasingly 
narrow scope of feminism.

In my notes I stated an application to transhumans/extropians:  
It is clear that merely rejecting religion is not sufficient to free 
ourselves from its effects.  What remaining vestiges of this 
Judeo-Christian cultural map do we continue to play into in our everyday 
lives, and are we willing to accept changes based on eradicting those 
vestiges?

And what are the stakes?  Power, authority, influence, and face.  
Politics and money are merely tools towards these ends, and players 
are not willing to concede ignorance on any point when this would 
give a competitor an advantage in acquiring them.  (But isn't that 
basic political economy?)

By your reasoning, to get rid of slavery one would have had to convince
people that they would have liked their circumstances substantially
better without owning slaves.  Well, maybe you could have convinced them
of this, maybe not.  But isn't this missing something? Surely the claim
that slavery is evil stands on its own, and likewise re. govt.?

It just makes no sense at all to argue about how to make something evil
more efficient, whether we've got it at present or not.

Calm vs. excitement is not the same as caution vs. confidence.  Why
should being excited make you feel confident?  Any why would/does
confidence help you win arguments?

This seems to just restate the puzzle, rather than explaining it.

People believe that cars and planes have a direct impact on their

these safe/efficient etc.

People are largely willing to defer to pychotherapists regarding the
treatment of the mentall ill.  They also defer to geographers and
astronomers, who can hardly control experimental conditions.


Lee Daniel Crocker replies:

Programmers?  Most people believe all sorts of crap that computer
salespeople tell them, even though repeatable experiments often
demonstrate the opposite.  The vast majority of programmer claims out
there are of the form "We can write software to do X in Y months",
which are rarely repeatably experimented on.

Most policy specialists acknowledge that in fact most political policy
questions end up turning much more on questions of fact than on
fundamental normative disagreements.  Very few take your
moral-axiomatic approach to politics.  I think the same response
applies to E. Shaun Russell's reply:

Sounds like you have faith in freedom to me.

Interesting.  That is a more useful definition than the one I'm used
to, and if it is indeed a standard text, I should start using it.  It
doesn't quite fit some old examples of public good, though, like law
enforcement, because they are not nonrival.  Does this book have a
specific term for "commons", i.e., non-excludable, rival goods?

But why would feigning such an exaggerated overconfidence help you
over a competitor?  (Imagine a toothpaste ad with testimonials of how
switching to their brand was the key to getting promoted, into med
school, winning a Nobel prize, becoming president, etc.)  And if it
did, why would the size of the stakes matter?  Wouldn't the same
strategy give an advantage when smaller stakes were at play?

Come on, physics is about lots of very useful stuff like momentum, E&M
radiation, heat diffusion, etc. which touch lots of lives in lots of
ways, and yet most people will defer to experts on these topics.

What happened is that people were informed in more vivid detail about
the conditions of life of real slaves, which convinced them that they
didn't want to live in a state/nation/etc where those sort of things
happen to people.  Concrete facts were more persuasive that abstract
arguments about what is or is not "evil" in principle.

Here's a news flash: it may not be possible to eliminate all evils in
the world anytime soon.  Even if war is evil, for example, it makes
sense to seek ways so wars kill fewer people when the happen.

Well, duh.  If you write an AI that can understand English, it can understand
English.  But the sort of thing you describe is very difficult (none of it
has been done; you need much more than just lists of synonyms to use them;
you also need and understanding of how the words differ in connotation).  The
intelligence here would be coming from places other than the lookup table of
conversations.  Indeed, it really wouldn't need a conversation lookup table
at all, anymore than we do.

The stakes are life, liberty, and property.  I'm quite willing to
concede ignorance, but I am not willing to concede that my freedom
exists solely at the whim of my neighbors.  Politicians may be
playing games for authority, but the innocent people killed and
jailed by them aren't.

If I am dead or enslaved, it makes no difference to me whether I was
mudered by a gun-toting thug or by vote-casting democrats.  I must
protect myself from both.  Since there is no period in human history
where criminals killed more innocent people than did governments,
that is the enemy I concentrate on.

Interesting.  Is that the kind of thing taught in "computer science"
classes these days?  Nebulous ideas about methodology and scheduling?
I honestly don't know; my 16 years of programming experience do not
include any formal education.  Never had any use for it.  They hire me
to write stuff.  It either works or it doesn't.  Very testable, clear,
and scientific.

But even if we remove that example from the argument, I still think it
holds: politics is a less testable science, and therefore an easier
subject for passionate advocates to flourish in with less risk of being
disproved. 

After seeing the other replies, though, I think Eric's "high stakes"
argument is more compelling (not that they compete).  Politicians are
playing with real people's lives.  If one has reached some conclusion--
right or wrong--about what political system is best, one is naturally
driven to be evangelical and inflexible, because you will view its
competing ideas as deadly.

This is precisely why I like to take on popular ideas aggressively.
I like to shake up the mental cobwebs a bit, attack ideas head-on.
Eric and I had a related exchange on argumentation techniques just
a few weeks ago; you might look that up in the archives (I changed
the thread title to "The Game of Argument", but there was earlier
stuff under a title I don't remember).

Oh, come now.  Do you seriously suggest that throughout the centuries
of slavery in every society in the world, that the people were just
/uninformed/ about what it was like?   That argument might explain why
it took US consumers a while to catch on to child labor in the third
world, but you can bet your last greenback that everyone in Guatemala
knows exactly what goes on in a sweatshop, and they approve.  Americans
always knew exactly what slavery was, just as every other enslaver in
history has, they simply chose to approve of it and justify it until
the moral opposition gained enough power to change it.

Now you are asking questions about the cognitive and performative
functions of the amygdala and others parts of the brain.  In my
experience, people do assume a much more confident tone in
argumentation when they are excited about what they are arguing,
and people who have a confident tone in argumentation tend to win
over the less thoughtful spectators, some of whom vote. So there
is an incentive structure here as well. It's not much of an incentive
on its own, but given that people argue anyway because they enjoy
it, this might be enough of an incentive to skew how they argue.

Robin replied:

Yes, but it makes it clearer that this is a historical puzzle. The
current widespread belief in majority-rule dogmas *may* be explicable
only as a result of accidents of history. Do current political
economists acknowledge accidents of history? I would expect that
as political economy matures, it would acknowledge the diachronic
as well as the synchronic aspects of the field.

When I try to approach questions like this one seriously, I don't
try to answer them just by looking at current conditions (though
I'm glad that there are some people working on the problem who *do*
discipline their inquiries in that way). What I do is study history
and try to figure out what happened to the development of the family
of liberal political ideologies between the early nineteenth century
and the mid twentieth century. It's a nasty can of worms. But the
dogma of majority rule got entrenched in North America and Europe
during the nineteenth century, for the most part, and then just
kind of exploded and washed over the world after the end of World
War II. Or at least that's how it looks from where I sit. (See,
now I'm doing the same kind of "collectivist thinking" I was just
chiding Reilly about... hmm.)

By "majority rule", I mean specifically the idea that minorities
in a society ought to submit to the will of majorities in a society,
not the practice of using majority rule in voluntary organizations
and small parliamentary bodies. And lest this be misconstrued, I
should mention that I don't care for minority rule either. I think
government, if it exists, should be very careful to preserve a
distinction between the law and the will of the majority, and our
current political system is doing a very poor job of preserving
that distinction.

Robin also replied to Ken Kittlitz:

I know I'm taking this out of context, but cars and planes are not
agents, and people are not generally forced to ride in them and
fly in them if they don't want to.

Those "experts" in physics have proven themselves worthy of my
deference: my microwave heats soup quite well, my car gets me to
work, we even landed on the moon.

The "experts" in politics released 180,000 sex offenders last year
to make room for innocent drug users.  The "experts" sent young men
to die on foreign soil, did radiation experiments on citizens, put
Japanese-Americans in internment camps, murdered women and children
at Waco, and did it all by taking half my earnings at gunpoint.

That's three reasons so far for political arguments to be intense:
1. Low testability of hypotheses
2. High stakes
3. Experts' history of failure

Perhaps libertarians should set up pen-pal relationships with people who
are in prison for victimless crimes such as tax evasion, drug dealing,
etc. That would give them something concretely unpleasant to talk about
in vivid detail during their political arguments with their friends.
I think that there are programs of this sort being run by various
anti-Prohibition activist groups. Then there could be more annual
memorials for the people who are shot and killed by law enforcement
agents for no good reason. (Donald Cole? I'm having trouble remembering
his name, and he didn't pop up in Altavista.)

It just gets tiring having to keep concrete examples of the evils of
the world in mind for the sake of winning arguments. But I guess if the
nineteenth-century abolitionists put themselves through it...

Do you want reasons for a rational person to be confident when excited,
or evolutionary reasons why people would act that way?  If you seem
confident your opponent may decide you know what you're talking about
and back down, to avoid explicitly losing and showing their ignorance.[1]
The more important something is the more you want to feel confident to
win.  The more important something is, the more excited and worried you
will be about winning it.  

So when arguing over the rights of gov't we get excited because the
issue affects our lives so greatly, and confident to make the other
person back down.

Cars and planes aren't so pervasive as gov't.

Maybe you'll like this one better: the existence of expertise in social
issues is harder to see.  Or: people are so ignorant about these issues
they don't know how ignorant they are, and don't perceive any obvious
effects of alleged expertise in these areas (an auto mechanic obviously
fixes your car, but what unambiguous results have economists publicly
produced?)

As for the specific field of amateur libertarian philosophers, perhaps intro
economics courses present free market theory as a simple and tidy
whole, with some mention of complications (axioms, monopolistic
competition) but too weak emphasis.  So people come away feeling they
know The Answers.  At the moment I'm learning more about law and
economics and becoming less confident.  I only learned of the Coase
theorem a few days ago (and have seen it mentioned twice since, ack) and
blight me if I know what the full implications of it are.

What's fun is trying to argue the possibility of anarchy with opponents
who don't know anything more than intro econ themselves, and thing that
is what I'm arguing from.  Actually those arguments really depend on
intuition -- theirs says anarchy is a silly idea, which is a natural
feeling to have from existing in society; mine is influenced by the
iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, natural selection, simulated annealing,
neural networks, anthills, and market theory, after all of which I find
it more possible to believe there might be some stable human anarchy.
They don't have this intuition.  Progress is difficult.

[1] If economists have to convinced that people don't like losing face,
I quit.  I think that's a basic observation.

Because the basic American ideal of political leadership is based on an 
authoritarian model, hence the intractable positions of the two major 
political parties and the blowhard style of debate in Congress.  If you 
will notice, it is only when the President calls for bipartisan action 
that the two parties begin to negotiate on the same side of the table--he 
provides the mechanism by which neither side loses face or authority.
(my major is in poli sci and I did some political campaign work here 
in Washington, just so you know where I'm coming from on this).

Conflict theory states that the items that are less important to each 
side lend themselves to multiple avenues of negotiation, whereas 
parties tend to become entrenched on the bigger, or underlying issues 
involving face, power, authority, or influence.  It's definitely a 
complex question, and one that literature is just beginning to appear 
on.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The possibility that a Quantum Computer might be built in the foreseeable 
future has even started to seep into the mainstream press, there is an
article about them in today's (Feb. 18 1997) New York Times. There are no
new facts the article, but it does contain several quotations I have not seen 
before that express the air of enthusiasm and optimism currently in the field. 

Dr. Raymond Laflamme at the  Los Alamos Laboratory says:

 "Just a few years ago it was thought that a Quantum Computer was impossible.  
  Now we have passes some big stumbling blocks. The possibilities are very  
  exciting."

Dr. Seth Lloyd at MIT says:
    
 "Although large hurdles lie ahead, Quantum Computers are coming tantalizingly
  close to being something that might work".

I thought the most interesting quote came from Rolf W Landauer at IBM.  
Dr. Landauer was probably the most vocal critic of the entire idea of a 
Quantum Computer, and he makes it clear that he is still not convinced that 
such a machine will ever be practical. He does admit however that in late 
1995 when Dr. Peter Shor of ATT proved that Quantum Error correction was not
impossible after all and actually produced such a scheme, and when a few 
months later Dr. Wojciech Zurek at Los Alamos considerably improved it:

 "Nobody was more surprised than I was. I had been too pessimistic, it's  
 just that simple".

To remind you of the stakes that are involved, a 2000 cubit Quantum Computer 
would be far more powerful than a Nano computer made with all the matter in 
the observable universe.

Pardon me for being crude, but I don't recall anyone mentioning that we
are hard-wired to be political. We're mammals, that's why we don't defer to
political experts.

Scientists and philosophers are viewed, on a visceral level, as people that
don't pose much of a threat to our territory. They are perceived as less likely
to make off with our mates, and their brain over braun development makes them
easy to beat up.

Political leaders, on the other hand, are more likely to be alpha male types
and deference to them instantly gives us lowered status within the tribe.

Deference to experts in scientific matters doesn't threaten our status. I
realize we should be beyond all this, and that this may be a very "male"
viewpoint.

Thanks,
	-Mike

Robin Hanson asks:

>Why do people seem so damn confident of their political
>opinions? 

He contrasts this confidence with the self-doubt freely expressed in the
"harder" sciences.

Assuming Robin's observation holds true, I'd posit two causes:

1) Relative indeterminancy.  The sciences have widely-accepted and effective
means to root out error.  Due to the difficulties of creating double-blind,
replicable experiments, and the profusion of variables, political scientists
have a comparatively harder time defending their claims.  Political thinkers
(especially, in contrast to Robin, amateurs) fall back on force of opinion as
a signal of veracity.

2) Relative risks of error.  If physicists err in matters of phlogiston or
caloric, they at worst merely slow technical advances.  If politicians err in
matters of public or foreign policy, they put my life, and the lives of my
loved ones, at grave risk.  People thus perhaps hew to strong political
beliefs because the risk of suffering others' errors seems so grave.  Few
people regard the risks of their *own* political error with equal horror,
since they pick their beliefs with an eye to self-interest.  In other words,
if you err in your political beliefs, I could suffer horribly.  If I err,
*you* might suffer horribly but *I* would probably still end up better off
than I would under your erroneous schemes.

          Robin Hanson:
          
          >Why do people seem so damn confident of their political 
          >opinions?
          
          There must be many factors that play a part. Here are some 
          speculations:
          
          1. People believe that something like Western democracy is a 
          good thing, perhaps because they compare it to other 
          political systems that have been tried in the past and found 
          worse.
          
          2. Western democracy functions by means of a class of 
          politicians want to be elected. They are elected if they 
          succeede in convincing the populace that their particular 
          policy would be good.
          
          3. A politician who appears to be confident about his views 
          tend to be more convincing than one who appears hesitant, 
          uncertain, and who frequently points out weak spots in his 
          own argument.
          
          4. So politicians become confident, through precept as well 
          as though voter's selection.
          
          5. When the public sees all the great names in politics 
          appearing very confident, it tend to believe that that is 
          the proper way to argue politics, and it immitates.
          
          6. Moreover, many people believe that political science is 
          much less advanced than physics, say, so that they regard it 
          as more legitimate to have stong views about politics 
          without having studied political science than to have strong 
          views about controversial physical phenomena whithout having 
          studied physics. In any case, the academic experts typically 
          fail to come forth with an unanimous view on controversial 
          political issues.
          
          7. People tend to associate according to political outlook 
          (I guess), and so their views become reinforced by an 
          external positive feedback loop.
          
          8. Since the top politicians (who in the public's view are 
          the political authorities) are usually not selected for 
          their outstanding knowledge of political or social science 
          etc., but rather for carisma and such, the public tend to 
          believe that knowledge of political science is not very 
          relevant to politics.
          
          9. People are encouraged to form their own political 
          opinions, perhaps because that is regarded as beneficial for 
          a democratic system. Non-voters are derided.
          
          10. Many political disagrements are based on fundamental 
          value differences, and people tend to know very well what 
          they value, so no wonder they speak with conviction about 
          such issues. Often these value disagreements come down to a 
          bias in favour of solutions that are perceived as 
          benefitting the voter (egoism).
          
          11. Political questions are often so big that to take a 
          stand on them has consequences for ones whole outlook on the 
          world and one's fellow citizens. This makes it difficult for 
          many to adopt a detached, objective approach to political 
          questions; rather many people's political views are choosen 
          so as to harmonise with their personal experiences (and with 
          the political views of the peole around them).
          
          12. Politics might appeal to the same instincts as sport: 
          the feeling of belonging to a group, of combat, we/them, may 
          take priority over a genuine concern to find the right 
          answers.
          
          
          Personally, I think that people with over-confident 
          political opinions deserve a good flogging, for intellectual 
          irresponsibility is the cause of an incalculable amount of 
          suffering and retardation of progress in the world, I 
          believe.

Computer salespeople are rarely programmers!  It is the marketing 
types that make promises such as "We can write software to do X in Y 
months".  The programmers usually hear about this promise afterwards 
and can only roll their eyes and do their best to fullfill the hype.

Perhaps we have a similar situation in the socio-economic policy

create laws or programs to do X in Y months", and the socio-economic 
scientists can only roll their eyes and set out to gather as much data

CLUELESS IN SEATTLE

A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when an 
electrical
malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and
communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could 
not
determine the helicopter's position and course to steer to the airport.
The pilot saw a tall building sticking out above the clouds, flew 
toward
it, circled, drew a handwritten sign, and held it in the helicopter's
window. The pilot's sign said "WHERE AM I?" in large letters.
People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a 
large
sign, and held it in a building window. Their sign said "YOU ARE IN A
HELICOPTER."
The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to 
steer
to SEATAC airport, and landed safely. After they were on the ground, 
the
copilot asked the pilot how the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER" sign helped
determine their position.
The pilot responded "I knew that had to be the MICROSOFT building 
because,
similar to their help-lines, they gave me a technically correct, but
completely useless answer."

Sorry, this just doesn't wash.  People knew damn well what was going on
(well enough to know it was wrong), same as in Germany and Poland where
they had concentration camps next door.  They just rationalised/justified
it, same as people rationalise/justify government. What changed things
was people *declaring* that it was wrong, and declaring that the
rationalisations and justifications were excuses for evil.

It's not that I object to finding ways of making govt. do less damage (I
am a gradualist myself); it's just that I heard no moral condemnation
in your original post.  I think you've got to speak plainly on these
issues: "Look, this government business is evil, we must get rid of it,
but for various reasons we can't do so in one stroke, so here's some
stuff we can do meanwhile to lessen the evil, on the way to stopping it
for good."

It makes more sense to talk that way, I think, than to sort of fall
in with the general line while sneakily trying to subvert it.

Very true. It should be noted that in the Tipler scenario new challenges 
on the physical level does arise an infinite number of times due to the 
Mixmaster oscilliations, while in the Dyson scenario the universe becomes 
"tame" after a certain time. But of course, that doesn't mean the 
challenges for an individual ever ends, as long as the worlds it inhabits 
are changing and developing.

Reinventing The American Dream for the 21st Century:


FIRST NATIONWIDE DELIBERATION DAY WILL ENGAGE 
YOUNG ADULTS IN DISCUSSION ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE 

PHILADELPHIA, February 17 -- In what has been described as the first forum of
its kind, The Foundation for Individual Responsibility and Social Trust
(FIRST) will host the first annual National Deliberation Day (NDD) on and
around April 17, the birthday of Thomas Jefferson.   FIRST is coordinating
local discussions at sites throughout the country wherein young adults, 18-35
years old, will participate in half day discussions designed to develop a new
vision for the American Dream in the next century. 
	"Young adults all too often are branded with the Generation X label,  with
the implication that we are apathetic, have little to contribute, and are not
interested in being involved in the political process," said David Surbeck,
FIRST executive director.  "From the growing interest in National
Deliberation Day from young adults throughout the country, we should be able
to put a stop to those opinions once and for all."   Events are already
planned in cities across the country, including San Francisco, Atlanta,
Austin, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Delware, Lincoln, Nebraska, and South Bend,
Indiana, to name a few.
	While most discussions are scheduled for April 17, some local activities may
take place at other times depending on local circumstances, dates and times
most convenient for local participants.  
	Surbeck noted that every effort is being made to recruit a diverse and
representative group of participants at each location, including a national
outreach effort to complement local activities.  Following National
Deliberation Day, the results will be compiled and a public report issued.
 Further, the results will be integrated into discussion materials for
FIRST's National Issues Convention scheduled for October.
	FIRST received media and public attention when it hosted the country's first
national issues convention for young adults in Philadelphia during National
Constitution Week, September, 1996.   "We The Future...A National Issues
Convention for Young Adults" hosted delegates of every political persuasion
from business, non-profit groups, community groups, unions, and colleges and
universities.  Delegates created a national issues platform for the future
and shared it with Presidential candidates for their comments and responses.
	National Deliberation Day is part of  FIRST's continuing efforts to create
new and meaningful ways for young adults to add their voice to the political
process.  Through National Deliberation Days, yearly issues conventions, the
development  of local chapters, and an education program, FIRST plans to
change the way young adults participate in politics. "Our goal is to provide
opportunities for non-partisan deliberation so that voice of young people is
heard above the din of special interest groups," noted Surbeck.
	The Foundation For Individual Responsibility and Social Trust is a
non-partisan, non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization devoted to making
involvement in the political process meaningful for young adults.
 Headquartered in Philadelphia, FIRST promotes the use of dialogue about the
future of the nation in order to stimulate involvement by young adults in
creating new ways to resolve national issues.

For the same reason we were talking about a few weeks ago; authoritarian
forms of government allow for no opposing views, while libertarian forms
of government allow objectors to set up their own local government of any
kind as long as it's voluntary (or under AC if they have enough power to
coerce people into joining them). So if we set up a Friedman-like society
and it doesn't work we can always try something else.

I like Friedman's conception of anarcho-capitalist institutions, but I'm
primarily interested in reducing the power of governments to give people
the freedom to run their own lives in any voluntary fashion they choose. 
Whether the result is a minimal government such as the US constitution was
intended to provide, a libertarian society or anarcho-capitalism is far
less important. 

This is basically an engineering decision; authoritarian societies give
you many single points of failure which libertarian societies can eliminate. 
If one PPL goes bad, that only affects a small group of people and the 
majority can act to bring it back under control. If a small government 
goes bad then we still have more power than them and can probably defeat 
it. If the massive governments we see today go bad then we're all screwed. 

BTW, can someone help me with an anarcho-capitalism question? I don't
entirely understand how PPL/PPAs operate; I can see that for conflicts
between different PPLs the protection agencies have to go to some kind
of independent court for arbitration, but what happens for disputes
purely between customers of one protection agency? I always assumed that
the agency would settle it themselves, but from rereading 'Machinery of
Freedom' over Christmas Friedman seems to imply that they would still
go to an external court.

Finally, how are PPAs supposed to recognize their customers? Do we all
have to wear big luminous jackets with their logos on or something? I
can see how to do it in a more advanced society (e.g. everyone has
implanted computers and radio-networking), but I'm not sure how we could
do it with current technology.

I would guess that some PPAs would offer the situation you originally
thought, and others would offer the one you understand Friedman to
describe. Unless one or the other business decision proved so
successful as to become standard on the market.

Kaiser and AAA both use membership cards. Alcor uses ID bracelets
or necklaces. Why are you imagining that the identifications need
to be blazoned out for all the public to see at a distance? Maybe
if the BATF was providing protective services for its employees,
but I don't see why this would be necessary for peaceful PPAs
interested in turning a profit.

(For non-Californians, Kaiser is a big hospital corporation that
provides medical care mostly to employees of large organizations
in California, and for non-Yanks, AAA is a automobile club that
provides emergency road services to its members. The government
runs neither one, and AAA functions as a "reseller" of government
registration and licensing services in California, with great
success and customer satisfaction. Though the government might as
well be running Kaiser, considering how intensely the gaze of the
Central Scrutinizer falls upon it.)

Actually, I have no confidence at all that it would "function" or
which one would be "best" (by my standards, which I /do/ have a
clear idea of :).

But since no existing system of government "functions", and no
system in history ever has, what is there to lose but the tyranny
we know so well?  Since there is no direct evidence of a functioning
government, we have no recourse but reason from axiomatic values
to determine a system that best fits them, and work toward that.
When we have that working, and we can see its flaws that we might
not have anticipated, we can fix them as well.

It's not that I have confidence in anarcho-capitalism; it's just
that I have utter contempt for everything else so far proposed.

Your contract with the agency should specify that.  If they want to
use their own court facilities, they certainly can, but it probably
makes more sense to use the same independent courts that resolve
inter-agency disputes to resolve intra-agency ones as well, simply
because they are already equipped for it an experienced at it.  Also,
it separates the interests of the enforcer and the arbitrator, which
is probably a good thing.

Only a criminal needs to know that.  So long as you follow the rules of
your own agency, it has to protect you.  If there were some oddball group
who wanted to prosecute people who said some word to them, your agency
would negotiate with theirs either to exempt its members, add that rule
for its members, or some compromise.  In any case, that would become part
or your agency's rules, and they would spell out what rules you had to
follow to make their job of protecting you easier (or else charge you
more to amortize the chance of your accidental violations).

why then worry about the future ?

why then make plans for the future ?

why then contribute other than to buy and to provide ?

The free market doesn't solve anything.  Lots of people working on
problems for fun and profit solve things.  Think of it as a messy
parallel computer, like the proposals to use Java and the Web as a
fly-by-click supercomputer; or as a massive anthill.  Each node and ant
still should be doing work.  The motivation to do work is the profit

I'm feeling far more anarchist since reading Friedman essays last
night.  Assuming all of his analysis is correct, the missing link of
such advanced economics and game theory seems to be why gov'ts exist, if
they're so nasty.  I have two ideas for possible proofs; one is that
gov't is necessary for at least one function, such as group defense, and
once the mechanism is established it spreads via public good problems.
(Well, I doubt anything happened that particular way.  But it shows why

for any reason you want, say as an outgrowth of tribalism, and escaping
is a very hard public good/Schelling point problem.

In case people are confused, my ideas have for years been a
superposition of wanting to be an anarchist and doubting its
feasibility.  So when I argue with an anarchist, I back minarchy, and
when I argue with any statist, I back anarchy.

You and I /are/ the future.  The free market is just one tool
we will use to make it.  If you want to "contribute" with
self-sacrifice, I won't stop you.  But that zero-sum way of
looking at life--that I cannot benefit others except at my
expense--causes stagnation.  The future is created when bold
individuals create new things for their own benefit, and by
voluntary trade benefit others as well.

Many people say that a child reaches maturity when he first
thinks of the welfare of others.  I have no doubt that this is
an important step, because those others form the world in which
he will live the rest of his life.  But there's an important
further step that they miss: the first contract.  The first time
one willingly obligates oneself to another for the benefit of
both.  That is the act that creates the future.  Sharing a toy
with your sister is fine, but trading one of your old ones for
one of hers to produce a new toy for both, or agreeing to pool
your allowances to buy an expensive toy and schedule its use by
agreement, those are the acts that create a better future for
everyone.

We're all idealists, we just have different ideals.  I see
nothing more fundamentally moral, responsible, life-affirming--
indeed beautiful-- than the act of trade.  No motive more noble
than profit.  No measure of value better than the dollar.  You
still seem to have some emotional attachment to selfless
altruism.  I can't answer your emotional needs, you'll have to
do that for yourself.  If there's ever anything I /can/ do for
you, just offer me a fair price.

Some time ago someone mentioned Jefferson's belief that each generation
should remake its constitution and laws; Greg Burch replied that there's
a lot of wisdom encoded in parts of the law, and it would be inefficient
to recreate that over and over.

But we don't have to.  People can read the old laws and re-enact the
good ones.  The point is to force a reconsideration of the old
structures, and in modern terms get around the public good problem
(people won't organize to get rid of a bad law that hurts them          
slightly).  Think of it as a forest fire: the useless brush and dying
trees are consumed, the healthy live.  Similarly the laws with strong
justifications would be re-enacted; dross would be pruned.

And I've been playing through dialogues on anarcho-capitalism in my head
and re-realizing that taken literally, the US Constitution isn't that
terrible a document, if anarchists were forced to acknowledge the
necessity (one way or another) of some government and were concerned
with limiting its spread.  And I figure that chance of disgoverning the
US without a catastrophe, even if it was a provably good thing, to be
quite small.  So a fair midpoint might be to pass an amendment with
language like "one year from today, all laws enacted prior to today will
be null and void."  (The overlap is to allow continuity between
re-enactments, although testing the effects of a gap in the law could be
interesting.)  It would also provide for the re-occurence of this sweep
on some 10, 20, or 30 year cycle.  It should also include term limits
for legislators, now easily justifiable as it makes no sense to get rid
of laws if the exact same people who passed them originally are still in
office.  A bumper sticker could be "Term limits for laws, not just
Congressmen!".

It could also serve as a benign partial test of libertarian ideas.  If
we're right, and if there were a substantial debate over the laws, then
many should be left dead.  If the post-purge state looks unchanged, then
either flaws in our arguments will have been found, or we'll know the
populace is hopeless and we should run away somewhere.

> ...if anarchists were forced to acknowledge the necessity (one way

I think the terms "anarchy" and "anarchocapitalism" do a disservice
to the cause by emphasizing what isn't really the point.  No A-C wants
the complete lack of those things we now call government; indeed, an
A-C society would operate day-to-day pretty much as a young republic
would.  The point is monopoly by force: we don't oppose government
per se, just forcible monopoly government.  We want government to be
competitive and voluntary.

How about a better term: "agoriarchy"?  Rule by the free market.  This
emphasizes not the absence of rules, but the moral justification for
those rules--voluntary agreement.  It's interesting that your sentence
above explicitly uses the word "forced"; necessity is its own argument,
and needs no advocates.  If something is truly necessary, belief or
disbelief won't change that.  What I find particularly puzzling is the
firmly-held mystical belief that there is something magical--some inner
"governmentness"--that makes a forced monopoly better at providing
certain services than the marketplace.  What is a government but an
organization that provides a product (defense of rights), and why
should that organization not operate like any other in the marketplace?

I like the flavor of that idea as a step in the right direction.  You
might even be able to pass a more limited version.  Say, "all laws
expire 30 years after they are first passed, and must be explicitly
renewed to continue".  That's less like a forest fire and more like
thinning the old from the population.

My ideals tend to be a bit more long term [and perhaps more optimistic
in the extreme] than others being they often require a great deal of
enabling technology. In this case I
can imagine a time where  nanotechnology will eventually [perhaps a well
protracted eventually] make money obsolete. In the
distant future it is likely that via things such as self-replicating,
self-modifying, nano-objects, we will be able to create and
dismantle whatever we require in real time. No money needed. Once you
have a handful of these things, they will very rapidly
create more of themselves by rearranging atoms very prevalent atoms.
This of course is beyond what nanotechnology promises today,
yet very likely in some distant future when our knowledge and technology
has developed sufficiently.

The single greatest motive for corruption is profit. Thats not
particularly noble to me. Social Security was a great idea ... until
some guy found a loop hole in the system and said, "Hey, you know what,
we can borrow money from Social Security and
promise to pay it back, but the catch is we never will. Free money!" 
    Currently money is *almost* neccessary to survive, and certainly
neccessary to partake in society. This will not *always* be
the case. Even now if one so desired they could choose to live off the
land, growing their own food, etcetera. This is very
possible in principle, but our government makes it financially
impossible. We have to pay taxes on our land or else have it
confiscated. Thus the law does not allow you to become wholly autonomous
and self-sufficient in the United States. You have
to earn a living in order to pay the taxes for the land you live on. I
strongly believe that if some hippy nature freak wants to
drop out of the system he or she should be able to do so. This would
only require the removal of one tax, property tax, or at
least the part of property tax which includes land.

Tesla was working towards free energy for the masses, but then monetary
interests such as Eddison and the US government
quickly ended that noise. 
  
Right now the average price for internet access is probably about $20 in
the US. Everyone online has equal access to the
majority of the information, but it seems that once the technology is in
place that everyone want to make it cost per/byte or
per/page or what have you to access information. This will once again
limit the amount of information the poor can access
while the charge won't even noticably affect the wealthy. My site will
remain free. If some how that makes me altruistic or a
socialist then so be it. That is one of the greatest things I enjoy
about the internet as it is now. Free info for all. Why make it
cost when we don't have to? Its because people like yourself  believe
there is "No motive more noble than profit". I strongly
disagree. I find offering free information a hell of a lot more noble. 
  
There is a fella by the name of Michael Hart who hopes to have10,000
books online by the year 2002. Access will be free to
them all. This is the kind of guy I admire. Not the owners of
Amazon.com.

Books would be a hell of a lot cheaper if we would legalize marijuana
and use it for paper instead. Its the fastest growing
bio-mass in the world. Very inexpensive to produce. It generally lasts a
great deal longer than the paper we use today also. 
  
2% of our nation has 50% of the money. Money does not flow as freely as
people often imagine. It is not easy to rise out of
poverty. By defining minimum wage our puppet government is allowed to
define just how many people will live in poverty,
spending their lives enslaved to the system working 60-80 hour work
weeks. I know many people who work these hours and
are still barely able to make ends meet. Employment is modern slavery.
We give our slaves just enough to survive, make them
work long hours so they don't have time to question the system, and keep
them numb and entertained via the television, our
modern opiate of the masses. I think it will be a long time before
people recognize employment as slavery, but they will, and
then people will be working towards what will be neccessary to abolish
it. It is certainly a long term goal and sounds ludicrous
to 99% of the people I mention it to. "I like my job. I like my boss. My
job is neccessary for survival." Yep, a lot of the slaves
liked their jobs and masters also. It was neccessary for those slaves to
remain slaves in order to survive. It was a small minority
of slaves which actually attempted to escape the system. 
  
What are there, like 6 billion people in the world, and about 40 million
who have internet access. That means that less than 1%
(about 0.6%) of our world population has internet access. The biggest
hindering factors being economic, and then political.

kids would really like one but he can't afford it. He's lucky to keep
food on the table. I tried to express to him that if his kids
grew up computer illiterate that they might very well find themselves in
the same position that he is now. And then I went on to
explain how the internet could help them in regards to school (his boy
paged him for help on some homework while he was
here), but none the less, he is a hard working individual who cannot
really afford it.  Food and rent are more important;
Survival. 
  
To sum up. Profit is not the most noble motive. It is the most likely
motive to corrupt, particularly in the case of government
officials. Some things cost a hell of a lot more than they should. Some
things cost money now, and some things will soon cost
money that do not need to, e.g., access to web pages. And someday,
though probably long after I am dead, money won't
even be an issue.  
  
Once we realize that money will not always be neccessary, we can then
start moving towards it. Capitalism is great. I love the
fact that I get to choose from 20 different stereo brands, but there are
things we can do to refine the system so that we are not
required to exploit and hinder so many people. Think about all the
people working for a dollar a week [perhaps exagerated,
perhaps not] in third world countries just to produce the clothing you
are wearing. Is it really a matter of laziness. No. They do
not have the opportunity to rise above their condition. The same is true
of many people in the United States. 
  
Most of the people on this list seem to be in favor of private
education. Yes it is certainly better than public education. My
fiance went to a private school from first to twelth grade. It cost
about $9000 a year. Some students are accepted into
Harvard from her school while they are only juniors. Almost all get into
some Ivy League school or another. But who the hell is
going to be able to pay that kind of money for an education? A very
small minority. We just happen to live in third most
wealthy county in the United States. If we kill public education, the
majority of kids are going to be stuck in severely poor
private schools, much poorer than they would be with government
financing. And even if you argue that it is the parents fault
that they have no money, it is certainly not the fault of the child. Why
should that kid be forced to have a petty education? I'm certainly not a
big fan of government intervention, but if we are going to move towards
private education we need to make sure that everyone is going to get at
least some minimally satisfactory level of education. You may think the
government does not achieve this now, but it would be much worse without
government financing, if all the money had to come from the
neighborhoods the schools were located in. There are a lot of really
poor neighborhoods out there.
  
Not all poor people are lazy and unambitious! Its the system that is
messed up. Not the people. What kills me is poor
Republicans, poor people that have been brain washed into thinking they
are going to be rich, and thus they should embrace
the political system with the greatest bias towards the rich. And thus
they stab themselves in the foot, creating fewer
opportunities for themselves to ever attain any wealth.

Absolutely.  I had a heart-warming experience today, when a woman's little
boy was run down outside the cafe where she was drinking her morning coffee.
As his blood ran into the gutter and he screamed for her help, she called
crisply to him, `What's it worth, Billy?  Half your allowance?'  It was hard
to hear his bid because his throat was a mess, but I think they settled on
two dollars.

Not for a minute.  Please don't drop the context of the discussion; I
made no mention at all of /why/ I value life, only the principle with
which to interact with others consequent to valuing life.  Life is valued
because of all those wonderful things you mention--that are no less
precious to me than to you.  Breathtaking beauty, romantic love, sensuous
delights, intellectual challenge, humor, friendship--those are the things
that make life worth living--that give it value.  Because it has value, 
and because peaceful coexistence with others who have those values is also
valuable to me, I act to obtain those values peaceably and honestly.  Free
trade is a /consequence/ of the value of life, not what makes it valuable.

You are making a category error to compare trade with "other things" in
life.  It is not competing with those "other" things; it is not in the
same category.  Trade is a principle of human interaction, not a value
in itself.  You can't compare them on the same scale any more than one
can compare weight and length with "benevolence".  It's like I was
discussing what kind of music I like, and someone says "Yeah, Bach is
OK, but what about Fettucine Alfredo?" 

Now since obtaining those things generally means interacting with others
(because some involve others, and some we just can't each make ourselves),
it follows that trade will be involved in most aspects of one's day-
to-day life.  We're not hunter gatherers anymore.  Most societies  in the
present era have moved from hunter-gatherer to slave/exploiter.  Hopefully
we can progress further to free traders.  Perhaps in some long-distant
future in a different technological world, something even better might
be possible (say, immortal non-consuming explorers), but not yet.

enough has been said about emotions, creativity and development already so
i'll stick to the ethical/political part.

or the fun. My posting was a very general reply to some of the threads of
the last few days, as well as a sort of continuation of some of the things
brought up by Jim legg. 

Lim Legg had a serious point to make, but maybe his approach was too
fundametalist socialist, and the true meaning of his words didn't come
through: once you have reached a point where your income (production for
profit reasons) is steadily growing, and you can control your spending
pattern, then what is the use of making more money just for the sake of
spending more. True freedom and happiness can be found in more things than
just being able to BUY whjatever you like. It also has to do with being
able to DO everything you like, sure money buys you time, but i get the
feeling that some people here view spending time on non profit intended
production or consumption as a waste of resources. 

Anton sherwood wrote:

What about problems where no market solution fits ? And still if a majority
views something as a problem, and a minority views it as a good thing, the
free market will rule against it ? A characteristic we oppose in the
current forms of democracy. Except that in this case a minority with more
money can decide for a majority with fewer money... 
 
Lee Daniel Crocker wrote:
>If you want to "contribute" with self-sacrifice, I won't stop you.  
& zero sum etc...

I don't believe in zero sum, i do believe in a free market system, and in
added value through production, and i'd go even further than that by saying
that my life philosophy is that an increase in population will bring an
increase in value to society, seeing that human resources are the greatest
possible resource this planet has to offer.

I however see where some 'problems' can be too big for a free market,
individually based system. I see a need for a big institution (not
necessarily a state) to supply education, maybe even invest in individuals,
for profit reasons. I  believe in the power of a totally free market
system, i just see problems in the human element of implementing it. The
most important one being that humans don't see things long term (due to
their limited life span)   

Investing for Profit principle & long term future planning.  

Wether people organise in companies or social states, they create an
institution that has a goal the long term increase in productivity and
benefit (profit) of the company/society. problem is that in a democracy the
individuals who decide over the destiny of the rest, have as main goal
their own re-election. Just as the director of a company, who decides over
the destiny of everybody in that company has as main goal his own personal
position, he also runs the risk of being fired by the share holders. This
puts great emphasis on temporary measures and policies, focussed on short
term interest. the more powerful such an institution becomes the more long
term focussed it's policies will become. Kind of conflicts with the anarchy
part of it all doesn't it ?  
    
I can't help but notice a great many conflicting views coming from the same
individuals on this list. Especially when it comes to long term future
planning. I think it was Eric who pointed out a protection system against
asteroids, how do you see a free market system taking care of problems of
this scope ? No company in its right mind will invest in such a system, as
it is impossible to give protection from asteroid collisions to only those
who pay for that protection. Its the school book example of how the ducth
state is justified: who else would build a dike to protect us from the sea ?  

It might work in the Roman way of bread and circusses, as a gift from some
ultra rich individual or company to placate the angry mobs. But its hyper
irrational to depend on chance.

>I see nothing more fundamentally moral, responsible,
life->affirming--indeed beautiful-- than the act of trade. 

True. The act of trade is beautiful as it makes all involved parties happy
and brings them benefit.  


>No motive more noble than profit.

untrue. 

purely rational explanation: 

1) when that profit is not re-inserted into society by spending/consuming. 

2) profit can be made by ways that undermine the free market system.
monopoly positions, patents, etc...

therefore: free market system highest value: yes
profit highest value: no

>You still seem to have some emotional attachment to selfless
>altruism.  

no, you mistake my ethical and rational views for emotional ones.

If an individual dies of poverty, all that he could have contributed to
society (and therefore to me personally) will have been lost. Given some
investment this person could have been thought and given the means to
provide for himself, society and the institution (company or state) reaping
the benefits of that investment. problem is no current company is big
enough to be interested in investtemst of such a scope. And if one ever
exists, then will we not be subject to it in similar ways as we are to a
state today ?

I'm still in doubt wether to support a completely free society, as i see
the benefits to economy and individual freedom of a smaller state or no
state. But i'm also convinced of the increased benefits and possibilities
of the largest possible scale of coordinated efforts of individuals. My
quest is to merge those into a workable system, as i feel that without such
a coordination of efforts, the economy and humanity are headed for a
repetition of the dark ages. 

The anthill example with regards to the free market system is therefore
based completely on the ancient humanist and liberal assumption that
everyone will know exactly what to do an will instinctively do what is best
for him/herself. I think you'll find that every ant follows orders to an
extent, just like computers are told what to do by their program, a
compromise between individual decisions and 'orders'. I'm now (very
cautiously) toying with the idea of a system like this, which could be
translated and justified to a human level by giving individuals the level
of self-ownership they have proven to be capable of by acting responsably.
Question remains who or what should decide in these matters ?

Think about it, what place do mentally disordered people have in an anarcho
capitalist society ? They can't provide for themselves, and i don't believe
in peoples altruism (at least not anymore). Viewed purely rationally, a
coordinated system could turn even their limited capablilties into a
productive and profitable resource, making them too able to provide for
themselves. An uncoordinated society is throwing away resources by the
truckloads. Again the emotional side of things left completely aside.      

>If there's ever anything I /can/ do for you, just offer me a fair >price.

Here's where ethics come in. Would you do everything given the price is
high enough ? Would you kill a person if i offered you enough ? Would you
prostitute yourself ? (not that i'm interested ;-) ) Would you willingly
hurt other people for a price ?

Everybody has different ethical values on what they would do for a price. A
hitman, a thief, a child porn distributor, are all supplying to a demand.
They value profit over their ethical views on the subject. Something which
this society has condemned as being criminal, would you brand people who
oppose these acts as fundamentalists ?. There are people who want to die,
there are people who want to get their things stolen (to claim from
insurance companies) and there are kids who will gladly prostitute
themselves for money. All these acts are therefore not *by definition*
violating other individuals freedom. Yet in most cases they are.   

Most people value something higher than profit, im truly sorry for you if
you don't.

 Suppose there was a widespread preference for candidates who promise
randomness, and that such promises were often enforceable. Would that
give candidates an incentive to make such promises? It isn't obvious
that the benefits of winning an election after making such a promise
exceed the costs of getting elected.

 Given the frequency with which candidates break promises ("Read my
lips ...", "I won't seek a second term", etc.), why would voters
expect they could enforce a promise of randomness?

 The rational agents in their minds could be aware that the information
value is negligible, but unable to prevent the advertisers from
exploiting evolutionary quirks in other parts of the mind.

Yes. Both Damien and Nadia's responses seem to assume that trade is 
only about material objects and that human emotions are somehow not 
subject to the principles of communication and economics that are 
nicely summarized by the single word 'trade'.

Of course, when you make statements like
<No measure of value better than the dollar.>

which allowed Gregory to ask
<What is the monetary value of your love for your mother?>

and Damien to post his sarcastic scenario which I won't repeat.

Of course there are some things we value where it is not practical to 
put a _monetary_ value on them, particularly in life-threatening 
situations.  But this does not mean that the principles of trade don't 
still apply in most situations where there is time for reasoned 
thought rather than immediate reflex reaction.

Yes again.  I think people like Gregory (and Jim Legg, who 
coincidentally departed just before Gregory appeared) seem to think 
that it's already feasible for us to be "immortal non-consuming 
explorers", just because that is what most transhumanists and 
extropians desire, just because some of us are already living in an 
'information age', even though the majority are still stuck in the 
agricultural or industrial ages.  I don't believe in sudden 
transcendance - no human or AI or SI can suddenly *absorb* all the

*access* to it.  If, as you say, we are not first "free traders", then 
we are regressing to a "slave/exploiter" mode.  Both self and societal

notes from my archives might also add some value here:

<06/23/93. COMPULSORY ETHICS. Letters to the Wall Street Journal 
regarding Michael Lerner's 6/3 Counterpoint article "The Meaning of 
the Politics of Meaning" are unanimously negative. As John W. Deming, 
Jr. of Palo Alto, Calif., writes: "The activist government of Mr. 
Lerner's (and Hillary Clinton's) 'politics of meaning' means 
increasing state intrusiveness into our lives at the expense of our 
own voluntary pursuits of happiness. Such noncoercive pursuits are 
what make up the marketplace, a natural human phenomenon that Mr. 
Lerner scorns. It's interesting that he considers peaceful commercial 
activity as evil while he views state coercion as the font of goodness 
and light. In fact, his views and incidentally Mrs. Clinton's also, 
betray an appalling ignorance of how markets actually function. The 
free market is the world's most vivid example of the Golden Rule. 
Since the marketplace arises from noncoercive exchange, the only way 
to succeed in a market environment is to create value for others." Dan 
Lyons of Wheaton, Ill., adds: "Mr. Lerner refers to our capitalistic 
process as 'an economy whose bottom line metality rewards those who 
are most effective at manipulating or controlling others ...' In a 
truly free market no one controls or manipulates anyone. A deal is 
consummated only if all involved parties mutually benefit from the 
transaction. The only institution that unduly controls us is the 
activist government that Mr. Lerner purports to be associated with.">

One of the things I like best about this group is how bright the folks are
who are attracted to extropianism and who participate on this list.  This
often exhibits itself in a "convergent evolution" of memes, with people
figurng out the same truths from different angles.  Damien's "forest fire"
suggestion is a perfect example of this.  The idea of a defined end to the
efficacy of a law or other government function, forcing the reconsideration
of its value, is actually known in at least the theory of legislation, but
unfortunately not very common in practice.  It is called "sunset", in a
metaphor that really doesn't convey the worth of the idea as well as
Damien's.

I am by no means an expert on this subject, but do recall that the idea of
"sunset" features in legislation became fashionable in the late 70s and know
that at least some governmental agencies and functions have had sunset
provisions written into their enabling legislation since then.  (I have a dim
recollection that it may have been a minor buzzword in the policy lexicon of
the Carter administration and know that it gets mentioned from time to time
in the Texas legislature.)  But I can't think of any fundamental legislation
(like codes governing basic commercial or social relations) or big or
expensive governmental agencies that have serious sunset deadlines.  

Furthermore, I can't think of any correlary of the sunset principle in any
common law system of which I am aware.  Thus, for instance, in the common law
regimes with which I am familiar, a principle of law is just that until it is
affirmatively challenged and a conscious decision is made to change it.  In
fact, the idea of a definite "lifespan" for a specific rule of law is quite
foreign to the fundamentally ad-hoc and case-specific process of developing
legal principles in the common law process.  Thus Damien's suggestion of a
constitutional sunset or "forest fire" amendment would in fact be necessary,
as a matter of legal theory and practice in our current system.

>  [snip Damien's specific proposal for a "forest fire" constitutional
amendment.

I think my criticism of the re-writing of all laws applies here: The cost of
the disruption caused by the uncertainty of future legal principles that
would come from repealing ALL legislation at once would likely outweigh the
benefits from weeding out obsolete rules and regulations.  The intricate web
of commercial and social relationships that make up life in society is
premised in large part on a precitability of results from the legal system
(even if those results are only NOTIONAL, i.e. the rules of decision in
disputes aren't actually invoked in real disputes -- because the parties know
the likely outcome of disputes).  This observation by no means undermines the
great value of Damien's insight.  Adoption of sunset or forest fire
principles as a fundamental feature of legislative and common law legal
regimes, with gradual application across all rules of law, is a very, very
good idea.  I just think a gradualist implementation would be more likely to
capture the net benefits of such a legal tool.

You're saying that people who exactly what slavery was like, they just
didn't realize it was "immoral"?  I find this hard to fathom.   I
instead see two major changes from the past:
1)  People were getting richer, and richer folks can better afford to
indulge their "moral" feelings. 
2)  U.S. slave were unusual in history: the slave population grew locally.
In contrast, most slaves were spoils of war/domination imported from
elsewhere, and who didn't reproduce very well locally.  Its lots
easier to be cruel to foreigners than to locals.

I think the biggest problem this this re tax evasion is that most
people find it hard to imagine a functioning society with government
taxes.  In contrast, abolitionists could easily imagine socities
without slaves.  To the extent you can point to places that function
without restrictive drug laws, you may have better luck there.

in addition to my reply yesterday, i would like to add the following (still
not having read friedman, getting that asap)

a free market system relies heavily on chance: the chance that problems in
society will be tackled by making them profitable. 

a chance which in my opinion offers no guarantees, as the profit principle
will result in individuals and companies not directing their efforts to
simply activities that are profitable, but instead will focus mainly on
those that are THE MOST PROFITABLE.

please before replying to this, read my last reply to see the context in

Both of those seem plausible, but I still think the most fundamental
underlying change is moral belief itself.  People believe all kinds of
crazy things; why is it so hard to accept that they believed any of a
number of justifications for the common practice of slavery: racial
inferiority, economic necessity, right of conquest.  It is part of our
mental machinery to de-sensitize ourselves to everyday things.

Let's take an example from modern times: circumcision.  Objectively,
it is absolutely no different from female genital mutilation as
practiced in Muslim nations.  It has no medical basis (though you
will hear many doctors give post-hoc justifications for it that have
more evasive maneuvers than a submarine), it is provably painful to
the infant (and many still ignore that fact and claim otherwise).
In short, it is useless, barbaric, cruel, ... and commonplace.  I'm
not saying that moels and OBs are heartless machines; most are likely
very compassionate people.  But they were brought up with certain
mystical beliefs, and never challenged them with proper reasoning.
But the moel knows what is involved--he sees the blood, he hears the
cries, he has just used belief to immunize his mind from the facts.
He simply does not "know" that it is immoral, because he has failed
to ask the question and rationally pursue the answer.

I'm not sure the benefit would work at this scale.  Between limited
choice of your representative, and _one_ random person from your
district, I'm not sure which is the rational choice.  Statistics work
best on a large scale.

I've looked over all the posts on this topic, and I don't have time to
respond to each one in detail.  But overall I don't buy these theories:

HIGH STAKES -- Maybe the max/min possible outcomes are extreme, but
the expected stakes aren't out of line with other areas where people
act much less confident.

NOT VERIFIABLE -- There may be differences in fields in the ease of
verifying claims, but politics is comparable with many other areas
where people act much less confident: software/features you need for
your computer, how to drive safely, psychotherapy, preventing cancer.
Many of these areas have pretty high stakes, and poor ability to
verify expert claims, yet people admit their ignorance and defer to
others often.

CONFIDENCE PERSUADES -- Yes, confidence can help persuade sometimes.
But it can also make you look really stupid other times, and the issue
here it to explain a differnce: Why *more* confidence in politics.

These theories I consider sorta plausible:

SPECIFIC IGNORNANCE -- A standard "left" view is that politics is
mostly about values, and that a standard "right" view is that most
people are pretty stupid.  These two views are wrong, but we can sorta
understand how people who hold them might be very condident and slow
to realize their error.  But political confidence has been around for
quite some time; can people really be that slow?

SOCIAL SPORT -- We're in a signaling game where political knowledge is
taken as a sign of  intelligence and social connectedness.  So  we try
to appear  knowledgeable, even if  this knowledge isn't otherwise very
useful.  Hence the focus on persuasion over self-use, which encourages
confidence.   Group leaders who  might  be in  a position to influence
what  sort of knowledge is  used in  this signaling game believe it is
good for their groups to use politics;  it helps your  interest  group
get  more  benefits  vs.  other groups, and they  suppose  "democratic
participation is good for democracy".

A related idea is that people are trying to signal their membership in
particular social groups distinguished by political "beliefs" (really
verbal banners).  Typically, signaling that you are between two groups
isn't such a good strategy.

Some specific comments:

This would argue for a differential confidence among political issues,
but not for a difference between politics and say psychotherapy.

Yes, there is this similarity.  So the puzzle is the difference:  Most
people easily admit they don't know what computer stuff to buy, and
they take lots of advice from computer salesfolks.

It's not obvious to me.  There are lots of small elections that don't
cost that much to enter.  Maybe you'd need an expensive ad campaign to
make clear your position the first time someone like this ran, but
after the first few all you need to say is "random party", and
everyone should know exactly what you mean.  No need for finer policy
statements.

How about posting a bond that you lose if you break your promise?
Compared to most political promises, this should be relatively easy to
verify that it was broken.

I do think it is possible that overcoming these two barriers is a cost
that it happens that no group has been willing to try yet, and recent
changes of opinion will soon make it feasible to overcome.  That is,
it could be that this idea is just now ripe for implementation.  But
we should consider other theories as well.

This is possible, but they why should these rational parts have any
more luck convincing their bodies to endorse a random legislature,
etc?  In general, I think it is too easy to make up irrationality
theories; a equally simple rationality theory gets more weight for me.
And there are such theories for advertizing.

Yes, but the key to this statement lies in your wording:  "SEEM to assume" -
but that is not what i assume. Trade *in itself* is a wonderful manifestation
of a fair and equitable mind. It is rational. It allows for much pleasure and
gain. Even more importantly, it is a great starting point for fixing and
maintaining a boundary against altruism and selflessness in a society where
self and individuality is sorely misvalued.

I think communication and economy are but two of myriad activities we will
engage in over our lifetimes... our long, long, lifetimes....

That may have been a moment of rhetorical vagueness on my part.  I think 
my words were "no /measure/ of value better than the dollar, no act more
fundamentally moral than trade.  Either way, it was a bit more poetic
than rigorous, and I can understand why it might be misinterpreted.

What do people think about the way the industrialized, non-communist world
has been heading towards gradual socialization ever since Marx?  Extropy
appears to have a faith in evolution and boundless expansion-a constant
increase in extropy created by life wading upstream against the
"inevitable" heat death of the universe due to the laws of thermodynamics.
Why, then, do we see the flourishing of socialism?  Is it simply due to
the entropic influence of socialistic idealists?  If I were to accept this
answer, one would have to tell me why it is that Japan, being one of the
more socialistic of the industrialized nations, is so extropic- by this I
mean they are way ahead of the rest of the world in longevity(mostly
because their cuisine is naturally high nutrient/low calorie) and they
produce new technology at a rate much higher than the rest of the world.
It seems that if the technological singularity spawns from one point, it
will be Japan.  Also,  the country I am from, Canada, is very socialistic
and also very technologically-oriented(which is not what some
"brazil-of-the-north" environmental alarmists might have you believe,
suggesting that Canada is a wood-harvesting-based economy)
Canadians are in general optimistic about technology, interested in
longevity, and positive about the future, yet this is combined with a
strong feeling that government and social agencies play an important role
in the future, and I don't think many believe volunteer  organizations are
ready to take over the function of these institutions.  It seems to me
that the most competent workers and minds in our society are not
volunteers- society tends to condition talented people to use their
talents to make money, rather than to volunteer for the benefit of
humankind.  Although I agree with the other principles of extropianism, I
am not wholly convinced that people will volunteer enough to maintain the
social programs such as secondary and post-secondary education that we
enjoy today.  This seems to me like a similar assumption to that of Karl
Marx, that people are just going to "do their part" because they are so
glad to be in the idyllic society that they are in .  For Marx, it was an
idyllic society of equality, for extropianism, it is an idyllic society of
freedom.

        Sorry to bring back an old ghost, but I fear it has not yet been
quelled on this list.  This post is about the mentality of gender
differentiation (or the lack thereof) and the multitudes of gender related
taboos.  I believe that it is an extropian topic in that it deals with
various aspects of human thought...something that is detrimental to a
posthuman existance.

        One can take all the feminist and misogynist movements (give or take
a few short lived movements in particular) and roll them into two seperate
piles: domination or equality.  A common feminist argument I hear is one of
female persecution through the centuries.  It is true.  Until Mary Shelley
and Emily Dickinson came around in the nineteenth century, there had been
virtually no female notability (I'm excluding "nobility") since Joan of Arc,
and prior to her, Sappho.  It is quite unfortunate that women were shunned
for so many centuries --I'm sure that there were just as many potentially
powerful women as there were kinetically powerful men;
but for *some* reason, women were not encouraged to be great...they were not
taught that they were equal to men in mental ability.  Instead, women were
taught to be 'perfect little housewives' and convinced that they were doing
*men* a service by bearing children.  Perhaps this was partially due
to the devotionary diatribe of the Bible --which stated that men are
dominant-- though the true answer will probably never be found.

        This is a compelling argument for feminists, and a very true one
*but* I seriously wonder how this affects the present.  Sure, the past has
been male-dominated, but what is the current aim of feminism?  Do feminist
movements want females to dominate males to make up for the past antithesis
between the genders?  Or do feminist movements want to bring the whole
concept of "gender" up to a plateau?  Is there a desire for domination or
equality?  I, of course, prefer the latter.  I find domination to be
entropic, to say the least.  Mankind can learn from the
past and use it to extrope toward the future.

        Currently, there seems to be a gender imbalance; this "imbalance" is
more mental than physical.  The idea of 'women's rights' is the same as
saying 'people with red moustaches' rights': it boils down to an ideal of
the elevation of one portion of mankind over another.  Why should there be
women's rights?  What gives women an advantage over men?  Why should there
be male rights?  What gives men an advantage over women?  Why should there
be gay rights?  What gives gays an advantage over non-gays?  To me, it
simply does not make sense.  To me, the concept of "rights" is an irrational
belief that one person has power over another, and that inevitably *causes*
sexism, racism and people-with-red-moustachism rather
than illeviating it.  It invokes the other "non-rights" group(s) to gain an
advantage over the "rights" group(s).  *That* is what creates an imbalance.

        I cannot understand a need for a moral imbalance of any sort.  I
open my eyes and see *people* thinking and *people* acting, not particularly
*women* or *men* doing such.  Just as I conveyed in the "Genius" thread
about a month ago, there are *no* boundaries except those which we
create...either as mankind or as individuals.  If someone wishes to become
something, that one generally can do so if he or she has strong enough of a
will to kineticize his potential.  There is no rift between the sexes, just
as there is no rift between the races.  We create rifts
by saying that there *are* rifts because there aren't.  Women think the same
way that men do (generally); one race thinks the same way as another race
(generally).  I don't see the rift.  Why create one?

Some legitimate questions have been raised here that deserve a
more thourough treatment than Rand's dogmatic dismissals and
Friedman's silent avoidance.  In particular, how do we resolve
radical individualist ethics with human compassion and certain
apparently positive aspects of altruism?

Two-person relationships like romantic or filial love can be
treated as mutual agreements, and are pretty easy to fit into 
individualist ethics.  Love is a contract.  Relationships are
a value to both involved, or they are unstable and destructive.
The more interesting question is that of selfless altruism.

First I recognize that there are drives in human nature that
predispose me to certain altruistic practices, whether I rationally
judge them moral or not.  If it were my son in danger, I would
risk considerable danger to myself to rescue him, without question.
But I also know /why/ those drives are there, which has nothing to
do with my rational moral choices: evolution.  Genes that caused
fathers to rescue their sons prospered, because those sons were
the gene's mode of travel to the next generation.  Other altruistic
behaviors not kin-linked can also evolve based on reciprocity.
Birds and apes that groom each other suffer fewer parasites than
those that don't, and so are more successful.  But there are also
evolutionary drives of the same sort that predispose me to kill
my stepchildren and cheat on my wife.  I therefore reject human
nature, as shaped by evolutionary forces we understand pretty well,
as a valid source for moral behavior.

There is a second reason to do so, even with altruistic behavoirs.
That is the fact that evolutionarily stable strategies are rarely
optimal strategies.  The prisoners' dilemma is a classic example.
Even iterated encounters will generally settle into strategies that
are less exploitable, but sub-optimal.

Humans have an advantage over other beings: we can change the rules
of the game.  We can jump outside the system.  With imagination and
free will, we can find other strategies that we weren't born with,
and practice them, and teach them.

Even if I reject human nature as a source of moral guidance, I might
still accept its existence as a fact in determining personal values.
That is, even if I reject basing my actions upon emotional desires,
I might recognize that they make certain things valuable to me, and
I will act rationally to obtain those values.  This offers us no help
in determining what those rational actions might be, so it is still
rather unsatisfying.

There is, I think, a better way to look at certain acts of unilateral
altruism as a positive self-interest, and that is simply to recognize
that interaction with others fills the vast majority of your time on
this planet, and one cannot practically pre-negotiate contracts with
every other human you might meet, it makes sense to create /principles/
of behavior that facilitate everyone's smooth interaction with others.
Non-violence is the most obvious such principle, and a good one.  It
serves to maximize the potential of the use of the mind, by removing
from the equation a major restraint.  A mind under compulsion is not
a mind at all; it cannot reason and choose freely. 

But that alone is not sufficient for positively altruistic behaviors
to arise.  Benevolence can still be rational for several reasons: (1)
since you obtain most of your values by trade with others, assisting a
stranger in some way at a small cost to yourself may benefit you in
the amount of that stranger's potential value to you at a later time.
(2) Even with no direct benefit to you, that stranger may be a value
to others, who will then be of more value to you.  (3) Even if there
were no potential benefit to you personally, the /principle/ of
benevolence benefits you when generally practiced, just like the
principle of non-violence.

Benevolence and non-violence are probably not evolutionarily stable
strategies, in that they are susceptible to exploitation.  But they
are probably optimal strategies, and as humans we can change the rules
of the game--structure society--so that they become standards that
win out by pure numbers, or are held stable by institutions designed
to maintain them.

That still leaves a few situations that might make some individualists
uncomfortable.  For one, what is the value to you of more than small
risk in the service of others, i.e., heroism?  Is a volunteer fire
fighter rationally moral?  For another, why do we judge as immoral or
callous one who simply refrains from a benevolent act, even one of
little risk, when we must assume he is as good a judge of the risks
and rewards to himself as we are?

I must admit that I can find no rational motive for either of these
reactions, despite the fact that I feel them too.  I admire volunteer
firemen, but I cannot judge their actions as rationally moral by the
standards I choose.  I must judge them self-sacrificing altruists,
because fire protection is a service that the market is capable of
prividing for pay, and providing it that way is likely to lead to more
advances of human potential.  I look with scorn at the teenager who
does not give his train seat to an elderly woman; but I can find no
rational justification for this feeling either.  I must simply resort
to feeling the way I feel, and try not to act on that.  It would be
unreasonable to simply assume that it is moral to do so, and then
stretch for a reason--that's creationist reasoning.  I must chalk it
up for now as a quirk of human nature, until I can find some other
rational explanation.

I don't need to place a monetary value on the love I have for my mother 
because I can't sell it to you at any price, even if I wanted to. That 
doesn't mean we place an infinite value on life, we don't, not even on our 
own life. If we did we'd live in the cheapest one room apartment we could 
find and eat nothing but soybeans, powdered milk and vitamin tablets. 
The money saved would be used to pay for more health insurance and for 
emergencies.

The Free market provides an index of civilization's opinion of the value of 
object, and that includes intangibles. Intangibles are important and they are 
reflected in the price. I could make more money if I change jobs and worked 
for a different company, but if it's an unpleasant, unfriendly place then it 
might not be worth it to me. If I was the CEO of that company I'd try to make
the working conditions more pleasant so I wouldn't have to pay so much to get 
people to work for me.

Nothing is free, the only question is if the people who consume a commodity 
will pay for it themselves, or if they will use  force to make other people 
pay it for them.  As for Tesla, he was a great genius but he was also nutty 
as a fruitcake.

It doesn't matter how badly you need the money, if your services are only  
worth 1$ an hour to me then that is all I will pay for them, unless I'm 
engaged in charity. If the government decrees that I must pay everybody 5$ an 
hour then the solution is obvious, I won't hire anybody and now you make 
0$ an hour.

It is not a coincidence that the places on the Earth where Internet access is

        >Food and rent are more important [than the Internet]   
       

If a person can not afford to buy a used computer at a garage sale, then I 
don't understand how they can buy a new color television and I don't  
understand how they can then afford to spend hundreds of hours a month 
watching it.  If they can not pay 20$ a month for Internet access how can 
they afford to spend 10 tines that much on cigarettes and beer? 


        >Survival. 


In western society it has nothing to do with survival, just what luxuries you

I do think about it, and it makes me happy to think that without me these 
dreadfully poor people would be one dollar poorer.
            

        >Is it really a matter of laziness. No. 


I agree. Nearly everybody in third world countries works harder than I do. 
The basic problem is that although there is far more wealth in world than 
there has ever been, regardless of how you divide up the pie there is still 
not enough for 6 billion people to have what you or I would consider an 
acceptable standard of living. We need a bigger pie, and fortunately I think 
we will soon have one.

All theories must be consistent with the facts if they are to be viable,  
let's see if the experimental data supports your theory. In the poorest slums  
Socialism provides the schools, in those same slums Capitalism provides the  
cars.  I ask you, which are more numerous in those slums, good cars or good
schools?              

Some say Anarchy won't work because it can't produce "a public good" like a 
dam. A public good is something beneficial, that because of it's nature, 
must be provided to the entire public or it can't be provided at all. 
Well, a true public good is almost impossible to achieve under any system, 
and yes, constructing a large dam, especially one that didn't make economic 
sense (or cents), would be more difficult under Anarchy than a dictatorship, 
but it's not clear how many more large dams we need. What is very clear is 
that we need more justice, unfortunately a good law is also a public good, 
and that is exactly why good laws are as rare as hen's teeth when government
makes the laws.   

I don't think there should be equal justice for all, then justice becomes a 
public good and thus nobody gets much of it. Just like everything else, 
if you want to maximize something, make it a commodity and sell it on the 
free market. A good car is not a public good, it is a private good, even if 
everybody doesn't have one, even if I am the only one on earth who has one, 
it's still a good car. The way society is currently set up, private law is 
not allowed so a good law is always a public good, everybody must obey 
exactly the same good law. That's why there are so many more good cars than 
good laws. This also explains why governments don't legislate themselves   
out of existence, doing so would be a public good.              

A public school system that could really educate people would be a public 
good, so would an efficient department of motor vehicles. We don't have 
either and for the same reason.

I'm going to admit to a low confidence here and ask you to please 
amplify your response.  How do you compare politics and 
psychotherapy, and how does that play into issue negotiation?

I am glad that you have tackled this question, as it often raises 
itself in my mind as well.
Lee Daniel Crocker:
>Benevolence and non-violence are probably not evolutionarily stable
>strategies, in that they are susceptible to exploitation.  

I refer you to Franz de Waal's _Peacemaking Among Primates_, which 
contains ethological studies of various primate species.  He wrote the 
book upon the discovery that each primate species has a unique social 
structure that contains a component of resolving disputes in a 
nonviolent manner, and that the behavior could be actively instigated 
by one or more members of the group.  

The view that those who practice nonviolence and acts of benevolence 
are somehow more vulnerable fails to take into account the economic 
aspects of such behavior.  You mentioned that one on one relationships 
can be viewed as a contract--well, so can larger societal relationships.  
Acts of benevolence cement the contracts, and they also represent 
expenditures that can be recouped in a later time of need.  The social 
contract:  If person A carries out an act of benevolence towards person 
B, and later person A is in need, it may not necessarily be person B who 
grants an act of benevolence to person A, but person C would upon the 
expectation that s/he would also be helped in a time of need.  Acts of 
non-benevolence will break this contract, and acts of violence will 
void it altogether.

(Now that nonviolence has been mentioned, I predict that within three 
postings we'll have an argument about gun control...prove me wrong, 
please!)

The problem with socialism is that it often limits economic growth, as well
as individual freedom. While i'm by no means an absolute/complete
anarchist, and free market capitalist. 'Forcing' people into being
altuistic, like it is being done today, is not my idea of an ideal society
either.

Actually i just noted in the other thread that i assumed extropianism
believes in the old liberal/humanist idea that people will automatically do
what is good for them, and that this itself will bring benefit to society
as a whole.  

My point excactly was that the more education people receive, the better
they will be able to do so. A system like they propose *could* go spiraling
down in a few generations, if there is no coordination, there is no
guarantee that it will, but there is no guarantee that it won't. Problem is
to find a form of coordination (a social contract if you will) which still
leaves complete individual freedom intact. Extropianism suggests a
completely voluntary system, which i believe in. Just not with the same
kind of blind optimism that the system will take care of itself, of some of
the other people on this list. 

It's funny to be on the other side once, defending the ideas of the people
i normally 'criticize'. But i think you'll find a great difference here in
'degrees' to which people believe in this system. And as they told me when
i joined, 'you don't have to be a libertarian in order to be an extropian'.
My experience is you automatically become a moderate libertarian when you
stay on this list long enough ;-) 

I also wonder how many of the individualists here call themselves 'true'
extropians. How the hell do you organise individualists or anarchists ?.
Maybe it's like in that monty python movie 'life of brian' when brian says:
don't follow me: 'you are all individuals', and the crowd replies
simultaneously: 'Yes we are all individuals!' We're individualists, yet we
all seem to have flocked together on this list, instead of mailing to
eachother via our own lists, which you should expect from ultra-
individualists really. It makes us a rather bizarre, but all the more
interesting 'collective'. :-)

 I wonder though, giving lawmakers the opportunity once a generation to
re-enact laws would possibly give them ample opportunity to add on more
and more garbage, giving us a legal version of bloatware. At least once
a law is passed it stays passed and can't be screwed with that much.

Personally, I would go in the other direction, making  the passing of
laws an irreversable act tantamount to a constitutional amendment, and
requiring supermajority voting to enact. THis would force lawmakers to
really mean it when they pass a law. Seems to me that most of the "good"
laws or acts of congress typically pass by an overwhelming majority,
while the rest that are nothing but hindrances are typically simple
majority passers.

I wonder if there are any other extropians going to ACM'97.
This is 50th anniversary of ACM, so the event should be
quite interesting.  I am going to be there between Feb, 28
to March, 4. - you can find me at the Firefly stand in the
San Jose convention center.   Maybe, if there are many
enough people going, we can organize a gathering one of
the evenings?

        It is mostly because we recognize the fact that we are individuals
and that we have a common pursuit.  Other than our common desire for future
progress and liberty (in the truest sense), most of us are doubtlessly quite
different from one another.  We acknowledge the fact that our sense of unity
is different than the standard sense of unity, which indeed makes
us an interesting collective.

Sure i just meant to point out that a rational combination of the two could

A pure free market system has the same problem. People with loads of money
value that money much lower, than people with less money.

Every item you buy, before i buy it, will become cheaper for me. Everything
i don't buy before you buy it will be more expensive for you. 

Its a wonderful system, yet it's not without flaws.

If you were as rich (or even richer) as bill gates, and you like 'egg in
your beer', you could decide to buy 10.000.000 crates of it and give them
away for free. The company that produces it will be able to manufacture it
cheaper, maybe even cheaper than other 'beers'. Who knows, such an action
may even result in other brands going bankrupt if its done well enough.

I can still see where a complete free market system can become a system
where the 75% masses become a toy for top 0.0001% of the rich. Now where
does that leave all you second house, 4 mercedes families ?

Excactly, combined with the soviet like collectives that will occasionally
overthrow them.

What a wonderful future: We get a choice between being exploited by the
extremely rich, or a dictatorial collective instead of our current state.  

Moderate 'social' measures have their function. They are to protect the
part of the population that lies between that 75% and the top 0.0001% from
excactly this.

Bringing levels of organisation down to more local levels is ofcourse an
obvious option for this 'class' in society. But IMO not a very good
solution for the world, the economy and the future as a whole.

>When one rich man says no, maybe another will say yes.

True, which is exactly why i feel that just a much more minimalized state
will do the trick. 

>Do you believe in planners' altruism?

No i don't. 

I don't know excactly what i am politically yet, maybe someone can tell me: 

I'd like to see a system with the highest level of individual freedom,
combined with a free market economy, one where there is consent from the
population through a far more democratic system than we have today, but far
less bureaucratic and with a much less influencial state. BUT: With a swift
and sure instrument left intact to act ONLY in crisis situations, with a
rapid concentration of power and resources the scope of that which the
Roman consuls had.

Not faith. The evidence, at least on this earth, is toward increasing

What?  A law can be amended at any time.  If the law itself actually

of the old law.  Which leads to an ever more bloated situation.

no, but if everybody tries their best to do so, we will get a situation

We're both arguing situations here neither of us wants to see happening.
Yours exist, mine is hypothetical, which is why i am on your side, for the
moment. Breaking off the state step by step, maybe the only way to see what
happens, before taking such a big risk.

I very definitely do NOT believe that is true.

I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to drive you
out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then
I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget
you sell, the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do,
but I'm lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very low
the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must build
more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster,
meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait
for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                                 


        >[profit is not good when] 1) when that profit is not re-inserted 
        >into society by spending/consuming. 


How could that be? If I don't spend it but put the profit in the bank then
the money will be loaned out for other profitable ventures.
                    

        >2) profit can be made by ways that undermine the free market system.
        >monopoly positions, patents, etc...


The only monopoly that is dangerous is government, the very biggest one, 
because the only successful cartels in history are the ones that have
government support.
          
Your company and mine produce all the steel made in the world. We make a good
profit now, but we want more, so we get together and triple our prices.
Now we each make a huge profit on each ton of steel we sell, so we would both
want to make lots and lots of steel. However, because the price of steel is
now very high demand is down, so part of our sinister plot must be an
agreement to limit production. The higher the price gets, the greater is the
temptation to secretly cheat on the agreement and produce more steel than was
agreed to and that would kill the cartel.

There are even more problems for our poor cartel. Now that the price of steel
is sky high and the profits are huge, other companies will want to get in on
the act and start making steel. Also, consumers of steel will not want to
shell out all that money for steel and will start looking for replacement
materials like wood or plastic or aluminum or composite fiber. 

OK I will admit that one type of monopoly, called a "natural monopoly" would  
work in a free market, but they don't bother me. In a few, very rare 
instances, the most efficient size of a factory is so big that there is only  
room for one, the best example is aluminum production. A larger steel mill is  
not more efficient than a smaller one, it's just bigger, but for physical  
reasons that's not true for an aluminum plant, the bigger the better.

However even a natural monopoly is limited to what it can do. If they raise  
prices too high a competitor with a smaller factory will step in. The small  
factory is not as efficient as the big one, but by accepting a smaller profit  
margin they can still charge less for aluminum than the big company. And of 
course, there is always the competition from other materials. 

This logic did not phase the US government when in it's infinite wisdom it  
decided to break up Alcoa Aluminum. What dreadful crime had Alcoa committed?  
The government said it had kept competitors out. What dastardly method did  
Alcoa use to do this? The government said Alcoa used the most advanced 
technology available to produce Aluminum that was just too cheap for  
competitors to match. How very dreadful! I wish I was joking about this, but  
I am not. If you can't beat them in the market place, lobby the government to  
send in their goons to destroy your competition.

There is some truth in that, but all proposed societies are composed of

I don't think that's a very good example, government has not come up with a
solution to that problem either. If individuals will not voluntarily 
contribute to a project to save their lives, then why would they vote for 
a politician who would force them to?

People can be altruistic, each year they voluntarily contribute hundreds of
billions of dollars to charity, if government was not stealing half their
income they would contribute even more.

Making money is one form of profit but most certainly not the only form, or 
the most important. If I learn something new about the world then I have
profited, if I do something that makes me happy then I have profited from it.
The Free Market maximizes all forms of profit.
             

        >a free market system relies heavily on chance: the chance that
        >problems in society will be tackled by making them profitable. 


People do not like problems, they will pay money to have them solved.
Of course the market can not solve a problem if it is not recognized as such,
but no other system can do that either.


        >a chance which in my opinion offers no guarantees

You only find guarantees in Mathematics, in the world of human affairs all
you can do is make your best bet, and the best bet is the market.
             

        >the profit principle will result in individuals and companies not
        >directing their efforts to simply activities that are profitable,
        >but instead will focus mainly on those that are THE MOST PROFITABLE.


In other words the most effort will be diverted to solving those problems
that most people judge to be most serious. As it is not reasonable to expect
to solve all of the worlds problems at the same time, that seem like an
efficient use of limited resources to me.

Here is what the List of Lists says about us.  
Does it need updating?
The maintainer is arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva).

    Purpose: Extropians is devoted to the discussion and development
    of Extropian ideas. The term "Extropian" was coined by the publishers
    of the journal "Extropy", which is devoted to Extropian philosophy.
    This list is a spinoff of the journal. Extropians may be roughly
    described as those simultaneously interested in anarchocapitalist
    politics, cryonics (and other life extension techniques), the
    technological extension of human intelligence and perception,
    nanotechnology, spontaneous orders, and a number of other related
    ideas. If you are an Extropian, the concept that these are all
    related topics will seem natural.

    All Extropians (and those who suspect that they are Extropians)
    are invited to join. The list is run from a commercial site and
    to strictly cover costs there is a fee charged to join the list,
    $14 per year (less for ExI member and Journal subscribers and
    students). A 30 day free-trial is given to all subscribers.

i think people have a list of priority problems, and the lowest on the
list, of those with money will never get solved. problem is that some of
the lowest priority problems for those with money can be some of the
highest priority problems for people with little money. A dangerous
situation for the rich if you ask me. 

A good example is that of our failure to find a solution to increase the
standard of life in third world countries. Is it so strange that people who
live in a country where people die because there are not enough hospitals,
want to move to a country where they have hospitals for their pets ? This
is an example of a system without coordination on a global level. Now some
people on this list want to bring that coordination back to even smaller
levels of operation. Can't you see the problems that will imply ? Don't
look at it from a socialist or altruistic point of view, look at it from a
point of pure self interest. If we don't teach people to provide for
themselves, they will come and steal the wealth from those who have it. A
stable economy is just as important for poltical stability as vice versa.
This also goes for smaller levels of operation. No education results in a
poor standard of living, and this often results in criminal behaviour. 

Education is the key to the future. A pure free market system can't
guarantee a fair amount of social mobility through education. As it is
based on keeping the 'have nots' dumb. The more difficult it will be for an
individual to break that circle the more limited his freedom if you ask me.  

A free market system can work, but not without guarantees. I'm not talking
about giving away things or sharing the wealth here, i'm talking about
investing in people so that they will be able to work themselves into a
position where they can buy more of your services or goods. Make them able
to contribute to the wealth of society as a whole, instead of becoming
criminals or social parasites. A free market offers no guarantees for that,
however bad the state education system is, at least it does this somewhat.    

A system which relies purely on charity to deal with these problems is
out of date and unrealistic. I think you'll find the new generations are a
lot more selfish than the older ones. Take it from me: pensions have seen
their last days. (most of your US tax dollar go to this, twice as much as
to the military, which comes second) Education should  be first (and maybe
the only thing) on this list if you ask me.

Let's try another scenario.  I manufacture x% of the world's widgets,
and you manufacture y% (the numbers are irrelevant).  Your widget is
better.  It is better designed, more reliable, and manufactured with
fewer defects.  In addition, thanks to your company's superior
management and manufacturing capability, your widget is produced at
lower cost which allows you to price it more competively than mine. 
Your market share is growing while mine is shrinking.  In a perfect
world in which no one would ever play dirty, you would win dominance
in the widget market and I would be forced to either perform better
or find some other niche.  But I have another option.  You are a
successful but still small start up with only a single product on
which you are completely dependent.  I am a giant corporation with
hundreds of profitable products and vast resources.  I could give
widgets away free of charge for years without any significant
suffering.  So I capture the widget market the same way I captured
some of the others.  I lower my prices to levels you can't compete
with, and I increase my marketing efforts to levels that you can't
afford. Soon, I have most of the market share and you are out of 
business. I return my pricing to profitable levels and scale back the
marketing and ride on my already established name recognition.  The
coming years of dominating the widget market will easily compensate
for my losses while driving you out of business.  I, with my
inferior product, inferior management, and inefficient production,
have won.  

This is survival of the richest.  Not survival of the fittest.

The standard Libertarian (and Republican) belief is that free market
economies inherently favor the smartest, hardest working
entrepreneurs and best products.  This is true.  But they also hold
a belief that this principle causes free market economies to be
inherently stable and fair.  This is not true.  There are other
forces than can operate within such an economy that can defeat the
built-in self-correcting mechanisms. When you begin with a scenario
in which wealth is distributed fairly evenly, then a free market
economy will work very well and will result in high productivity,
with clear benefits for those who produce and denial of those
benefits for those who do not. This is the kind of thriving middle
class economy that the U.S. has benefitted from for many decades. But
as such an economy becomes increasingly polarized (meaning a smaller
part of the population controlling a greater part of the wealth,
shrinking middle class, etc.) a free market economy will begin to
self destruct if it does not have some external compensating force. 
Those who control great wealth can win even when market dynamics
should have made it otherwise.  Likewise, those who control little
wealth will often not see rewards that reflect their level of
prodictivity, thus diminishing the incentive to be productive.

There is capitalism the economic principle, which has both benefits
and problems.  Then there is capitalism the religious belief which,
according to it's proponents, is self-correcting and will always 
result in optimization if left entirely to it's own devices.  I find 
it strange that Extropians with their affinity for reason and 
distaste for irrational belief would exhibit so much more faith than 
reason when it comes to economics.  It is for this reason that I 
cannot consider myself an Extropian even though I share their sense 
of optimism and agree with nearly all of their transhumanistic goals.

Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.  We can address the
imperfections and create an economy that works, or we can deny the
imperfections and create one that does not.

Don't get too enamoured with labels.  Not everything that falls under
the definition of "capitalism" is good.  Not everything that falls
under the definition of "socialism" is bad.  The first can generates
high productivity but is unstable.  The second can create stability
but kills productivity.  Neither system works well in it's purest
form.  Any realistic solution will either involve elements of both,
or will be something so completely different that it bears little
resemblence to either. 

Consider that with the potential offered by automation,
self-replicating machines, nanotechnology, quantum computers,
transhumans/posthumans, exploitation of off-planet resources etc.,
the ability to supply products and services will likely become
vastly greater than it is now.  Both capitalism and socialism are
attempts to address scarcity.  Neither can adequately deal with a
world of plenty.  This inadequacy is already apparent even with
existing production capabilities.  With the automation technology
that is available today, standards of living should be much higher
than what they are.  But existing economic systems cannot adequately
deal with these newly acquired abilities.

                                        Peace,
                                        William Kitchen

This reminds me of a routine commedian Steve Martin did years ago in
which he taught the audience his "Nonconformist's Credo" (or
something to that effect).  It went like this:

Martin: "Repeat after me"
Martin: "I promise to be different"
Audience: "I promise to be different"
Martin: "I promise to be unique"
Audience: "I promise to be unique"
Martin: "I promise not to repeat things other people say"
Audience: "I promise.....  (breaks up with laughter)

I got a pleasant surprise when I opened up my New York Times this Sunday 
morning (Feb. 23 1997). This is the headline of the lead story on page 1, 
"SCIENTIST REPORTS FIRST CLONING EVER OF ADULT MAMMAL", in slightly smaller 
type under that "Researchers Astounded; In Procedure On Sheep Fiction Becomes
True And Dreaded Possibilities Are Raised".

Dr. Ian Wilmult of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh Scotland has taken one 
cell from an adult sheep and made a clone from it. The clone was born last 
July and seems normal and healthy, genetic tests have shown it is indeed an  
exact clone of the original. Dr. Wilmult said that the same procedure should 
work for any mammal, including humans. I don't know many more details, 
the full report will be in the British Journal "Nature" on Thursday.

Dr. Lee Silver of Princeton University said this came just in time for him to  
revise his new book so it will no longer say that cloning is and will always 
be impossible, now he says " It basically means that there are no limits. 
It means all of Science Fiction is true. They said it could never be done and
now here it is, done before the year 2000." Naturally self proclaimed medical 
"ethicist" are very upset, Lori Andrews said "I can see it going on  
surreptitiously,[...] I can imagine new crimes". I agree with Dr. Ronald  
Munson, "Incredible! The genie is out of the bottle. This technology is not 
in principle policeable".

Hmm, yes, I would *like* to believe this, but isn't it sometimes the
case that there can be a problem that nobody (except a few experts, say)
*sees* as a problem (or nobody *wants* to see as a problem - say the
presence of large numbers of automobiles, for instance), so nobody seeks
a solution to the problem, so the market won't find one?  Isn't this the
sort of thing Joost is talking about?

I'm always torn by this question: do we admit that some people may be in
a position to notice things most of us can't or won't, and do we grant
them power to effect changes that would be beneficial to us all?  (Take
a look at Mancur Olson's work, for instance, where he shows that  majority
interests often gets shafted by better organised minority interests) 
Then you get into "Who watches the watchmen?" stuff - a *very* old and
knotty problem.

Or do we stick to the theoretical hardline and define that possibility
away (as in the Misesian type of praxeological analysis, where wants are
revealed only in actual market interactions, for example)? Ought we to do
this for the sake of taking the moral high ground? (Then you get into
debates about consequentialism!)

(This is perhaps the modern equivalent of the old "we know what's best
for you better than you do yourself" thing that socialists used to be so
fond of.)

I dunno.  Like Joost, I love the market, and value it highly, but can't
avoid having some reservations. I like the logic of a-c arguments; but
on the other hand, perhaps there is some kind of hidden wisdom (a la
Hayek) in the idea that 'we' do need some sort of collective power on
some occasions. Perhaps a-c is itself just another form of 'constructivist
rationalism', as some anti-libertarians would argue!  

(I think I would be comfortable with a collective organ, so long as it
didn't itself break the law in its activities - the straight classical
liberal position, I suppose.)

Clearly, this will precipitate a firestorm of discussion and a lot of
reactions like those quoted above.  I suggest we focus very closely on the
public reaction and use the List here to share any information about
developing attempts to outlaw this technology.  Assuming this result is
verified, it obviously has tremendous potential.  I'm almost sorry it
happened before our ideas have had more time to take root and serve as a
memetic inocculation against this sort of knee-jerk response. . .

Has anyone read the new book by David Boaz (of the Cato Institute),
"Libertarianism"? I saw it in Barnes and Noble and wondered if it would be
worth buying as an intro book to loan out.

I also glanced through Charles Murray's new book on libertarianism but
didn't feel much urge to buy it.

I'm not sure how beneficial this will be to us as individuals.
The ability to make clones in itself will not allow individuals to
improve their own genetics.  No doubt the technique will allow new
research directions which will shed useful light on various diseases
and genetic problems, but if we focus on human cloning itself I don't
see many direct benefits.

There are serious problems raised as well.  Let us suppose that it
becomes relatively common for people to choose to give birth to a
clone of an existing person rather than a new individual with randomly
chosen genetics.  You can get a sure thing rather than a crap shoot.
Of course the sure thing may lack any of the parents' genes, but the
experience of people who adopt children suggests that this may not be
much of a barrier.  You can have a child who is virtually guaranteed to
be a genius, or have marvelous atheletic or musical talent, or to be a
physical beauty, simply by cloning an adult with these characteristics.

Or people may choose to clone themselves, Mommy's little girl and Daddy's
little boy.  Everyone who ever secretly wanted a twin sibling can now
get their wish, albeit gratification delayed.  You can raise your clone
just the way you would have wanted to be raised.

These are new ideas and it is easy to have a knee-jerk negative reaction,
but maybe they aren't that bad.  We could actually see a tremendous
improvement in productivity and creativity, especially if we believe that
progress is largely caused by the most talented people.  There could
be a whole generation of scientific geniuses, composers, entertainers.
It could be a new renaissance as the human race ascends to a higher level,
a big step towards the Singularity.

At the same time there are obvious problems with such a society.  A
child who grows up as a clone is going to be facing an unusual set of
expectations.  Hopefully his innate talents will be in close accordance
with his pre-programmed career goals, so that the Michael Jordan clones
will take to basketball as soon as they can walk.  And these would not
be the first people to find they were born to greatness; think of the
industrial or royal heirs of the past.  Many people have thrived in such
an environment.  After some trial and error, clones can be identified
who do so as well.  But the casualties along the way could be very ugly.
And I doubt that the mommy-clones will do well very often.

The loss of diversity could be a long term problem, as we fix on the
best people in the current gene pool without doing the continual search
needed to find better people to clone.  This is like a simulated annealing
optimization program where you cool it too fast.  It would be better to
have a lot of the Einsteins marry the lady geniuses, hoping to get some
even-better kids out of the mix to serve as future clone sources.  Social
problems could arise as well as more people fell into just a few clonal
families; without the broad range of human characteristics we have today
people might feel alienated from others who were too different from them.

Ownership of genetic code is an interesting problem with a lot of
similarities to today's debate about intellectual property.  Copying
someone's genetic code (which might in theory be possible simply by
stealing a few flaked-off skin cells) doesn't hurt him any; he hasn't
lost anything by it.  Should a person be able to control how and when
new clones of himself are made?  If so, how about second-generation copies?
Can the Van Cliburn clones make money by cloning themselves, or do they
have to pay royalties to their "upline"?

Overall, this is a very mixed bag.  I suppose one important fact is that
by the time humans are cloned and grown, enough other changes will have
occured that this will be just one of many ways that people will be able
to control their biology.  But hopefully the newer technologies will
give people control over their own bodies rather than their children's.

I agree completely. Cloning per se is not a useful way to enhance one's 
own life, except in some applications.

Beware of genetic determinism! While it is certainly quite possible to 
give birth to children that have good preconditions for becoming athletes 
or musical, much more than that is required. I seriously doubt Beethoven 
would have become the great composer he became if he grew up in a middle 
class american family. Some studies implies that geniuses while 
intelligent, almost always excelled mainly because of early and through 
training (due to good teachers or personality). Giving your cloned child 
the right upbringing is even harder than bringing up a child in general, 
since you try to nurture traits you believe it has big potential in.

I have a friend who would like to try this, placing clones of himself in 
a variety of families and creating a group of versions of himself as he 
could be.

This is also a problem with genetic improvements and actively 
trying to bring up children into geniuses. It is worth studying how to 
deal with it, both in terms of how to help the child and how to deal with 
the often unrealistic expectations of the parents.

Hmm, shouldn't it be possible to copyright one's genome? That means 
replication of it without permission is not allowed. 

> Should a person be able to control how and when
> new clones of himself are made?  If so, how about second-generation copies?

Sound reasonable. But once the clone is accepted as a person, he can 
justly claim the ownership of his own genome and making any clones of 
himself is his decision, not the original clone (hmm, I have to watch 
Multiplicity, I think).

Just finished reading a little book on Quantum Mechanics. It focuses
on the interpretational issues and points out that the Copenhagen
Interpretation is actually the most radical. Most of the other views
are essentially a continuation of the usual mysticism about
consciousness
and observation. It has some cogent descriptions of how to look at
the measurement process as a quantum system and how the decoherence
idea works. All done with only one simple equation. All of those on
this list who like to discuss QM and consciousness should read this...

Cool.  I saw this book in the bookstore a few months ago, and looked at
the last part (I'm getting annoyed by every pop quantum book spending
2/3 of itself on the double-slit experiment and associated weirdness.
The risks of already knowing the background.)  It seemed pretty neat and
materialistically appealing, but I wasn't sure enough to buy it.

Application: growing a fetal clone of yourself, then dismantling it for
the stem cells or nascent organs.  Fetal tissue has been used for its 
lack of immune provocation; cloned fetal cells should be really benign.
This would require artificial wombs or a big growth in the surrogate
pregnancy industry.  

Not to mention growing clones on life support to adulthood to have
mature organs ready if needed.  Or a young body to stick your brain in.

Right to lifers will not be happy.

This may be assuming genetic factors play a much-much larger role than
environmental factors.  I might suggest that given the opportunity to
develop as freely as possible (given the circumstances), a clone may
develop along a completely different path than its predecessor.  In
fact, it may develop along a completely different path if others try to
mold it;  I.e. it will never have the same experiences as its former.

Of course, we have now have the key to determining which of these
arguments is correct. . .

Suppose I'm an employee of "Joe's Protection Agency, Inc" and happen to
see two guys fighting down an alleyway... how do I know whether to
intervene if I don't know whether either of them are clients of my agency? 
I could break up the fight and then ask for membership cards, but if
neither are members I've wasted my time and risked harm for no reason.

Are people assumed to protect themselves from that kind of thing and only
call on the protection agency if the situation gets out of hand? This
obviously works for crimes which are reported after the fact, but not if
someone attacks me while I'm walking down the street. 

Or are protection agencies supposed to be location-based?

An interesting point.  There shouldn't be any problems with owning your
own genetic code in its entirety, but what about smaller portions?  It's
been a while since I've studied genetics, but I believe there are
tremendous amounts of reoccurring patterns in our exon DNA.  I'm not
sure about the intron material.  It would be interesting trying to use
introns as a type of PGP signature or copyright mark, but I'm afraid it
would be too easily circumvented.  Any 'current' geneticists out there?

Backtracking a bit, I wonder if it could be well argued for the parent's
ownership of a child's code?  (Another factor for divorce court. . .) 
If the code is owned by each individual, would it be illegal for the
parents to manufacture twins?

Regarding ownership of one's one code:  If a clone was made by the owner
(in this example one's self) and now two individuals owned rights to the
code, as you've suggested, the legalities of one clone selling genetic
information to another party might be interesting.  Also, what happens
if an illegal (as defined by this example) clone were made?  Clearly it
could not be denied its rights, could it?

Finally, how long would one's genetic material remain under copyright? 
How long after death?  Depending on that answer, who owns the currently
deceased?  If it is public domain, do we have the right to exhume their
bodies and claim our property?

It is unfortunate that these questions will have to be answered very
soon and probably without much deliberation.

Distributing the wealth evenly is not needed and will do a lot of damage
early on, it could take years before the economy restores from such a blow,
and many people will lose their confidence in the system, as who is to say
such a redistribution is not scheduled again, and again ?, and what then
would be the motivation to be succesful ?. IMO a good system of social
mobility through a guaranteed high quality educational system will do the
trick, and far more efficiently.

Subject: Human Cloning: The Trade-In Strategy
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

What follows may sound a little crazy, but the news about successful adult
mammal cloning and the reaction that's already apparent has set my brain to
boiling.

As I'm sure most of you have already realized, this technology suggests a
"quick and dirty" approach to transcending the "natural" human lifespan.
 Assuming that the technology for repairing broken neural pathways continues
to develop as quickly as it has seemed to in the last couple of years, it
appears that cloning up a replacement body and transplanting the brain is a
pathway that is almost within reach.  This assumes that the donor body can be
developed in such a way that its brain does not develop a consciousness or
personality.  This last point presents some technical challenges, to be sure,
but nothing that can't be overcome with near-term technology.  For discussion
purposes, let us call this the "trade-in" strategy.

As I mentioned in my shoot-from-the-hip first reaction posted to the list, I
sense that we'll see a massive reaction against this technology.  It's
entirely possible that the media will quickly transform this into a political
hot potato and that the politically "safest" way to deal with it will be to
ban it.

Fortunately, it sounds like the basic technology isn't that complicated.  It
isn't hard for me to imagine a facility being developed outside the US in
which "trade-ins" could be cloned and developed.  All that's needed is a
basic genetics lab, a source of host mothers and then whatever it takes to
maintain the trade-ins.  The actual transplant technology won't be needed for
at least 15-20 years, obviously.

Of course, folks who will want to take advantage of the trade-in strategy
should optimally get their first clone going at around age 40, so that a
fresh 20-year-old body is waiting for them when they get to be 60.  (The way
I feel some mornings now, I'm thinking starting one at 20 might not be a bad
idea :-)

The point is this: This idea will certainly occur to a lot of people, and
very soon.  Creating relatively secure and, probably more important, secluded
facilities for this endeavor ought to be a high priority for people who can
afford it.  Certain areas of southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America would
seem well-suited to siting such facilities.

Assuming interest in such an idea, how might these facilities be developed?
 Obviously, a network of the right people would need to be developed to bring
together money and expertise.  Biologists and physicians willing to work on
the idea would have to be brought together with investors willing to put a
great deal of capital into developing the facilities, which would then have
to be built and managed.  The Alcor organization of course seems a prime
candidate to serve as an initial node for developing such a network.  I
wonder if anyone is interested in this idea?

(And yes, BTW, I just happen to be reading "The Lost World," Michael
Crichton's sequel to "Jurassic Park" right now . . .)

With this message i'd like to apologize for being a newbie, i just joined

sometimes.

I'd like to note though that i am here to learn, and that i hope this is
slowly starting to show in my postings. 

Thank you for your patience and i hope that the things i'm bringing up are

A few random thoughts on this subject:


1) No matter what happens, the clone will be wholly different from the
'clonee' at the point of cloning.  As I stated a few months back in my
theory of consciousness, the clone and the clonee will be their own
entities.  Even in the most sheltered cases, the clone will at least have
a different point of view as the clonee.  The streams of consciousness will
ultimately be different between the two.  The cells that replenish and die
will be different cells; for example, if the clone accidentally scratches
his\her\its hand, the replenishment of cells will take a different course
than the cells on the unscratched hand of the clonee.
In effect, the likeness of the clones (not particularly physical likeness)
will gradually differ.

                                       /
                  pre-cloning         /
                ---------------------*        post-cloning
                                      \
                                       \
                                        \


2) In some ways, it is unfortunate that this cloning technology didn't
develop until after an adequate space program had been established.  As Hal
Finney mentioned, it will take the general population a while to warm up to
the idea of cloning.  I think it would be quite beneficial to send an
umpteen amount of individual clones on a number of spaceships heading in
various directions to colonize distant planets etc.  Not to say that this
won't happen eventually.

3) I wonder (in the advent that this technology becomes usable within a few
decades) if there will be a prejudice or a fear towards clones.  With the
lack of tolerance and acceptance for many 'minority' groups today (however
irrational it may be) such as gays and different races, it is possible that
clones will be dubbed as 'abnormal' or --as I can envision religious groups
protesting-- sacreligious and blasphemous.  That would be unfortunate, in
that it would be a regressive step.

I don't see anything of the sort.  In fact, I'm rather dismayed that
the press is treating this cloning success as something interesting,
when it's really nothing special or useful at all.  We already know
exactly what the relationship between two genetically identical beings
is: we've seen identincal twins for centuries.  Clones just happen to
be identical twins of more different ages, so the "identity" issue is
even more irrelevant there.  And a clone of yourself, while it might
be nice to have a child with 100% of your genes instead of 50%, would
probably die young after being infected with germs from you that have
had 100s of generations to adapt to your--and therefore his--immune
system.  That's probably why sexual reproduction is here in the first
place (I find Ridley's arguent compelling).  The genetic mixing helps
a long-generation organism keep ahead of the short-generation bugs.

Why expend effort on genetic stagnation?

I'll second your good review.  I read this about 6 months ago, and
got a much better appreiciation for the issues, and in paricular
for the real significance of Bell's inequality and its implications.

Item in Feb 97 issue of Electrosphere at Wired:

Neuroscientist Theodore Berger is working real hard to be the first person 
to implant microchips between your ears.

During the past four years, Berger and a seven-member team of scientists - 
experts in everything from semiconductors to the neurophysiology of tissue 
cultures - have worked ceaselessly at the University of Southern California 
in Los Angeles to unlock the brain's complex mathematical model so they can 
bridge the gap between silicon and cerebrum. "If we can speak to the brain 
in its own language then we begin to understand the biological basis of 
thought and learning," says the 46-year-old scientist. "It's a matter of 
understanding the way neurons act and react in every conceivable situation, 
then building a device that can duplicate their basic functions and 
transmit the appropriate electrical impulses."

Another area where people feel they know more than the professionals
is sports.  People involved in professional sports seem to have all
their decisions second guessed and vociferously criticized, from hiring
and salary decisions down to the selection of when to pass versus run
the ball.  And the fans seem very confident about their criticisms even
though most of them have never run or coached a professional team.

What do professional sports have in common with politics?

This is a very interesting idea, but I think it's going to take a lot more
research before it becomes possible to hook up the neural connections
between the brain and the new body.  There may not even be a one to one
mapping possible, especially if the new body has been quiescent, without
any active brain control.  The innervation patterns between the brain and
the muscles and sense organs is presumably at least partially dependent
on a lifetime of usage patterns.  The clone won't have the same brain/body
interface as the person.

This is a different problem than repairing broken neural pathways,
because in that case you know that there is a mapping that works, you
just have to induce the nerves to re-grow.  Even in that case I doubt
that a complex neural network, like the spinal cord, could be expected
to regrow spontaneously with correct connections.

I am afraid that at best you are looking at years of physical therapy
to learn to use the new body, and since the brain is not as plastic
as an adult as it is when you are young, you will probably never have
completely reliable control or sensation.

And how about the brain cells?  Don't they age, with toxic byproducts
building up, DNA damage, etc.?  I don't have the impression that brain
tissue is particularly immortal.  If not, then even if transplanting
worked it may not help much for extending maximum life span because the
brain will die in a few years anyway.

If you have such bizarre ideas about what a free market is, no wonder
you have reservations.  Free markets don't encourage the best products,
and never have.  They encourage the economically most efficient products.
If you have a quality product, but it costs a dollar more than people
can pay for an inferior one, or it came to market a few weeks later,
you'd better not bet your mortgage on it.  Just look at the software
industry: a buggy product /now/ is "better" than a stable product in a
month, because people can do real work with it, get used to it, show
it to their friends, create data dependent on it, etc.

"Stable" is exactly what a free market isn't--and why it's superior to
any possible planned market.  Stability is stagnation.  Stability is
death.  The free market is just that--free.  Wild, careless, changing,
ALIVE.  "Fair" is a moral judgment, and since we agoriarchists define
the free market as the consequence of the moral principle that coercive
force is never justified to transfer property, it is the only system
that can be moral by definition.  If you have some other definition of
"fair", say, the most egalitarian in result, or the least random in
result, or the highest correlation of effort with reward, then some
system other than the free market might have that property, but it will
require coercion and will likely be less productive than a free market.

This is a common arguent, but plainly at odds with the evidence.  In
the one time in history when the US had about the freest market (in
the late 1800s), Standard Oil used every dirty trick in the book--
price fixing, undercutting, cartels, tying agreements with railroads,
even physical intimidation of competitors, to buy up over 85% of the
market in petroleum.  They never could get up to 90%, and after they
peaked they started falling, despite continued anti-competitive
practices.  By the time congress decided to meddle with the Sherman
Act (yes, /before/ the act was passed), their market share was 65%
and falling.  The Sherman Act actually helped them by preventing
their competitors from colluding against them.  No monopoly at any
time in history existed without government support.  Before you use
"monopolies" as an example if market failure, name one.  Just one.
One single example if a free-market monopoly taking advantage of its
position to people's detriment.  You can't--it's a myth.

> Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.  We can address the

As soon as you define "perfect" and "working", I'll be able to argue
rationally.  Until you do, your words are meaningless.  I have
defined my terms for you: a free market is the consequence of the
principle that coercive force is /never/ justified to take property.
Now that principle will have certain consequences about which we can
rationally argue.  But you must name them precisely and define them
objectively--stop using words like "fair", "just", or "good" until
you tell me what they mean.  If you have a specific meaning in mind,
it may well be that a free market won't accomplish that, and I'll be
the first one to tell you it doesn't.   In fact, it's likely that
what you have in mind for those words is not possible at all, under
any system.

Tell Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper competitors that.  I've forgotten
the details, but there was recently a trade war in which his vast slush fund
subsidised what were effectively give-aways for months on end (I believe),
which not only starved the other papers and drove them to the wall but had
the effect (or was so intended; I don't know how effective it was) of
shifting consumer loyalty/habit-of-purchase to his product.

Ritual.  I'm reading a book called "The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life,"
by Thomas Moore.  Moore talks about sports as providing occasion to
contemplate (not the same as think about) the big issues of life (and
this is the chapter I'm reading right now):

"Sports are especially important in our culture because apparently the soul
needs to contemplate its own reality much more frequently
than our style of life allows.  Some cultures are almost entirely
ritualistic and poetic, while our culture sees ordinary life as separate
from poetry and religion.  We have the arts, religion, and sports to
offer us the kind of ritual contemplation we need, but with the arts
made marginal to the culture and with religion in relative decline,
especially in its communal ritual elements [he means as opposed to the
superstitious and moralistic elements], we are left with sports as a
last resort."

Sports, including politics, provide something to care and have opinions
about, without the consequences, a big screen...  Oh, of course, did
someone mention how people set themselves up as experts on how
celebrities ought to live?

Minsky called music "chewing gum for the mind."  Similarly rituals like
politics are chewing gum for the heart and soul.  (But I hope in both
cases the danger of these dismissive phrases is apparent.)

At least we can use these clones as a human chop-shop so that we have spare
parts available in the event of an organ failure.

Correction (kinda):  The innervation patterns are critically dependent on
interaction between tissue and nerve, mostly in the womb and very early
childhood.  No interaction, no useful mapping.  The genes are short of the
necessary information to specify all connections, by many orders of
magnitude.

Also, identical genes do *not* generate identical body patterns.  Very
similar on the macro level, yes, but on a cell-by-cell level quite different.
 You couldn't switch brain parts even of identical twins from the same womb.

>The clone won't have the same 
>brain/body interface as the person.

Nope.  You'd have to microsurgically attach every optic and auditory, and
many tactile, nerve cells, individually.  Some won't match up to the new body
plan and will be useless, dying shortly after the transplantation.  Some
systems do regrow on their own - I know the pain system does.  But most
don't.

"Replacement bodies" is not an impossible task, but it's not near-term
either.

One serious problem with serial cloning is that cells accumulate genetic
errors with time.  I think the rate is about one mutation to active genetic
material per generation.  So any cell from your body would have at least a
few dozen genetic errors, all of which get inherited by the clone.  Part of
the point of sexual reproduction is to clear all this mess up.

If you have access to the _Washington Post_, check out page D5, Style 
Section, article entitled 'The Mind Gym'.  It describes a series of 
exercises that are being used with young children to increase mental 
capabilities, and they also have applications for adults.  The 
exercises are organized according to the mental function in need of 
strenghtening, such as memory or data processing.  For instance, 
rhythm and timing exercises can improve math abilities.  It is also 
suggested that drinking sufficient water and moving around throughout 
the day can help increase all mental skills.

I have seen this movement therapy work in amazing fashion for a friend 
who deals with severe dyslexia -- that person is in grad school now.

A book is also mentioned:  _Smart Moves, Why Learning is Not All in 
Your Head_ by neuropsychologist Carla Hannaford.

I have 2 Questions:
1) If rich people in western countries are not interested in paying money to   
   increase the standard of living in the third world, why is it likely that 
   the poorer people in western countries would be willing to pay?

This is not Mathematics, forget about certainty. In the real world no social

guarantees. I will admit that the market does better than government only 95% 
of the time, but we can live with a little inefficiency in the remaining 5%.

If you're really serious about the word "investing" then that's a job for

As an expert of widget manufacturing  I can form 3 conclusions.

   a ton of money. 
2) Widgets will not be free forever. 
3) I hope you are very stubborn and I hope you're corporation has a LOT of   
   money.

I buy (not the right word really, they're free) widgets by the warehouse full 
from you, if you can make them I will buy them and then ask for more. 
Now that demand is so huge you MUST build more widget factories if they are 
to remain free or even just cheap, and after you finished that factory you 
must build another one and then another. When the day comes when you regain
your sanity or just go broke I will have a huge supply of widgets that cost  
me nothing to obtain that I can sell for many years at an enormous profit.

Hal FInney and Curt Adams raise a serious question about the viability of the
"trade-in" strategy I suggested, that being the problem of incongruities in
the mapping of nerve connections between the original brain and the
ennervation pattern in the "trade-in" body.  Interestingly, on the same day,
Jeff Allbright points us to an article in Wired about the current state of
the art in brain-computer interfaces.  I wonder whether one part of the
solution to the mapping problem might not lie in further devlopments in that
technology.  Rather than a simple surgical or biochemical procedure of
connecting the neural pathways, perhaps each end of the connection could be
terminated in a "smart junction box", where the mapping process is assisted
with some sort of "external" or at least non-biological aid.  Developing the
new functional connections then might be a cooperative process of the
"trade-in" body, the transplanted brain and some fairly sophisticated
computer device.  Any thoughts on the viability of this approach?

Also, I wonder what the order of magnitude is that we're talking about here.
 I assume that much of the cranial nerve structure would be carried across
from the "original", e.g. the entire occular system, including the eyes
themselves, would be transplanted, rather than attempting a hook-up to the
"trade-in's" eyes.  This would be more difficult with the nerves that serve
the mouth and tounge, etc, but might not be insurmountable.  If this were
possible, then the connections across the spinal column would then be the
biggest challenge.  How many nerves are we talking about at that juncture?

Another thing to consider is that even though you can obviously use a copy
of your own body for spare parts, then these spare parts will have exactly
the same likelyhood to develop the diseases that is the reason to change
those parts.

Yes, the brain does age. Not as noticeably as other parts of the body, but
it does loose some neurons and accumulate lipofuchines (sp?) and other
likely waste-products. One intriguing theory about Parkinson's disease is
that the neurons of the substantia nigra simply age too fast (I don't know
if it has any support, though). Putting it into a new body might be
helpful, but it will not solve the basic aging. 

It is not known how long a brain could live "on its own" (there is no such
thing yet). It doesn't seem to loose efficiency as much as other parts of
the body, so likely it could live beyond 110 years if the rest of the body
was kept young, but we don't know for sure.

It depends on what diseases we are talking about. Genetic diseases are
obviously a problem, but if it is just a case for genetic predisposition
towards some diseases then a replacement part might be helpful. And
diseases that are due to external factors such as bacteria, viruses and
the environment (like excessive drinking) could be treated by fresh
organs. Of course, they are more likely to develop these diseases and
there are some immunological complications if antibodies have been
developed against the sick organ, but I think they might be a viable way
to extend life a bit more. 

I have only been in surgery once, and it was a relatively minor hernia
operation. Still, the fact that it hurt afterwards and it took me several
weeks to get back to my old activity level made me realize that we
sometimes speak a bit too casually about transplanting orgams, inserting
bionics and changing our bodies - even with good medical technology (and
care) it will be painful, expensive and take time. Sorry, no "heart
transplants while you wait" shops.

It ought to have; it will be an infant while the clonee is an adult. 
Sorry, we haven't got the faintest idea yet about how to fast-grow a

Clones are just younger identical twins.

Yes, prejudice is likely. On the other hand, it is hard to see if 
somebody is cloned ("Yes, he does look a lot like his father did when he 
was younger"). I seem to recall one of the stories in Flynn's _The 
Nanotech Chronicles_ which dealt with a clone family and some prejudices 
against it.

We need good neural interfaces, of course. The computational problem 
seems to be solvable in principle, but we need plenty of computing power. 
I would say this is a nanotech-level problem.

The relevant number is the number of axons in the nerves. We have 12 pairs
of brain nerves and the spinal cord to think about. I seem to recall on
the order of 1 million axons in the optic nerves, and as a guess around
the same in the spinal cord (these are just order-of-magnitude estimates). 
The other brain nerves are almost all much smaller, let's say they have 1
million axons together. The we get around 3 million axons to deal with.

     I've lurked on this list for some time, and unfortunately havent even 
     been able to read the digests for about 2 months. (Being responsible 
     for install of 5800 copies of netscape in 74 different branches about 
     country by a slew of people who dont want to help you can sap your 
     free time just a bit. :)
     
     I read with great interest the story on ccn.com yesterday about the 
     scientists that have cloned a sheep.
     
     Have we had a philosophical/ethical debate on Human cloning? (If we 
     have, I apologize, I've missed it)
     
     The first thing that came to mind was "The Cat Who Walks Through 
     Walls" where your clones are held in stasis to provide 'spare-parts'. 
     Imagine cloning a baby at birth. Imagine cloning from a cell in one of 
     those heads frozen at alcor.
     
     But what 'rights' do the clones have? Are they just more humans with 
     individual rights? Does the prime being have dominion over the clones, 
     and that perhaps a clone could have it's brain function 
     limited/clipped during it's gestation in order to keep the organism 
     purely a cell factory?
     
     An interesting debate surely.
     
     
     An interesting aside, although I rarely read comics anymore, I've been 
     unable to totally sever my ties to the IRON MAN comic book. In a 
     recent issue Tony Stark, Iron Man Himself, is trapped without his 
     armor by an armored super assassin. He tells the guy "If you dont 
     leave, I'm going to kill you. Look deep into my eyes and you'll know 
     it's true." And when the assassin looks at him a bright flash blinds 
     and dazes him. As Stark runs away he thinks to himself, "It's called a 
     magnesium flare, nanoteched onto contact lenses, I originally 
     developed them for riot control police."
     
     It's interesting to see where Extropic Ideas like nanotech end up in 
     mainstream media. Although I must admit, Iron Man tends to be rather 
     Extropic. He wears the armor chest plate to keep his heart beating 
     after it is damaged by shrapnel, he makes a list of books his 
     employees to read and it includes Toffler and Dawkins.

Linda Nagata fans might like to check out her Web page at
http://www.maui.net/~nagata/index.html

Her novels explore the potential limits of cryonics and, especially, 
nanotechnology.  Her latest is called _Deception Well_,  just 
published this month, and deals with the far future for a change. 
 Here is a snip of what she says about it:

<Complexity theory distinguishes between order and disorder (chaos) 
and places vital life precisely on the boundary. We thrive on the edge 
of chaos. That's a remarkable philosophy. It's a dynamic tension that 
serves as the core of my upcoming novel DECEPTION WELL, a "far-future 
cult thriller" ;-) set in a story world in which Earth has been left 
behind, three thousand years in the past, and war has become as subtle 
as ecological succession.>

I find her themes and thoughts to be fairly Extropian and certainly 
Transhumanist.  She also has some nice reviews of other recent scifi 
novels.

In case it hasn't been previously, let me make it perfectly clear that my
musings on this subject suppose use of cloned parts and whole bodies WITHOUT
functioning brains and associated consciousness and personalities.  A human
clone that has been allowed to develop naturally from birth is, without
question, a full human being entitled to all the respect and expectations of
reciprocity inherent in that status.

The most common concern about PPLs is that is that local competition
will soon result in local authoritarian monopolies, which may be
difficult to get rid of.  This seems to be the result of protection
agency like competition now in Russia.  Another concern is defense
free riding among PPLs making an area vulnerable to invaders.  So it
is not *obvious* we aren't better off with some sort of minarchy.  And
given minarchy, its not obvious how small a government we can actually
have.

This is also a real concern.  It doesn't do any good for my to buy
stronger punishment against assault or robbery, if potential criminals
don't know that I am different.  So houses covered by non-standard
laws need to post a mark to this effect (as houses now covered by
private patrols now do), and people on the street would need to wear
some distinguishing mark if they want buy extra deterrence.

I would expect the new sheep to become unhealthy when their "mother"
is old and decrepit; at which point they will be younger and decrepit.

In the context in which this was asked (i.e., why do people feel free
to ignore the "experts" in the two fields), I think the common thread
is that the average Joe gets to see the experts in both fields fail
miserably, and often.  Even when those failures are just the luck of
the draw from good decisions, it still looks like incompetence, so it
makes us feel like we could do better.

You could replace yourself with a jury of twelve voters instead.

Anyway, you've got statistics even in this case.  You're looking at a
legisture of N people composed of two random populations: N-M people
picked the usual way and M people picked this new way.  I don't see why
you'd expect a nonmonotonic effect, so that you'd prefer M = N to M =
0, but prefer M = 0 to M = 1.

Perhaps part of what changed was beliefs about "racial inferiority,
economic necessity, right of conquest", but I don't see these at
beliefs about what is moral.  If I believe it is moral to enslave
inferior races, and turn against slavery because I learn this race is
not in fact inferior, my moral beliefs have not changed.

Huh? There is no reason at all for this. I'm not even sure if the 
similarities in the immune systems will have any noticeable effect; it is 
quite good at randomizing its genes on its own.

John?  Sure, Murdoch's paper might be readable.  But say it costs $.50
to produce, at which price I prefer to read a different paper.  But when
Murdoch's paper is free, I'm willing to read it instead of the paper I
have to pay for.  Eventually that paper goes out of business and Murdoch
starts charging $.50 again.  Now I'd like to read something better, but
the competitor is out of business, and if it is non-trivial to start a
new paper I may be stuck with reading Murdoch or nothing.  So I read
Murdoch.  Not an ideal solution.

I'm not saying what should be done about it, or that something should be
done, but it does seem to be a sub-ideal solution at least, and if you
can't disprove that you should acknowledge it, or people you'd like to
convince will think you're a nut and not listen to you.

Since we are not going to put an adult brain into a newborn's
body, we would need another adult body.  An adult body is a
result of genetic code and years of growth and training in the
environment that has no purely genetic alternative. So we either
need a dramatically better (than cloning) technology to grow a
20-year-old body in a vat, or we get the clone to develop and
walk around as a human being, and then use this person for spare
parts.  The clone might not agree with it.  On the other hand,
some people may prefer to spend 20 or 25 years doing nothing
but playing sports and breathing fresh air to grow a perfect body,
to 80 years of education and work.  Hmm...  The happy clones may
identify themselves with the body a lot more than with the brain
(they don't have to be taught they have a brain!) so they may
not care if the brain is replaced...

I've been wondering: what is the absolute minimum state that could
stabilize something like David Friedman's competing private laws?

I assume that you'd need a large scale "state" to manage national
defense.  There would be serious free rider problems otherwise, and
there seem to be strong economies of scale to military coordination.

Given that this central defense system exists, I imagine
that it could be available to enforce contracts between competing
private laws.  That is, two laws could pay this central system to
adjudicate the contract between them, "sending in the army" to
punish/disband a violator.   

My first question is: is this enough to preserve local legal diversity?
Imagine some law held 40% of local customers, with the next highest
law holding 20% of customers.  And imagine that this law is going to
try to get 95%+ local market share.  This biggest law would seem to
have a lower monitoring/patroling cost.  For the same number of patrol
cars it gets to swing by twice as many customers.  So it might try to
lower prices to drive out competition.  

More severely, it might notice when no other law was patrolling the
customer of a competing law, and make some "accidents" happen to those
other customers.  The competing law might know it would cost it more
to compensate this with more monitoring, or retaliatory accidents, and
so be persuaded to leave the area.  Is there a contract laws could
write with each other ahead of time to assure customers that this
scenario would be very unlikely?

Depends on how you decide what will be given rights. Myself, I tend
towards the view that entities that demand or desire a right (which they
are presumed to understand) should be given it. Hence, if you clone
yourself the young clone-baby should be given all the rights that we give
ordinary babies (there is no practical distinction). If you create a
braindead donor-clone, it cannot demand or even desire rights, and it is
OK to use it as a cell factory. 

Apropos cloning for transplants, I suggest reading Greg Egan's ironic 
short story "The Extra":

The idea might be doable without magnesium using nanotech lasers... maybe.

In the scenario I presented, I did not propose that I *would* give
them away for free, but merely that my available resources were such
that I COULD do so without going broke.  What I proposed was
lowering the price to a level that would not allow you to compete
and still remain profitable.  I would lose money, but would not 
willingly incur any greater losses than were necessary.

That's the point.

That is two of the preconditions for the thought experiment.

This presupposes starting conditions that are significantly different
from my proposed scenario.  For this to work you would have to have
enough reserve resources, or a large enough alternative source of
revenue to go without profit while continuing to spend money for an
extended period of time, and I would have to have to be limited
enough in my resources that the losses on widgets would threaten my
economic survival.  In the proposed scenario, I am the one with the
vast resources.  You also assume that you could buy my widgets for
less than what it would cost you to make your own.  This isn't
necessarily the case.  All that is required to drive you out of
business is for me to sell them below your total cost including
marketing and distribution, they do not have to be priced below your
manufacturing cost.  Even if you buy them from me you still have to
market and distribute them.  Not a good situation for a company with 
little reserve capital and no other source of income.

My point in all of this was not to suggest that this kind of thing 
would happen at every possible opportunity, but merely that it can 
happen and does represent a flaw in pure free market economies.  A 
flaw that would be better addressed than ignored.

                                        Peace,

In what way is it "difficult" to simply stop paying a private business?
If you're going to raise objections to A-C, how about raising some that
might actually exist instead of making them up?  Russian mafias believe
in territoriality; they are not a free market.  Free riders are a minor
nuisance of the market that is exaggerated to the scale of major failure
to discredit it because the opposition can't come up with much better.
Lighthouses, dams, roads, and bridges get built with private money now,
despite both the free-rider "problem" of the market and the confiscatory
tax rates of the state.  We can get rid of the latter problem, but that
doesn't make the former problem worse, it makes it better.

We tried as many might recall creating PPL for this mailing list and
this was a very doomed effort. It's failure shouldn't be seem as a
failure to PPLs (they just might not work well for small mailing
lists).

We I think we learned a few things.

The first is that your PPL needs to be some what selective about who
it admits, much like the admission committees at private clubs, coops,
and condo's.

You might buy a particular type of deterrence as might an other member
say extra protection from those with Undergraduate degrees in English
(like myself). You even though you have this deterrence you might try
to avoid English majors, but an other member of the PPL, with
deterrence "in hand" so to speak, might start baiting English Majors
and even hanging out at "their" bars (making fights), and try to date
"members" of their population, etc.

The real cost for your membership and the cost of the membership for
this more aggressive person would be different. This aggression minded
member could really hurt things, getting more and more English majors
polarized against you and/or your PPL, etc. Again not only increasing
the real costs but also making agreements with other PPL's more
difficult to maintain.

I know this is a silly example but I'm trying to get to is a way of
showing that running a PPL might not be as straight forward as it
seems. In my co-op no one is allowed on the roof after 8pm, yet when
there are fireworks many use the roof and in general day in and day
out it is also used. It (the rule) is there not to stop be from using
the roof at 10pm but to prevent me from being a trouble maker on the
roof and the Co-op having no recourse. Likewise there are 100 other
rules that our part of our house rules, most of which are not enforced
unless someone complains.

Would PPL's be the same way? Lots of house rules? And how would PPLs
deal with differences in personality (e.g., aggressive and more
passive people or even better the ones who are very reasonable and the
ones that are not.)

Would PPL's have a internal Jury's.. (e.g., "mr Hawk we will you drop
from the PPL if you don't remove the 'kill all English majors' bumper
sticker from your car" vs some other PPL member w/ a bumper sticker
that might say, "English is a stupid way of speaking."

Ultimate we know there are many shades of grey and that people often
has little incentive to be reasonable and that it can even be hard to
agree on what is reasonable and what is not.

One last point: A Roman Catholic PPL with the Pope is charge and 100's
of years of written theology to backup and help direct the PPL might
have some strong advantages cost wise over a NEW PPL that ExI might
run. As an exercise try to think of the various advantages and
disadvantages an RC Church vs ExI PPL might have.

Thanks for you time,

Read Ridley ("The Red Queen"), his data are quite compelling.  Length of
generation is almost a direct correlation with sexual reproduction, and
the genes dealing with histocompatibility and immune response are those
with the greatest variation in the gene pool.

While it is true that the population of immune cells in your body itself
evolves to match the germs it finds, it is only able to do so because it
can recognize bugs that don't have all the right passwords; but it is not
possible to change the passwords themselves, because they are hard-wired
into your DNA, so eventually the bugs evolve to have the right ones.  Your
genes can only change the locks by producing offspring with scrambled DNA.
It's a fair gamble, 50% live long enough to breed, instead of 100% dying.

Just look at the lack of immune vigor in dangerously inbred species like
Cheetahs.  Cloning is the ultimate inbreeding.  No variation at all, no
chance for new combinations, no new locks on the old gate.  Every farmer
knows the same thing about his crops: once he finds a good hybrid, he
can asexually propogate it for a few years, but then it will succumb to
diseases, and he must rehybridize for new vigor.

Cloning for spare parts might help extend our brief lives a bit, but it
doesn't change the basic fact that we are designed by evolution to grow,
breed, and die.  To get past that, we need a new design entirely, not
based on cells vulnerable to viral and bacterial attack.

You referred to a theory that, within the context of a negotiation,
people will be more "entrenched" regarding big issues that little
issues.   Applied to politics, this might explain more confidence on
big issues relative to little issues, as long as those different
issues might appear in the same negotiation.  But if we compare
confidence regarding politics to confidence regarding phychotherapy,
where there is no common negotiation covering both areas, this theory
doesn't apply.

Why is it "non-trivial" to start a new paper?  Because the government
taxes a new business to death, requires license fees, minimum wage for
new workers, drives up the cost of supplies with regulation, creates
zoning laws to prevent you from putting the press in your garage, puts
strict regulations on banks to make it harder for them to lend you the
startup cash, passes anti-trust laws to prevent you and other papers
from colluding against the giant to beat him at his own game, and a
thousand other barriers to entry.  Sure, the big guy climbed that hill
too, but now he can look at you down there in the valley and laugh; the
government created the mountain, and once the first one climbs it, he
can use it to keep out competition.  Without the government, the playing
field stays level.

And who says you need a damned paper anyway?  Last time I looked, humans
needed food, water, and air.  If you don't like Murdoch, don't buy the
paper.  I get sick of hearing people whine about cable TV rates--I don't
own a TV.  I don't want one, I don't need one, I don't pay for it. 99% of
the things people complain about the price of are luxuries (with the rare
exceptions like the cost of rice in Japan).

The immune system of a clone will be entirely new.  The specific
immunities of a new child are developed in utero, not in the genome. 
There are too many possible antigens in the world for a 100mbp genome
like ours to program the immune system to deal with them.

It would take a few generations at least for cloning to become this
widespread.  After all, most people would want to wait and see how the
first generation grew up, and there'd be lots to learn about how to
deal with the situations cloning creates.  I think that by the time
this could have a big effect, upload clones will be possible.

On the ownership (copyright) to your genome:

Your parents composed your genome (unless you are one of those
newfangled clones, but then you'd be under a year old) from work
originally composed elsewhere.  Thus your parens don't own your genome,
and can't charge you royalties.  You don't own your own genome either.

In copyright law, it is not possible to own a fact, just the right to
copy a particular (newly created) representation of that fact. 

An you can't own a person copied from you DNA, because you can't own a
person period.

Besides, you didn't create your genome, so who are you to be claiming
credit for it anyway?

ON cloning a genius, artist, &c.

It is apparently possible to clone a good-looking person from a
good-looking person.  Studies indicate that physical appearance is the
prime determinant of success and happiness in human life.  (Height comes
into it for males, but intelligence and creativity are way down on the
list for everyone.)  This is probably the way to go.

Cloning a smart person, or a creative person will probably not work.  I
am a genius (defined by consistent 1 out of 10 000 or better scores on
intelligence/aptitude tests) and I know several others.  Everyone I know
in this category thinks just like everyone I know outside this category
(mostly 1 or 2 out of 100 intellects, I'll admit) .  Maybe they can hold
three or four more items in short term memory, but I suspect even that
is learned through experience.  The one common factor is personal
interest in and inner determination to study intellectual subjects.  The
environmental factors inspiring this are very consistent from family to
family.  So are the childhood stories we tell each other.

In conclusion, I think genius level intelligence and creativity are
learned behaviors.  It doesn't take a great genome.  And a great genome
probably doesn't help.

-Brian

But it's physical attractiveness that's really important anyway!

It is likely that agencies would pool some of their resources for
defense.  That would be part of their cost of service.  Free riders
are likely to be a very small problem: first, because "going armadillo",
i.e., not hiring a protection agency, leaves you vulnerable to all
kinds of mischief.  You can enjoy the barbed wire at the border for
free, but while you're doing that, some kid is stealing your stereo.
If the cost of protecting your property, and your right to enforce
contracts, and to redress torts is relatively small (as it would be
with competing agencies--even if it includes the cost of that barbed
wire fence and a missile silo or two), one is likely to pay it.
Secondly, private charities would probably include the cost of basic
protection with room and board, just as parents will pay for their
children's protection.

Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  It makes more
sense for agencies to contract with each other for arbitration than to
risk going to war.

Huh?  You think russian mafias are ideologues who would turn down a
chance to make a buck if it went against their religion?  Come on!
If they thought they could make a buck by sharing territory they
would.   And the expense of not buying protection from the only
available protection agency should be obvious.

Those of you interested in free market solutions should really look at the
Feb. '97 issue of Atlantic Monthly in which the cover article is "The
Capitalist Threat"  written by George Soros, one of the greatest, most
successful capitalists of all time.  

He says, "Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society today, it is
a belief in the magic of the marketplace.  The doctrine of laissez-faire
capitalism hold that the common good is best served by the uninhitited
pursuit of self-interrest.  Unless it is tempered by the recognition of a
common interest that ought to take preference over particular interests, our
present system--is liable to break down."

"By taking the conditions of supply and demand as given and declaring
government intervention the ultimate evel, laissez-faire ideology has
effectively banished income or wealth redistribution....The
laissez-faire-argument relies on the same tacit appeal to perfection as does
communism.  It claims that if redistribution causes inefficiencies and
distortions, the problems can be solved by eliminating redistribution...But
perfection is unattainable.  Wealth does accumulate in the hands of its
owners, and if there is no mechanism for redistribution, the inequities can
become intolerable."

The problem that I see with the market is that it is concerned only with
money.  People don't buy things, money does.  If you don't have money-- more
than half the people on the planet are outside the global economy--you get
no vote.  You don't count.  You are worse than a non-person, you are a
global liability.  Any system which reduces people to non-entities needs fixing.

Reciprocity agreements? I remember they used to have a problem with
private fire-insurance companies slugging it out with one another for
the right to put out a fire in an uninsured home, figuring they could
manage to collect something later. (Incidents like these were used in 
arguments for municipalization of the fire departments, or so I've
heard.) But it seems to me that reciprocity agreements worked out in
advance could narrow the problem down to the uninsured (or "outlaws").
Who would still present a problem in the situation you describe above.

But I think the best deterrent againt violent crime is having a
random distribution of 10% of the population trained and armed and
legally capable of defending themselves and their property. That
deterrent is presently being vigorously undermined in the United
States, and I doubt that either public law enforcement or PPA
contracts will do half as good a job.

Compare it to the system we have now. I've been attacked on the
street three times now in my life, and none of those times were
any public cops present. On one of those occasions I was assisted
by a private "Good Samaritan" who pulled up to the curb and frightened
away the muggers with his presence (ah, the power of a Fair Witness),
and never asked me for any payment. Just anecdotal evidence, but
I would be surprised if rigorous stats bore out the idea that public
cops actually perform much better than your worst-case scenarios
for PPAs. Of course, we don't have rigorous stats for  PPA performance
yet, just theory and a little bit of real-old Icelandic and
Anglo-Saxon history.

 >Or are protection agencies supposed to be location-based?

In my more moderate moods, I'm a Hayekian, and impressed by the
incredible tangle of externalities and public goods that develop
in a complex dense large city (such as San Francisco), and I'm not
all that averse to local governments contracting out for local
police services. (I still don't care for zoning decrees at *all*,
though.) The fact of the matter is that where I live, the problem
with law enforcement is not that it hasn't been fully privatized
and demonopolized, it's that they are wasting huge amounts of
resources on "vice" and traffic-stuff and not concentrating on
actual crime. Not to mention that the oppression of the persecution
for "vice" is one of the forces that turn people toward crime. It
makes the difference between a down-and-out person just turning to
drugs (bad outcome in a libertarian society) and a down-and-out
person turning to drugs *and* crime (bad outcome in my current
society).

So much for vice. As for the traffic-stuff, I think the streets and
roads should be privatized.

Unfortunately motor nerves are wired "live" like retinal nerves.  They have

Lots.  Hundreds of nerves, millions of individual cells.  Remember we can't

An interesting observation.  David Friedman also finds sports
spectatorship the best analogy with voting motivations.  The fun is to
take sides and make some team your "team".  I'm not sure why this
behavior happens either, but these two theories of politics also seem
plausible here:

I'm skeptical that that law enforcement enjoys such economies of scale.  To
judge from current practices in the rather polycentric US legal system,
entrepreneurs thrive at providing specialized legal systems (see, eg,
labor/management relations, ISP terms-of-service contracts, AAA, etc.)  Small
legal systems fit not only particular types of recurring problems (see, eg,
church councils that delve into the arcana of apostasy) but also particular
discrete populations that generate diverse problems (see, eg, private
communities).

At any rate, to the extent that law enforcement *does* enjoy economies of
scale, I'd not welcome anti-trust-like metalaws to prevent the practice.
 (I'm assuming consent-based jurisdiction, with freedom of entry and exit,

With regard to currently recognized co-equal legal jurisdictions, we look to
international law to settle such problems.  International law's customs and
agreements essentially constitute default rules and contracts, respectively,
for relations between sovereign legal systems.  The system does not work
perfectly, of course, but it works well enough to let little States such as
Andorra face off with big ones like France.  

Those of you who want models of how a polycentric legal system might resolve
cross-jurisdictional conflicts in general should look to international law.
 As theorists in the field have often noted, international law thrives in
"structural anarchy"; in other words, no one enforcement mechanism holds
sway, yet countries do not continually war.

I think it would be hard to over emphasize the importance of this new cloning 
development. The New York Times, not noted for their sensationalism, talked  
about cloning the dead. It would be interesting to talk to a clone of 
Einstein or Darwin or Newton or Shakespeare, they even mentioned a clone of 
Jesus, or at least, a  clone of the person who's blood is in relics and
claimed to be from Jesus.
 
There is also the question of somebody making a clone of you without your 
permission or even your knowledge. The Pope may thunder against the evils of 
it, but it would only take one fleck of papal dandruff to make a clone of the 
Pope. There are more down to earth medical applications too.

In the last few years Genetic Engineers have done some pretty impressive work, 
but almost entirely with single cell life, and the reason is that we could 
clone them, in fact that's the natural way this form of life reproduces. 
When you insert a gene into a cell it almost never finds its way to the 
correct place on the chromosome and gets expressed properly. It may take 
millions or billions of attempts before everything works, but if you also 
include a signaling gene for antibiotic resistance or for the production of 
a small amount of florescent dye, you can find the one successful cell out of 
billions and then clone it and make as  many as you want.

This didn't work for mammals because nobody had billions of fertilized egg  
cells to work with, so little Genetic Engineering was done on mammals. 
Now we can use any mammal cell, they're very easy to obtain and you can put 
millions of them in one small test tube. Find the one cell that expresses
the new gene correctly and then use it to clone an animal.

I predict that very soon somebody will insert human genes for the surface  
proteins of cells that the immune system uses for recognition into pig cells.  
They will find the one cell out of billions that correctly expresses these 
genes and then they will clone an animal. The result will be an animal who's 
organs work as well for transplantation into people as human organs do. 
The next step would be to engineer an animal for use by one specific 
individual, then a pig heart would work as well in you as one from your 
identical twin brother, if you had one.

It's a little more speculative but the womb such a pig that recognized human  
tissue as its own might be a good home for a human embryo for 9 months

Not really.  Ethically a clone is indistinguishable from an identical twin
carried by a different mother, which is already possible today.  The clone is
fully human in all ways, just as identical twins are today.

Raising brain-dead humans for replacement parts or cells is an ethical issue,
but whether the humans are clones or not is quite irrelevant to the ethics.
 The parts of clones are just easier to use for the cloned; that's all.

The question is what prevents someone from starting a new PPL which

with other PPLs, but doesn't contribute to this defense "pool".

It depends for me on just how bad things would get without such
metalaws.  I really do think we need a story about why Russian
protection agencies for example seem to form local territorial monopolies.

But International law deals primarily among local terrorial
monopolies.  I don't claim local PPLs would war with each other.  My
worry is that having many PPLs in the same local territory is
unstable.  Recognizing this fact, PPLs may quickly move to local
monopolies without firing a shot.  Competition would the be limited by
the costs to move from one area to another.  If these areas are small
enough, that could be a great improvement over our status quo, but
still different from the full PPL concept.

Three comments, in brief, appropos this old problem:

1) Excludability does not represent an essential quality; rather, it bears an
inverse relationship to cost.  In other words,  public goods change in the
face of changing technologies, with historical trends toward the
internalization of positive externalities. See, eg, broadcast-to-cable
transmissions.  I'm unwilling to claim that noone can whup the "national"
defense problem.

2) Among the probable social technologies for internalizing the benefits of
"national" defense in a polycentric legal order, I would count social
sanctions, with voluntary donations to defense efficiently tracked and tied
to a variety of services.  See, eg, the United Way's devices.  Another
appealling device, especially to large legal systems paying for defense:
 Peace.  (Permit me, if you will, a "duh.")

3) Robin rightly doubts predictions about the end-state of the end of States.
 Better to advocate jurisdiction based on express consent and let
entrepreneurs take a crack at such problems as national defense and
cross-jurisdictional conflicts.  See, Why Respect the Law? The Polycentric
Justification of Jurisdiction</EM>, in EXTRO 1: Proceedings of the First
Extropy Institute Conference on Transhumanist Thought, at 46 (1994).

Cloning pets- a new business opportunity.
High profit, low to medium overhead, fast set-up, no regulations.

Might see something like this fairly soon:

"Enclose a few cells from your dearly beloved pet in the vial, along 
with a description (cat, dog, etc.) of it and a picture. Send this to
our lab in Belize. Our courier will bring your new copy within a few 
weeks or months (depending on species). 20% extra for imprinted 
surrogate mother."

And later:

"New bodies for old pets!"

This type of business may fund the research on the other things. A 
wealthy person might easily drop a million on either of these 
prospects.
Btw, note that "Dolly" is at least several weeks old.

I'm not sure how much experimentation I'd put up with, especially
regarding an approach like this that I have strong doubts about.  The
downside to a failed experiment could be pretty drastic.

If there are substantial scale economies which can preserve large legal
systems even if they pay far more than their fair share of defense
costs, then likely they will pay most of the bill.   But with such
scale economies its not clear just how much legal diversity we'd have.

The other protection agencies.  If some agency doesn't pull its own
weight on national defense, the other agencies refuse to sign contracts
of cooperation with it, refuse to arbitrate disputes with it, and it
loses its ability to protect, and therefore its market.  Why belong to
a protection agency that is at war with your neighbors'?  You want to
hire the one that has a history of peaceful resolutions.

In the end, it all comes down to force.  You, and I, and every other
individual are personally responsible for our own lives and our own
safety.  Nothing magical will ever change that.  The best we can do is
to create systems that minimize the cost of that defense in terms of
money and in terms of lives.  But we can never ignore it, or pretend
that some "system" will make it go away.  Force of arms is necessary
for self-protection.  The question is, do we grant that force to a
single monopoly organization, or do we decentralize control of it, and
foster competition?

I repeat: Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  This
is a direct assertion of meaningful content, and I continue to believe
that it is true, and that is has real concrete consequences.  If the
fact that it "sounds like a slogan" in your ears (whatever that means)
makes you disbelieve it, that's not my problem.

Your concrete scenario is this: why couldn't a protection agency try to
manipulate the others into providing their services to it at no cost?
I repeat my answer: because theft has costs that trade does not.  It has
a direct cost in lack of ability to trade with others because of lack of
trust.  It has a direct cost in the willingness of others to use force
against you.   In short-run, low-risk situations like robbing a strange
house while the owner is away, it may be profitable; you'll never see
the owner again, you might not get caught, and you might successfully
fence the goods.  But in a public protection agency?  There's no way a
public entity can get away with dishonest trade for long without an
unaccountable monopoly government backing it up.

Hmm, according to Swedish law a collage can be copyrighted, even if it 
includes parts of copyrighted work. So if you define yourself to be an 
artwork (Automorph artwork), the at least in Sweden I think you could 
copyright your genome (I'll discuss it with a lawyer friend. Maybe I 
could do it).

Good point. Of course, using genetic engineering, surgery or cosmetics 
appearance can be enhanced too. So maybe we will see a future where some 
people clone beautiful people just to be safe, and others dare to compose 
new appearances. Hmm, there is a sf story in that...

That was worded badly.  The "immune system", if that is taken to mean
the population of antigens in the blood, does indeed develop after
conception.  The particular histocompatibility keys of affected tissue,
though, are genetic and fixed.  I should have said, then, that the bugs
evolve to adapt to your tissues, not to your immune system, which
adapts to them.  The effect is still there, though: inbred organisms
do not fight disease well.

Ug.  First be begins with an outright lie, then a strawman so plain it
should be obvious even to a politician.

(1) To test the "dominant belief in society today", it would be easy
  enough to do a simple poll.  Ask 10,000 randomly selected people
  which statement they most agree with:

  a) "The free market can solve problems like crime, poverty, defense..."
  b) "Government can solve problems like crime, poverty, defense..."

  Ask yourself which statement will get more agreement.  Without
  question, the latter.  So the "dominant belief" in society today is
  in government, not in the free market.

(2) Since he postulates that those who believe in the free market say
  that it will magically solve all problems, and they are clearly wrong,
  he asserts that government is superior.   First, he offers no evidence
  that capitalists actually believe that, or that the conditions he
  describes (like "inequality") are actually problems, or that the free
  market's failures are more or fewer than government's, only that it
  isn't perfect.  Well Duh.  Life's a bitch.  What else is new?

"Unless tempered by the recognition of common interest..."

That's the source of the problem right there.  If he postulates the
existence of a "common good", of course he'll come to the conclusion
that a system based on its complete rejection--capitalism--won't
achieve it.  Another winner of the "Duh" prize.  A screwdriver isn't
very good at setting nails.  Capitalism doesn't serve collectivist
ideals.  That's not the purpose of either, so of course they fail.

And to top it all off, he sneaks "our present system" into the last
sentence, as if to suggest that our present system is capitalist!
This is one of the most thoroughly despicable essays I've read in a
long time.

Now there are some real, practical, interesting applications.  I withdraw
my earlier comment about this cloning research being "unintersting".  Give
that man a cigar (and a research grant).

Why? Elizabeth I wasn't exactly a retiring housewife, and Eleanor of

Who was Sappho? I've heard her name mentioned a few times, but missed out

Isn't there a size problem? I seem to recall that in one of the HeeChee 
books by Pohl some people kept their embryos in carefully tended cows 
instead of themselves.

Don't worry, abortion was considered a horrendous and immoral idea for a
long time, but is now legal in almost every nation. Those that outlaw
cloning will simply create a market for high priced cloning in legal
jurisdictions. You'd think that people would learn from history.
Personally, I'd love to have  few more of me around to talk to.
Outlawing it will actually strengthen our hand, as we can get publicity
by filing lawsuits against restrictive governments, asylum in freindly
nations, and gain recongnition by Amnesty International as an opressed
political group.

Here's an interesting way to use cloning to discredit anti-abortionists:
if they are for life, they must be for cloning. Getting support from
womens groups would be a plus here.

This makes me want to go to medical school just to learn how to clone,
so I can start up a cloning clinic for fun and profit.....

It is not true that they hold this beleif. Libertarians beleive in
equality of opportunity, NOT equality of result. Libertarians beleive in
economic forces unleashed to allow natural selection to proceed
unimpeded to improve the human condition. THis is why libertarians tend
to be highly intelligent, educated, and average high incomes, as they
practice what they preach. THis unfortunately limits the growth of the
party, as the principles of libertarianism tend to disfavor those with
deficiencies which inhibit economic excellence.

I personally tend to think that children should be raised in equal
social circumstances, to allow as close to an equal level of opportunity
as possible, but once they reach whatever is considered "adulthood",
they live by TANSTAAFL.

As libertarian as I tend to be, I still have had enough personal
experience with people I call "trust fund babies" to consider huge
inheritances as a net evolutionary disadvantage.

This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth away
from people. Making everyone start at zero once they reach adulthood is
what I would call equality of opportunity, but redistributing the wealth
isn't, its penalizing success.

Just as present parents have joint rights to custody of their children,
and if they are dead, their relatives all have rights based on proximity
of relation.

Nope, each parent has shared biological rights to their children, and a
legal right to contribute any portion, whole or part to a reproductive
act.

I would say that the original has rights as a fraction in inverse
proportion to the number of generations removed that the new clone is.
Likewise, just as decendants of President Zachary Taylor had rights ( or
rather a responsibility to protect their heritage) as to the exhumation
of his body for an autopsy to determine actual cause of death,
decendants are responsible for safeguarding their genetic heritage.

I think that the only difference between current family rights and
future as impacted by the reality of cloning is that a clone will have a
100% heritage from one family rather than a partial heritage from each
parent. I think that reproductive rights need to be defined as a right
to one's genetic code. The more it is divvied up or decended from, the
more dilute the rights, but they are still there.

With unrestricted rights to bear arms, any agressor would face not only
automatic guerrilla warfare sapping his ability to continue agression,
but also open themselves to attack by unprovoked individuals and
collectives that share mutual defense agreements.

Agressive autocrats arise in political bodies that begin their agression
by restricting the right of the individual to bear arms. Note: one of
the first laws passed by Hitler's Third Reich was a broad gun control
law which in its verbiage was copied almost word for word by the
Democrats here in the US in the 50's for our own gun control laws. And
people wonder why the militia movement attracts so many gun activists...

Vinge himself wrote about the concept of individuals free to bear any
arms they can afford, people he called "armadillos" in _The Ungoverned_.

Exactly. Most of what we Americans, and many westerners call a "normal"
level of national defense is simply overkill. It is not defense, but
offense that it is most useful for. Limiting defense armaments to what
the average individual or collective can afford ensures the viability of
the geurrilla defense, due to a more equal weapon technology playing
field. Given equal weaponry levels, the battle always goes to the
defender in the end.

Dear Lee Daniel Crocker and  fellow extroprians,

I am new to this board, but have been reading about a week and I had to
respond to your clear thinking post.

Reading your response reminded me of the clarity of thought that I
experienced when reading Robert Ringer's "Restoring the American Dream" 10
years ago, or "Libertarianism in One Lesson" more recently.

The important thing for all of us to remember is that "UTOPIA IS *NOT* AN
OPTION! "

No such animal exists in human civililization, and probably never will. 

 But the overiding issue is the use of coercive force.  The free market trys
to "sell" you an idea  or an option for your life.  Governments, on the other
hand, use force, corersion, and guns to force your choice.  


Re:  "stability" of free market economies...

Stability of the buggy whip industry may have been a goal of a few
manufactuers of buggy whips, but technogy and  the free market has made this
particular brand of "stability" somewhat obsolete.  And of course, technology
changes everything virtually overnight. Should we mandate today's equivalent
of the buggy whip to "assure stability?"
  

Your requesting that terms like "fair"  and "perfect" be defined to expidite
genuine discussion is reasonable.  If you work twice as hard, smart, or
effectively as me and gain a substantial economic advantage over me, should I
consider this "fair"?

Of course, most of us with libertarian/ capitalistic/ extropian oriented
value systems would say, "Absolutely!" 

Those who define "fair" as systems that promote "equal levels of misery" as
we see in controlled economies would whine, "Not fair,  Crocker has
accumulated more chips than me.  Can't we pass a law to make him give some of
his chips to me?" 

So anyway, I can't express the libertarian ideals and ideas with the cogency
of Harry Browne, or Robert Ringer, or even, possibly Lee Crocker, but I
wanted to tell you that I value and respect the clarity of thought you have
provided.

 Warmly,

Rudi Hoffman

        I excluded nobility because women (as were men) were appointed and
conditioned to be noble.  In other words, they didn't have to risk their
careers or lives to be noble...it was taken for granted that they were of
noble blood (which was allegedly God-chosen).

        She was the first notable feminist in history.  Though I myself

of gender equality.  Needless to say, she was killed by men.

And how would you accomplish this, by taking away children from their
parents ? I think an equal chances education system (based on capacities,
not finances) is the best way to guarantee an equal starting position. And
yes, from there on i agree they're on their own... 

Human labor is the greatest resource we have on this planet. Educating that
human resource is going to multiply its value enormously. Making sure the
people with the capacity end up taking the right places in society, is
instrumental to the success of a system. A complete laissez faire system
will favor those with money, before those with the capacity. The problem is
here that emotions from the parents are involved, which go against the
rational theory of the free market solution. Education based on capacities
rather than based on the financial situation of the parents will avoid this
problem. A little extra financial backing from parents like tutoring,
summer schools etc is not a big problem i think. It's the big picture i'm
looking at. 

Problem is how to finance such an educational system without falling back
on state-like practices. Ideas anyone ? Auto-financing schools involving
child labor seems more than a little unethical ? However it's not such a
bad idea to pay children for good school results, it will make them get
used to the system they eventually get thrown into from the protective
situation they were in before. Maybe parents of children who perform good,
should pay less for education, and parents of children who perform bad
should pay more ? Again ethical problems arise..          
 
>Making everyone start at zero once they reach adulthood is what I >would
call equality of opportunity, but redistributing the wealth >isn't, its
penalizing success.

There's more to opportunity than just ones financial background. A great
deal of chance is involved. The product of ones genetical and environment
influences is highly subjected to that. Which is why i don't think starting
at zero would make that much of a difference. 

Again you're forgetting the emotional side here, Parents will help their
children, and why shouldn't they ? I'm not worried at all about  the extra
chances a financial situation of parents gives a kid, as long as the poor
kids get a chance to compete based on equal chances in education. (note not
equal education: equal chances)

Your suggestion still is sort of a redistribution of wealth (the starting
at zero), be it in a more limited version, it will be very difficult to
impose without touching individual freedom (that of the parents). Having
just an educational guarantee, is more scaled down, and will guarantee
survival systems almost as efficient. The problem is ofcourse who pays for
that education. I'm still looking at that one ;-)

Steve, Soros' comments are totally and utterly self-serving. Don't be
fooled!  He is doing what people who get to the top have always done:
trying to stay there by toadying to government.  Exactly the same things
were said by political businessmen towards the end of the 19th century,
and the support they gave to the concept of big government led to the
wonderful results we've had for most of this century.

This is the voice of mercantilism, not capitalism.  Given that
literature reflects opinion, just look at the very first thing he says,
then go to any bookshop in town and count the number of books, popular
and academic, that support laissez faire, then count the number of books
that support intervention.  Get the picture? 

He is, quite simply, lying through his teeth.  Why?  He wants to make
the state more powerful because, being rich, he is in a position to
influence a powerful state to do things to his advantage, to make him
richer.  It doesn't matter a damn to him what ideology the state upholds
- socialism, fascism, it's all the same, just so long as the state
becomes  a more powerful instrument *in itself*. If the USA were even
more fascist than it is he would be singing a fascist song and
critiquing laissez faire from a fascist (e.g. nationalistic) point of
view and you wouldn't hear a peep about the poor and the disadvantaged.
As it is, the present flavour is towards the left, so he falls in with
that.

You can bet your bottom dollar there wouldn't be very much re-distribution
of *his* money going on!

Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I was just shocked by the utter
cynical evil of what he was saying, and saddened by how you seemed to be
taken in.

It will make rapid production of new drugs by transgenic means easier. I'd
count that as useful. Sorry, I don't have the URL, but on today's Nando

Good point. But couldn't you get around that by infusing the "experienced"

This is one version of what some of us are calling the Linde
scenario. It is predicated upon the possibility of traversible
wormholes and baby universes. Most of what follows is science
fiction rather than technological extrapolation, in the sense 
that there's no rigorous argument that the step in question is
possible, but one has to start somewhere.

An updated version of this scenario will live at 
http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/infinite/linde.html

-mitch
"Wormholes are lunatic fringe technology" - Eugene Leitl


The Linde scenario, v0.01


The basic steps are:

1. Establish an industrial base in space
2. Manufacture wormholes
3. Spawn a baby universe and enter it
4. Tame that universe, spawn more from within it; repeat ad infinitum

In more detail:


1. Establish an industrial base in space.

I assume that this will be necessary for wormhole manufacture, which
may require very low gravity and/or very high energies that are
not available on Earth. Paths to industrializing space have been
described in many places, for example in Marshall Savage's book
_The Millennial Project_ (see http://www.millennial.org). 

Essentially this is a matter of locating space resources, reaching
them, and using them.


2. Manufacture wormholes

Here we jump straight into the science-fiction part. I am not aware
of a single reliable scheme for wormhole manufacture. One could
classify schemes as follows:

* Find naturally occurring macroscopic wormholes (e.g. cosmological
  remnants)
* Find naturally occurring microscopic wormholes (e.g. from 
  Planck-scale space-time fluctuations) and inflate them
* Artificially induce a topology change

The first scheme may require travel across light-years, if such
remnant wormholes exist at all; while the second may be problematic 
(it would seem to require the creation of an inflationary domain 
around the wormhole, and how would you get hold of it again having 
done that?). 

The third scheme, although in some ways the most speculative, strikes 
me as the most promising. String theory has already been used to
describe a form of topology change [Greene, Morrison, Strominger,
"Black Hole Condensation and the Unification of String Vacua",
hep-th/9504145], so perhaps we can imagine that in the 21st century, 
when the theory of quantum gravity is mature, we will be able to 
figure out how to induce such changes.

John Cramer once suggested (Analog, "The Alternate View", March 1996;
http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw77.html) that one could make a 
mini black hole with an asteroidal mass of rubidium, using Bose-Einstein
condensation, but according to John Baez (in correspondence) Fermi 
interactions among nucleons would interfere with this process. 
Nonetheless the general idea of making mini black holes using BECs 
might work for some other substrate.  Perhaps we can then imagine 
colliding mini black holes and looking for stable micro wormholes 
amongst the collision remnants. (This may sound a little arbitrary,
but I recall reading that the weak energy condition which would be
violated in the wormhole interior is also violated near the
event horizon of black holes. The search for a citation for this
is in progress!)

What would these wormholes be like? Let's assume that they're
spherical wormholes, whose throats are stabilized by exotic matter.
A single wormhole will look like two small balls of exotic matter,
but the inside of one ball is the outside of the other; in other
words, if you could drill into one ball, you would find your drill
emerging from the other. The region of exotic matter would therefore
have the topology of a thick-shelled hollow sphere (S^2 x I).

Having produced micro wormholes, one will want to catch them, store
them, and eventually manipulate them - move the ends around, make
them bigger, make them traversible. All of this depends on the
interactions of exotic matter with ordinary matter; if it has
electric charge or color (chromodynamic) charge, one may be able
to drag it around electromagnetically, store it in nucleonic cages,
and so on.

To make a spherical micro wormhole such as I've described 
traversible, it needs to be increased in size at least to nanometer
dimensions, and the shape of the exotic region needs to be changed
so that particles can get through. One might be able to make the
wormhole bigger by manufacturing exotic matter and dropping it in,
or by exciting the exotic matter that already holds the throat open.
As for a traversible wormhole, a donut shape (topology T^2 x I) 
might be a simple start. One could try to reach this by causing
the spherical exotic droplet to spin, becoming oblate, and then
by making a pole-to-pole hole in pancake-shaped droplet. 

So, the highly speculative procedure described thus far amounts to

* Make micro black holes
* Collide them and look for stable micro wormholes among the products
* Collect micro wormholes and store them
* Introduce energy to make the wormholes bigger, traversible, etc
* Ship them where needed (e.g. to the stars!)

The advantage of microscopic wormholes is that they can probably be
made to move very fast. Nature manages to produce 10^20 eV cosmic rays
[John Walker], which will cross millions of light-years in 30 minutes
"subjective time"; if one could send one end of a micro wormhole into 
space at such speeds, within 30 minutes one's home system would have
a wormhole connection to regions of space millions of light-years
away. One might circumnavigate a closed universe in days. This would
lead to the "wormhole empires" described by Michael Price 
[Michael Price, "Traversable Wormholes", Extropy #11; 
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Space-Time/wormholes.html].

Far-travelling wormholes also move far into the future, relative to 
the cosmological reference frame (in which the cosmic background 
radiation is at equilibrium), so this would be a way for people in 
the present to probe the far future of the universe. If our
universe is spatially closed (e.g. with topology S^3), the probing
of the future would be limited by the radius of the universe.
If one's wormhole network expands spherically, one can't send a probe
far beyond the "cosmic antipodes" (the point in space opposite the
network's point of origin) without risking the creation of
closed timelike curves and the likely destruction of one's wormhole
through the Visser effect (or some other chronology protection
mechanism).

Another spin-off of wormhole technology might be unusual rocket
designs, in which reaction mass was fed into the rocket via a
wormhole mounted in front of the engine, from remote stockpiles
of fuel.


3. Spawn a baby universe and enter it

An intriguing recent idea is that, rather than simply collapsing
into a singularity, the region of space constituting a black hole
pinches off from its parent spacetime and (upon reaching sufficient
density) inflates into a new universe. The idea behind step #3
of our plan is to shoot one end of a wormhole into a collapsing
supermassive object, in the hope that it will enter the future
inflationary region, avoid destruction, and survive into the
post-primeval era of the new universe.

I have already speculated that one might be able to make micro
black holes; I might further speculate that they are not very
suitable for the above procedure, because of their smallness 
and their brief lifespans. In that case, perhaps we need to
proceed as follows:

* Travel to a star on the edge of supernova
* Introduce very large numbers of caged pico wormholes into
  the star (when I say "caged wormhole" I imagine an atomic 
  nucleus inside which is one end of a wormhole)
* Position them so they will survive stellar implosion,
  inflation, and scattering in the new universe
* Wait for collapse... 

If everything works, you now have a wormhole link to a second 
universe.


4. Tame that universe, spawn more from within it; repeat ad infinitum

Presumably you don't want to wait millions or billions of years for
your new universe to cool, for stars to form, etc. So you open 
your transuniversal wormholes (i.e. make them traversible), ship
materials through, build relativistic rockets, cage your wormholes 
and put them inside, and then rocket the wormholes into the age
of stellar and planetary formation in short subjective time,
thanks to time dilation.

Now, if you want this whole universe under your control, you 
should construct and send wormhole-bearing probes into every
solar system. In supergiant systems, you can repeat steps #3 and #4.
Otherwise, you have a whole new universe in which to construct
megastructures, evolve ecosystems, explore spontaneously-occurring
natural phenomena like natively evolving civilizations, and so on.

I think that has always been one of the central problems in creating
a functional and just system of government.  Some important problems
will require specialized knowlege just to recognize them.  Free
markets are not effective at solving such problems.  The squeaky
wheel will get the grease, while another silently deteriorates until
it breaks.  Even worse, not everything that is good or desireable for
individuals or small groups will be good for the society as a whole. 
In these cases, free markets are worse than ineffective.  Please do
not ASS-U-ME that I am arguing that free markets are a bad thing. 
My point is only that they are not a viable solution to every
problem.

Recognizing this is easy enough.  But dealing with it is not.  I
doubt that it is possible to devise a system that can perform
optimally for every possible circumstance.  I think that the most
reasonable approach is a system that has ample provisions for
correcting itself so that the distinction between that which is
governed by pure market dynamics, and that which is governed by the
collective authority, can be adjusted either when circumstances
change or when previous decisions prove to be either
counterproductive or ineffective.  Most democratic governments
already attempt to acheive this kind of balance.  They have not been
completely successful in reaching this iedal, but they still have
performed better than most other systems.

The first part is easy.  It would be foolish not to admit that such
is the case.  But even with that, the second question remains a
difficult one.  Largely for the reason you mention below.

Point well taken.  Two points in response:

1) Legal systems do much, much more than merely patrol.  They legislate and
interpret and adjudicate and hector and . . . .  Moreover, very few Mafioso
claim the right to patrol *all* aspects of behavior.  The Mafia, famously,
co-exists with the Church.  Similarly, even if purely private legal systems
enjoy such economies of scale that they can effectively control particular
geographic areas, they will not necessarily quash legal diversity.  Examples
from current US law illuminate the point; statists claim exclusive authority
over the same behavior that concerns the Mafioso (and, note, do so rather
ineffectually), yet purely private and customary legal systems thrive.  And,
yes, these alternative systems do their own patrolling.  See, eg, any home
owner's association.

2) Why do we care so much who patrols, anyhow, so long as we enjoy diverse
sources of law and freedom of exit?  If monopoly scares you, you won't like
*any* aspect of the free market!  After all, my local 7-11 enjoys a natural
monopoly (and we've been using natural monopoly arguments here, you know)
over a several-block area, which will only support one such convenience
store.  In other words, what you call "monopoly" relies crucially on how you
define the relevant market.  

For what it's worth, I expect a polycentric legal order would give rise to a
mix of overlapping and exclusive legal systems.  The provision of criminal
law (tort, really) may well get bundled with private communities, and thus
apply uniformly to particular geographic locations.  Other types of laws (and
enforcement mechanisms) will probably not (eg, commercial law, church law,
etc.)

I think Lee meant the capacity of the immune system here, not its experience.

It is the same problem we face with life extension. As our lifespan
increases, our generation renewal ratio drops compared to that of the
germs. Germs will evolve and adapt more quickly than we do, added to the
fact that we already do less, and they do more so because of medical
improvements.

I'm responding to this thread half a day late, as always, being on the wrong
side of the planet.  So ten other people have probably made the same point
already.  But I had to add: not to mention telomere degradation in adult
cells.  Presumably poor little Dolly is some years closer to the Hayflick
limit than her woolly playmates, and will keel over earlier.  (Not that this
matter with lamb chops on the hoof.  But I wouldn't wish to be grafted into
a pre-aged clone.  So we'll have to retain our own embryo samples after all.
Um, not `we', a tad late for that - our kids.)

Unless I'm mistaken, that's `The Eyeflash Miracles' by Gene Wolfe (1976).
Yawn.  I've been grimly entertained by most media commentators (sorry Ravn)
making such remarks, including the scientist in the original news report who
told us he had this *great new sci fi idea* for cloning Jesus.  When Peter
Goldsworthy did this in HONK IF YOU ARE JESUS a few years, I thought it was
an *example* of cloning.  Sorry, team, it's all been done.  Gilbert Gosseyn
(Go-Sane) in van Vogt's Null-A novels was a clone with replacements lurking
in the tank back in the 1940s.  In 1973, Nancy Freedman cloned JFK in
JOSHUA, SON OF NONE.  Kate Wilhelm's WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG, the
classic clone novel, came out in 1976 (winning the Hugo award for year's
best sf novel) and canvassed most of the possibilities, as did Pam
Sargeant's CLONED LIVES the same year.  Varley is crawling with these plots,
and Egan carries them further.  Even a late-comer like Lois McMaster Bujold
has done it.  Her recent Miles Vorkosigan novel (the titles of these
Ruritanian entertainments drift away) used a nasty world where rich
dictators had bodies grown and exercised for later transplant.  The kids
were not decorticated (have you ever seen the kind of body that results from
microcephaly?), but trained with a kind of ideology/religion that made them
happily anticipate their merging with, for example, The Lady...  My point?
Not just justice to my fellow sf laborers in the fields, but a pointer to a
vast ream of elaborate material where many of the worst and best scenarios
have long since been amusingly explored.

I believe this is the method used in Poul Anderson's 1958 novel THE ENEMY

An equally irrational belief.  It is doubtful that you can show a
case in which a pure free market economy has actually improved the
human condition for more than few decades before producing a
condition in which the wealth becomes so severely imbalanced that
those who are not already amongst the wealthy elite have little
opportunity for advancement regardless of their ability or
willingness to work.  A situation that does not produce equality of 
opportunity, and that does not improve the human condition.

An op-amp circuit with strong positive feedback will tend not
towards balance, but to lockup in either an extreme positive or
extreme negative state.  Ungoverned free market economies also have
strong positive feedback, and share this same characteristic. 
Imagine each individual as an op-amp.  Those who are wealthy 
(positive) beyond a certain admittedly fuzzy threshold will tend to 
become more wealthy (extraordinary stupidity can change that, but 
I'm talking about a tendency, not an outcome that is certain in 
every case), while those below that threshold will tend to lose 
ground.  The further you are from either side of that threshold, the 
less likely it is that you can cross it by your intelligence and 
effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of crossing the threshold 
in the negative direction).

Your superiority complex is unimpressive.  I will be happy to discuss
and debate issues with you since you are intelligent enough to have
ideas worth thinking about, and to present an intellectual challenge
for those matters on which we disagree.  But I have no interest in
watching you stroke your ego.

Hmm...  That is an interesting idea.  I'm not sure whether I can 
agree with it or not.  It seems like something that would be a good 
thing if it could be made to happen, but might be extremely difficult 
to realize.  Perhaps you have thought of some way to bring this 
about?  Would this be an area where the traditional a-c opposition to 
welfare might be relaxed?

This gets back to that issue of equality of opportunity vs. equality 
of result.  I think we are in at least partial agreement on the 
concept, just not on how to achieve it.

Society does not owe anyone a living, but it does owe everyone an
opportunity to be productive and to be fairly rewarded for that
productivity.  Proposing the idea that society "owes" anyone
anything will probably ruffle some feathers, but consider:  There is 
little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not for the 
benefit of the members of that society.  I construct machines to be 
my slaves, not to be enslaved by them.  The same should be true of
anything we construct.

Then perhaps we are not as much in disagreement as it might appear
on the surface.  I simply propose that such problems are too often
glossed over, and that avoiding such issues cannot come to any
productive end.

My point was only that free markets produce beneficial results when 
they start with a reasonably flat distribution of wealth. I do not 
propose that it would be beneficial to force them into that 
condition.

However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in
every possible case.  If an economy becomes so imbalanced that one
man owns everything, do the rest of us simply starve to death?   Such 
a situation would most likely be corrected by a violent revolution.  
Probably well before it became that extreme.  So when should the 
killing start?  20% with 80% of the wealth?  10% with 90%?  1% with 
99%?  One guy with everything?

Economic polarization cannot go indefinately without some kind of 
corrective measure.  If not by application of law, then by collapse 
into depression or by violence.  But by some means it will end.  Just 
like the op-amp with positive feedback, extreme polarization is the 
natural tendency of a pure free market economy.  Then it destroys 
itself and everything must start all over. An endless oscillation 
that starts by building up from nothing, a period of prosperity with 
a large middle class, a period of increasing polarization and 
increasing unrest, then collapse into depression (or bloody 
revolution) and it all begins again.

This is my model of what would happen with an economy that has zero
governmental regulation.  I am not accusing the rich of being evil. 
The victors don't have to be monsters (though there is no reason
they can't be).  It does not require any criminal wrong doing.  No
one has to be forced or deceived into making a spending decision. 
Just successful business practices carried to their ultimate
conclusion.  The inevitable outcome of any successful implementation
of the anarcho-capitalistic ideal.  Maybe I'm wrong. I'm sure many
will disagree with my model.  I doubt that there is any historical
precedent that can confirm or disprove since such a system will
likely not complete a single cycle of the oscillation without being
altered in some way during the period of unrest (i.e. government
regulation and/or introduction of some element of socialism) making
it impossible to fully isolate the cause even if it does follow
through to a revolution or a collapse into a depression. Many would
blame the increasing governmental regulation for the collapse.  I
tend more to blame the impending collapse for the increasing
government regulation.  Last resort measures in an attempt to save a
sinking ship.  I'd be happy to hear any alternative models you might
want to offer. And any reasons that you think my model is wrong or
that some other one is more accurate.

This reminds me of an interesting idea that was proposed as a thought 
experiment by a man I used to work with.  Put aside your distaste for 
taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100% 
post-mortem tax, but no other.  It all goes to the state when you 
die.  Attempts to cheat the system by giving substantial gifts will 
result in having the tax applied early, effectively pressing the 
reset button on your life.  You are entitled to keep and enjoy 
whatever you rightfully earn (outright theft and fraud would still be 
illegal) within your own life, but are entitled to nothing that was 
earned by anyone else regardless of relation, except perhaps that the 
revenue from the post-mortem tax might be used to provide education 
prior to going out on your own, and perhaps a few other public 
services that would have to stay entirely within budget.

I realize that the possibility of extended lifespans screws up this 
scenario, but it is interesting to think about none the less.

                                        Peace,

He never claimed that anyone believes the marketplace can solve 
all problems, nor even that they believe that it can solve even one 
of the problems you use as an example, nor even that inequity is 
a problem except when taken to extremes.  In your attempt to show 
that the quoted author had presented a straw man fallacy, you 
presented a textbook example yourself.

That the author committed a straw man fallacy is logically
unsupportable within the context of the information that was given
in the original post.  He was perhaps given to a bit of
exaggeration, (Libertarians may not see government intervention as
the "ultimate" evil) but I think that claiming this as evidence of a
straw man fallacy would be reaching.  However, that you committed a
straw man fallacy is logically irrefutable.  No additional
information required.

Have you allowed your emotional attachment to your beliefs interfere
with your ability to reason?

You are picking nits and evading the real issue.  He did not claim 
that it is 100% capitalist.  But it is more capitalistic than 
anything else, so to apply a single word to it without having to 
state percentages or produce some otherwise unecessarily belabored 
qualification, "capitalist" is a reasonably accurate description.  If 
you find rational argument to be so "dispicable", then perhaps you 
need to be offended more often.

 But where are the benefits to the candidate? I doubt there are a
lot of elections where the expected salary exceeds the cost of getting
a majority of voters to remember the candidates name (except for
small town governments where the politicians aren't a separate enough
class for their interests to diverge from the voters enough for the
random democracy to matter).

 However, you are clearly right that there isn't any passionate
demand for random democracy, which is somewhat contrary to what
you suggest in the "Confidence: A Basic Politics Puzzle" thread.
Indeed, it is hard enough to imagine an average person holding
a strong opinion on random democracy, and I suspect the absence
of selfish motives for supporting random democracy has something
to do with this.

 Good question. Why isn't this used for the kinds of promises politicians
are making now? There appears to be plenty of demand for the benefits
it would provide, and I can't see any obstacles that deter its use.

And, in fact, Soros has redistributed a lot of his own money, mostly in sort

Actually, anencephalic babies are occasionally born, even now.  Fortunately,
they die within a few days.  Apparently brains are necessary for further
development.

He claims precisely that; he just doesn't have the balls to say it
in plain English, but leaves it as the implication of evasive rhetoric
that would make a spin doctor proud.  If he means something different,
I can't fathom it.  Perhaps I am seeing meanings that aren't there,
or I am over-reaching because of the insidiously evil ideas he then
spouts, but I think not.  I think he really means to imply exactly what
I think he implies, and his words are meant to attack that implication
because he can't attack the facts.

Yes, I do get emotional about this particular subject, because this
man, others like him, and his ideas are the most serious danger to my
life and liberty imaginable.  He is a liar, a coward, a rich hypocrite
who wants to keep others from having the success he has achieved by
manipulating the collectivist government to use its guns to keep them
down now that he's got his.  I would not allow this man into my house,
or sit at a table with him.  Reading his words fills me with moral
revulsion.  Is that emotional enough?

I try to maintain some semblance of reason under these conditions, but
I'm not perfect.

I read about half of his book, and found his philosophy as
unimpressive as his market knowledge was sophisticated.
Not an unusual thing - when somebody makes a career in one
field, and then teaches people in others.
Still, I had an impression that his philosophy was sincere;
he really tries to improve things.  Which doesn't necessarily
mean that he should be supported, as his views on what is good
for the world may be mixed with the desire to keep himself in
control of the developments, and this is exactly the combination
that created the worst villains in history out of people who
viewed themselves as do-gooders.
  I doubt that Soros would surrender the control of his funds
to a group of people who may understand global social matters
better.
 I don't know that much about him though.

 Recently, I read an excellent review of Soros's ideas and
activities, and problems of his organization in Telepolis -

It was not a complete description.  I make no appologies for that
since covering all the bases would have turned a paragraph into a
documentary.  To do so was not necessary to the point I was making. I
simply mentioned the aspects of Libertarian belief that I happened to 
be addressing.  There is much more to Libertarian ideology, and free 
markets are governed by many interacting forces.  I suspect that most 
people reading this thread don't need to have either of those things 
explained to them.  If I say that a car is red, that does not mean 
that "red" is the entirety of my understanding about the car.  If you 
are not capable of mentally fleshing out the details enough to 
prevent imagining that I have "bizarre ideas about what a free market 
is", then that is your deficiency, not mine.

By "stable" I only mean that it remains productive, as opposed to
grinding to a halt or exploding in a conflict.  I did not mean to 
imply that it is unchanging.

"Highest correlation of effort with reward" is something I would 
include in the definition of "fair".  Might also add some degree of 
equality of opportunity.

Lack of coercion is a desireable ideal, but it is not the feature
that makes free markets successful. It is the promise of reaping some
reward in return for your productivity.  Without a reasonable
correlation of effort with reward, and without a reasonable
opportunity for success, then the incentive to produce disappears.
Without those two elements, you are left with something that is no
more productive than pure socialism.  Perhaps even worse since even
coercion is more effective than no incentive at all.

Are you arguing that these ideas, whether you include them in the
definition of "fair" or not, are not an integral part of the
Libertian ideal of a free market economy?  It is because of these
elements that capitilism has enjoyed such success.

Good example.  I'm sure further research would reveal others.  But my
point was simply that there are potential scenarios by which a free
market economy can produce less than optimal, or even
counterproductive results (like inferior products, high prices,
survival of the fattist instead of the fittest, etc.)  I'm not
arguing that such things happen in every possible case.  Are you 
arguing that they don't happen at all?

I haven't mentioned monopolies and wasn't planning to.  If I happen 
accross a good example I'll be sure to mention it.  For now you seem 
to be arguing with yourself.

I really don't mind sincere requests for clarification, but this
isn't it and I'll use any words I damn well please.  I could pester
you to define the words that you have used.  Words like "justified",
"detriment" and "moral".  We could go back and forth for weeks
nitpicking over minutia.  But it would serve no useful purpose.   If 
my ideas had been too vaguely described for you to understand them, I 
doubt they would have grabbed your attention enough for you to take 
the time to reply at such length.

Ok.  I think I can understand that.  I don't agree with your
argument but at least I can gather that your argument was not a
deliberate misrepresentation, but rather based on what you percieve
his intended meaning to be (as opposed to the literal words).

Since my name is still in here, (for some mysterious reason that evades me,
as there are no quotes by me anymore), i'll jump in.

Which is why equal chances in education are so important. And which is also
why a zero starting position like Michael Suggests may not work, and where
a starting situation that lies on that fuzzy treshold might. Problem is you
can't accomplish something like that without redistributing wealth. Young
adults have no wealth, and are therefore all by definition under that
level. Taking money away from their parents is an option, but what the hell
is the justification for such a system ?

Topping off the results of peoples efforts, is the single most damaging
thing to motivation for productivity increase today. (Mind you that I'm
very much on the wrong side of that financial threshold myself, as i'm
still young)

In Europe exactly those social measures that where intended to redistribute
wealth, are seriously hurting the effective social mobility. Young people
who want to start businesses face a similar threshold, but one created by
obligatory social and healthcare insurances, value added tax, and income
tax which results in a bankruptcy ratio of two out of three the first year.

>Would this be an area where the traditional a-c opposition to

Social security was intended to be a 'catching net' for people who fall
through the mazes of the system, it has completely lost that function.
Money should be spent on re-educating people, helping people help
themselves, not on keeping the pressure off the stability of the political
system. This is Populism instead of social feeling.

Seeing the benefit that any productive individual contributes to the rest
of us, i view the loss of such an individual and his possible contribution,
as a loss to society. On that basis i feel the rest of us should feel
'responsible' to some degree for that individuals chances for success.

Besides providing education, theres the ethical question of not letting
people starve to death, which i feel is a moral responsability, but it
shouldn't go much further than food and shelter. (i'm not quite out of the
medication part, as illness is not societies fault in any way, should it be
it's moral responsability ? I like to think it is, but i haven't found a
justification for it yet) 

If such a vision (that of the responsability for chances of success) is not
shared, then why do we have children ? what is the reason to continue the
human race ? Or is this maybe exactly why some of us seek life extension ?
To rather be a big fish that owns the small ocean it lives in forever, than
a little fish owning just part of the big ocean ? In other words: what is
more important ? The more rapid growth of ones personal property or the
(even) more rapid growth of the ocean ?
   
>> This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth
>> away from people. 

Exactly. In cases where market solutions cannot be found, we should at
least *consider* auto-financing ones (non profit, but cost-covering)
Non-profit, auto-financing institutions are doing very well in free market
systems, and are subjected to the same rules of that free market. Moreover,
anything one can come up with against them, based on unfair competition
etc, severely limits the individuals choice not to make profit. It could be
the perfect alternative to adapt altruistic or human/emotional tendencies
to rational, market based systems. 

The fact that this option is so undervalued here, doesn't surprise me, but
i can't help but be negative about the fact that so little effort has been
made to find alternatives and second options. Dogmatism or extreme future
optimism ?, the second is to be respected, but the boundries can be vague
sometimes...

I'm still very positive that a system can be found that avoids such
(dangerous) imbalances, without the need for redistributing wealth. And
maybe even without the need for a state, and definitely without one that
the individuals (are forced to) pay for. 

One of the positive characteristics of a free market is that it would
boost economic growth enourmously, and the effects of even a growing
imbalance, would diminish greatly. The way i see it conditions for this are
a guaranteed coninued economic growth, population growth (educated) , and
(continued) human expansion beyond it's current habitat (space- colonialism
?). One flaw in the system that halts this (like a limit ?), and the walls
come crumbling down though. That's when we need the alternatives you (and
i) proposed, or preferably built in security measures that deal effectively
(and coordinated, but exclusively for this) with crisis situations.     

>Put aside your distaste for 
>taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100%

I proposed it myself a few weeks back (in the thread that lead to a thread,
that lead to this one), toyed with the idea, allthough not as radically as
you have. And came to this conclusion:

1) Why should the individuals power over his worldly posessions or his
property end at death ? The individual is the one that aquired it,
shouldn't he be the one to decide what happens to it ? 

One great thing about extropianism and transhumanist movements is that it
tends to reject the powers nature (and all other) holds over the
individual. Should it not be a beautiful thing for that rejection to
include the loss of the power over ones property at death ? 

2) Extropianism pursues eternal life and life extension, viewed not only in
this light, but also in the light of an ever increasing population growth,
the system you propose would be like throwing water on a hot plate. 

Allthough i do not agree that everything proposed (yet) for a free market
system will work, i have come to the realization that any solutions for
problems left unanswered, must come from, or be adapted to the same
background, the same set of ideas and laws, that are inherent to the
theory, as much as possible, in order for it to work.

Finding solutions, and proposing to implement them in ways that directly
oppose the basis of such a system, has been my initial (and  occasionally
still repeated) error as well.

I think, we can discuss in principle about gradual uploading to the human
clone possibilities.
What would be hapened, if we wouldn't let normal evolution of clone, but
would connect his brain with parent person brain via interface ?
If this inerfasc would be sufficiently powerful, we could believe of common
work of these two brains and some uploading phenomenones as I have wrote in

http://www.alepf.se/Trans/Global/Uploading/guploads.html

I will not touch upon a ethical questions now, but the technologicaly
possibilities seems debated.

I highly recommend a new video "HIV=AIDS...Fact or Fraud?".  It is available
for $24.95 from Starvision Productions at 800-608-4330.  I have no financial
interest in this project.  It it almost 2 hours in length and deals with
just about all of the problems with HIV, the virus the government says
causes AIDS.  It is well produced, and features interviews with Dr. Peter
Duesberg, the leading HIV=AIDS dissident, and others.  If anyone else sends
for this, please e-mail me with your comments after viewing.  Thanks.

We already have a model for an Anarcho-Capitalist defense system for petty
crime, property theft, and murder.  That system is the master-planned
community with an elected city government.  It protects the community well,
keeps the police responsible to the protectees, and benefits from full
economies of scale as everybody on the street is a protectee.

Democracy has a lot of problems for determining nationwide retirement systems
and drug regulation.  But remember modern American democracy evolved from
town governance systems and it's just fine for that.  Police takeovers aren't
too much of a problem with that system, and there are defenses against that
with resident police and an armed citizenry.  In an anarchic system no doubt
there would be insurance for renegade police as well; but that's a backup
defense, just as the main line of defense against fire is a fireproof roof,
fire extinguishers, and a sprinkler system, not the fire insurance company.

Shopping malls and office centers will provide protection acceptably too, of
course, as safety is an essential part of what they sell.  No safety, no
sales; mafioso protection, no sales either.  No need for democratic controls
there.

This case illustrates some of the strength & weakness of sf.  Yes, sf
authors have considered these subjects in some depth, and their
writings contain many insights worth attending to.  But these insights
are not very well summarized and commented on.

In other intellectual areas, people write review articles and books,
and textbooks, to summarize and critique the insights so far.  In sf,
these insights are left scattered among hundreds of long novels,
novels mostly devoted to plot and (sometimes) character development.

It would be a great service if someone could write academic quality
summaries of the insights into the future contained in the existing sf
literature.  One article per topic, such as cloning, would be fine.

Two theories come to mind:
1.  Voters really don't want to elect a leader whose hands are tied in
this manner.  They know these promises are just cheap talk, they don't
take them any more seriously than that, and that's they way they like it.
2.  Being the first to make a promise like this would flag you as
someone who thinks we won't trust you, and as someone with an ususual
fascination and trust in monetary incentives.  Looks too weird.

I think the problem is not the lack of such material (secondary 
literature on SciFi exists), rather lack of interest on side of the 
readers. One could post such essays to usenet newsgroups, like.

Do you or do you not have a Democrat as president?  Is it or is it not
extremely likely that the Labour party will be elected to office in the
UK at the next general election?  Of course these left wing parties have
been influenced by libertarian economic ideas: as has the right, for the
past 15 years or so!  (However, this is not an ideological commitment
>from either side, as Soros would have it, but a practical economic
necessity, grudgingly and shamefacedly admitted to, except by some
enthusiastic Republicans and Tories.) However, the Democrats do not
subscribe to the nationalistic/moralistic (fascist) fervour of the
Republicans, nor does Labour do the equivalent in the UK.

These are still left-wing parties. I would also really urge you to try
that book shop experiment. Really, there are very few books in bookshops
and libraries that support laissez faire; laissez faire is considered a
crankish ideology by most intellectuals, and has been since the 19th
century.  So I ask you again: why would somebody lie about that?

OK, but judging by his statements, I would look very carefully at his
'redistribution'.  I would be willing to bet that most of it is likely to
have been to his own advantage; probably a lot of it has gone to support 
*government* schemes in Eastern Europe.  If I am wrong, then I retract
what I say about his being consciously evil: he would be just a
well-meaning but misguided fool.

I'm all for brevity; I use it (perhaps too much) myself. If I
misinterpret your elided meaning, please clarify.  But what I think
you are referring to is the very common perception of libertarian
ideology that we have naive faith that free markets solve lots of
human problems and makes everyone peaceful and prosperous--in short,
the L. Neil Smith fantasy world.  It is my contention that very few
of the libertarians I know are like that.  Most are more accepting
of many present systems, wanting to change things in the free market
direction where they feel it is needed.  Some, like me, hold moral
positions that the free market is a necessity, but even we don't
think it will be without problems.  We just believe problems in a
free market are created by reality rather than by the state.  I
recognize reality's right to create problems for me; I make no such
grant to any state.

Even that limited definition fails for all systems, including the
free market.  Booms and busts are a natural consequence of supply and
demand; accidents, disasters, blind-luck discoveries, and other events
happen all the time that would destabilize /any/ system.  I happen to
think a free market will handle such conditions deftly and quickly.

I agree completely (except for your words "desirable ideal"; I would
use "necessary precondition").  It would be "better" in the sense of
more productive and fair, in your terms, if there were a higher
correlation of effort and reward.  I cannot, however, conceive of
how that is possible to achieve without constraining and controlling
every human in the system and choking all creativity.  The fact is,
random events will occur.  Rich brats will inherit their productive
father's estates and squander them.  Bums will win lotteries.  Which
scientist makes a critical discovery is more a matter of chance than
either the scientist or Rand would like to admit.  These are just the
facts of reality, and trying to change them is like arguing about
what value of pi would be "best".

This I have to disagree with completely.  Yes, the free market does
not ensure a perfect correlation between productivity and reward.
No system possibly can.  But it /does/ achieve more than enough of a
match to be incredibly productive, and far more than any socialist
system could.

Some people's ideals maybe.  I think most are more realistic than
that.  Maybe not.  Maybe they really do believe the L. Neil Smith
nonsense.  But not the ones I know.

You ask me to recognize that there are "problems" with capitalism
that libertarian ideology doesn't deal with.  That's two claims: 
(1) Capitalism has problems, and (2) Libertarians don't deal with
them.  The first I concede: yes, capitalism has precisely those
problems that the nature of human life and reality have--but without
those additional ones created by states.  The second might be true,
but I think it may be an impression left by the fact that the most
vocal libertarians tend to be the most evangelical, and don't like

Hello everyone,

2 million British children suffer from the effects of malnutrition. A 
British study ("The Hunger within") shows that this is mainly a 
consequence of the cancellation of state subvention. This is another 
step to a more and more liberated economy (less state intervention) -- 
and those children, yeah, at least now they can freely decide if they 
want to eat or not! The only thing that surprises me is that so many 
decide not to eat. Stupid children.

Next step: Children should get the right to freely decide whether they 
want to quit school and to work in the heavy industry! Best starting age 
is probably at the age of 9 or 10, when they're young and ready to 
learn. Yeah, British economy, they know how to do it -- one of the 
highest economic growth rates in Europe! 

And we can solve the problem with those poor families, too -- we simply 
strike out public welfare, and the problem solves itself! And anyone who 
dies from hunger or gets ill or both is of course guilty himself! Had he 
done as much as he could -- he would have survived. Wouldn't he? 

To those of you who haven't already noticed: Yeah, I'm a cynic.

Erik

O.K., you guys have helped me update my default image of
anarcho-capitalism.  So let me think out loud:

We start with large states as we have now, with a "monopoly of force"
within their area, who primarily choose laws to cover interactions
between their citizens, but who also negotiate laws to cover
interactions, including travel, between their citizens and those of
other states.  These laws are largely chosen via centralized political
processes, but sometimes they consider the possibility that
disatisfied citizens will move elsewhere.

Then we imagine shrinking these territorial entities, ending perhaps
with urban towers or planned suburbs.  Each entity is likely still a
"state" in the sense of holding a monopoly on local "force", i.e.,
fighting professionals who patrol and are ready to respond to calls
for help.  But ease of moving between entities and of creating new
such entities keeps entities competitive and hence accountable, by
switching attention from voting with "voice" to voting with "feet".
And the change in scale switches the legal focus to law regarding
interactions between citizens of differing entities, rather than
between citizens of the same entity.

As entity scale decreases, competition should bite first regarding
laws of people and things which are the most mobile and interactions
that most easily cross entity boundaries.  Mobile capital should be
respected early, as well as trade across porous borders, while
protecting people with high moving costs against domestic violence on
may happen late.  And with sufficient competitive pressures on a legal
issue, territorial entities may be willing to let this issue be
taken over by non-territorial entities.

Given this picture, I see two contrary stability concerns:

TOO LITTLE COORDINATION -- These diverse entities may suffer severe
free rider problems regarding "public" goods such as national defense.
Hopefully donations, social pressure, and the self-interest of large
entities would be enough to get by.  But if coordination comes by
refusing to do business with entities that won't contribute, that may
be enough coordination to create the next problem:

TOO MUCH COORDINATION -- In some times and places, such small local
monopolies of force seem to have agreed to leave each other alone to
prey on their "citizens".  Coordination may allow them to punish
deviant entities which treat their people nicely and take in refugees.
We need to better understand why this happens so we can work to
prevent it.

"George Soros, Positivist in a Poke"
  by Carl Jahnes  2/2/97

Now comes George Soros, investor extrordinaire, with his view on  "The
Capitalist Threat" in the February '97 issue of "The Atlantic".

Soros says that when a "system" seeks to become "absolute truth," it then
feels that it must compel those who don't buy into its postulates... it
feels it must compel them to "be free," or to do the actions it defines are
in everyones' best interests... it must force them to do the acts it
defines as the good life.  He rather says that we must come to a belief in
the fallibility of ALL systems (and I think he is talking about political
"ideologies").  He says (and all quoted lines are from the article, pp. 55
& 58):

  "All cultures and religions offer such standards (criteria of truth); the
open society cannot do without them.  The innovation in an open society is
that whereas most cultures and religions regard their own values as
absolute, an open society, which is aware of many cultures and religions,
must regard its own shared values as a matter of debate and choice."

Soros is falling for the old siren song of Positivism.  He refuses to see
his own axiom which he places 'beyond' the "...matter of debate and
choice," and that is, that "An Open Society is the type of society we
should have."  Or to state it another way, "An Open Society is the Best
Society."  He does not see that he must place this 'beyond' debate, in
order to maintain the conditions FOR debate, which allows Openness of
debate to prevail!  Continuing...

  "To make the debate possible, there must be general agreement on at least
one point: that an open society is a desirable form of social organization.
 People must be free to think and act, subject only to limits imposed by
the common interests."

But aren't "common interests" debated in an "open society"?

  "The D of I may be taken as a pretty good approximation of the principles
of an open society, but instead of claiming that those principles are
self-evident, we ought to say that they are consistent with our
fallibility.  Could the recognition of our imperfect understanding serve to
establish the open society as a desirable form of social organization?  I
believe it could, although there are formidable difficulties in the way. 
We must promote a belief in our own fallibility to the status that we
normally confer on a belief in ultimate truth."

There are problems with this analysis.  If our "axiom," that "An Open
Society is Best," proceeds from us, then it is a product of our
"fallibility."  Later, (and I'll quote it) Soros betrays his
Utilitarianism.  

  "But if ultimate truth is not attainable, how can we accept our
fallibility as ultimate truth?

  "This is an apparent paradox, but it can be resolved.  The first
proposition, that our understanding is imperfect, is consistent with the
second proposition; that we must accept the first proposition as an article
of faith."

Voila!

  "The need for articles of faith arises exactly because our understanding
is imperfect.  If we enjoyed perfect knowledge, there would be no need for
beliefs.  But to accept this line of reasoning requires a profound change
in the role that we accord our beliefs."

  "Historically, beliefs have served to justify rules of conduct. 
Fallibility ought to foster a different attitude.  Beliefs ought to shape
our lives, not to make us abide by a given set of rules."

This is so convoluted that I have to stop.  Soros' reasoning is not
penetrating the wet paper bag he's in!  To say, "if we enjoyed perfect
knowledge, there would be no need for beliefs," is ridiculous.  I believe
that 2 + 2 = 4, because it is true that 2 + 2 = 4.  Soros is thinking that
in a perfect world, there would be no "freedom" to choose falsehood, rather
than the truth.  This itself, is a "belief," and is an axiom he has placed
in front of his so-called reasoning which is beyond "...debate and choice."

He also says, "...Beliefs have served to justify rules of conduct" and that
 "Beliefs ought to shape our lives, not to make us abide by a given set of
rules."  Well, if our lives have "shape" and have "form," if they are
ordered according to the axiomatic faith that "An Open Society is Best,"
then our conduct which serves to support the existence of this "shape of
life" could be abstracted into "rules."  For there would be some
"character" to our lives, which we call "shape," which could be described
so that we understand what this shape "is."  Like describing the "shape" of
a table to understand why it is not "a wheel."  And so, if beliefs "shape"
our lives, the acts which make up this shape, in that they conform to the
axiom which asserts what the "good shape" of society "is," are "rules." 
Let Soros continue to thrash...

  "If we recognize that our beliefs are expressions of our choices, not of
ultimate truth,  we are more likely to tolerate other beliefs and revise
our own in the light of our experiences.  But that is not how most people
treat their beliefs.  They tend to identify their beliefs with ultimate
truth.  Indeed, that identification often serves to define their own
identity.  If their experience of living in an open society obliges them to
gvie up their claim to ultimate truth, they feel a sense of loss."

Well, it *would* be a loss, because to accept the axiom that "An Open
Society Is Best," is the same sort of faith - belief - that a religious
person exercises in HIS object of faith.  Soros is trying to make "the Open
Society" self-evident in the way Positivists do, by assuming its truth and
not recognizing that this "truth" is an assumption which must, if it is to
find "form" and "shape" in lives, must be identified AS a subset of
"Ultimate Truth," and must be protected by an Institution, which PUTS its
ultimate truth beyond debate.

Soros thinks that if we accept our "fallibility" on faith, then this can
"ground" the Open Society, can "protect" it magically, because by placing
our relentless urge to find where Truth is Unified, where it is Ultimate,
beyond debate, it must logically follow that Society Must Be Open To All
Opinions, To All Debate, To All Choice.  But this is fallacious.  If we are
'fallible,' then the axiom that "Society Must Be Open... blah, blah" is
ALSO fallible, and does not necessarily follow any less than its opposite,
"Society Must Be Closed....blah, blah."  Let me just keep typing Soros, so
you get the gist...

  "The idea that we somehow embody the ultimate truth..."

Why "embody"?  All we were doing before was "believing" it!  

  "is deeply ingrained in our thinking.  We may be endowed with critical
faculties, but we are inseparably tied to ourselves.  We may have
discovered truth and morality, but, above all, we must represent our
interests and our selves.  Therefore, if there are such things as truth and
justice..."

Remember, in an "Open Society," the existence of truth and justice are
matters of debate and choice...

  "and we have come to believe that there are - then we want to be in
possession of them.  We demand truth from religion, and recently, from
science.  A belief in our fallibility is a poor substitute.  It is a highly
sophisticated concept, much more difficult to work with than more primitive
beliefs, such as my country (or my company or my family) right or wrong."

  "If the idea of our fallibility is so hard to take, what makes it so
appealing?  The most powerful argument in its favor is to be found in the
results it produces."

Here's the Utilitarianism.

  "Open societies tend to be more prosperous, more innovative, more
stimulating than closed ones.  But there is a danger in proposing success
as the sole basis for holding a belief, because if my theory of reflexivity
is valid...."

He's defined "reflexivity" as "feedback which helps create course
corrections."  The Open Society allows this to happen, of course!

  "being successful is not identical with being right.  In natural science,
theories have to be right... for them to work....  But in the social sphere
what is effective is not necessarily identical with what is right, because
of the reflexive connection between thinking and reality.  As I hinted
earlier, the cult of success can become a source of instability in an open
society, because it can undermine our sense of right and wrong."

Apparently there is "much more" which is a matter of "belief" in this Open
Society (right and wrong).

  "That is what is happening in our society today.  Our sense of right and
wrong is endangered by our preoccupation with success, as measured by
money.  Anything goes, as long as you can get away with it."  

Skipping a paragraph, and continuing...

  "The concept of the open society needs to be more firmly grounded.  There
has to be a commitment to the open society because it is the right form of
social organization.  Such a commitment is hard to come by."

INDEED!  For, according to Soros, it "must" be what it cannot be,
Ultimately True that the Open Society is Best!  Soros is left to his own
feeble "belief statements," as we see, continuing...

  "I believe in the open society because it allows us to develop our
potential better than a social system that claims to be in the possession
of ultimate truth."

Yawning contradiction!  

  "...Accepting the unattainable character of truth offers a better
prospect for freedom and prosperity than denying it.  But I recognize a
problem here; I am sufficiently committed to the pursuit of truth to find
the case for the open society convincing, but I am not sure that other
people will share my point of view.  Given the reflexive connection between
thinking and reality, truth is not indispensable for success.  It may be
possible to attain specific objectives by twisting or denying the truth,
and people may be more interested in obtaining their specific objectives
than in attaining truth.  Only at the highest level of abstraction, when we
consider the whole meaning of life, does truth take on paramount
importance."

Yawning blind spot.  If it is not 'true' that *Open Society Is Best*, and
if there does not exist an Institution to protect and defend this Truth, to
put it "beyond debate," "beyond choice," "beyond attack," then, one can
"choose" the closed society, and that "choice" is just as valid as its
opposite.

  "Even then, deception may be preferable to the truth, because life
entails death and death is difficult to accept.  Indeed, one could argue
that the open society is the best form of society for making the most of
life, whereas the closed society is the form best suited to the acceptance
of death.  In the ultimate analysis a belief in an open society is a matter
of choice, not of logical necessity!"

O Yawning Blind Spot!

 "That is not all.  Even if the concept of the open society were
universally accepted, that would not be sufficient to ensure that freedom
and prosperity would prevail.  The open society merely provides a framework
within which different views about social and political issues can be
reconciled; it does not offer a firm view on social goals.  If it did, it
would not be an open society."

Yawning contradiction!  "If an Open Society does not allow for the "choice"
to be made which would transform this Open Society into a Closed Society,
then it is Not An Open Society."

  "This means that people must hold other beliefs in addition to their
belief in the open society.  Only in a closed society does the concept of
an open society provide a sufficient basis for political action; in an open
society it is not enough to be a democrat; one must be a liberal democrat
of a social democrat or a Christian democrat or some other kind of
democrat.  A shared belief in the open society is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for freedom and prosperity and all the good things
that the open society is supposed to bring."

Yes, "...necessary, but not sufficient condition," the *necessary and
sufficient* condition is the reasoning which "proves" that it is True that
the Open Society is Best, such that it can be "defended."

  "It can be seen that the concept of the open society is a seemingly
inexhaustible source of difficulties.  That is to be expected.  After all,
the open society is based upon a recognition of our fallibility.  Indeed it
stands to reason that our ideal of the open society is unattainable.  To
have a blueprint for it would be self contradictory.  That does not mean we
should not strive for it.  In science also, ultimate truth is
unattainable." 

Soros can't see his own contradictions.  Would he call it a "blueprint" for
the Open Society to be defended from becoming a Closed Society by the very
conditions of "debate" and "choice" it allows?  Would he call it a
"blueprint" for the Open Society to be grounded in an article of "faith"
that "We are Fallible"?  If we feel we are fallible, then, it supposedly
stands to reason that debate should never be closed off, in the sense that
its products become Ultimate Truth... but then, wouldn't the statement that
"We are Fallible" ITSELF be fallible?  Why should it be believed over any
other statement?

The Open Society *itself* is an article of faith.  My opinion is that the
Open Society is a Product of Christendom.  Why?  The answer is theological,
and reasonable.  If God does not "force" us to believe in Him, if He gives
us freedom, TRUE freedom to accept Him or reject Him, then we should accord
no less freedom to our neighbor than He does.  If this is "truth" inherent
in Reality, because God intended it to be this way, then it is a matter of
"virtue" that we preserve the kind of social conditions in which this
Freedom can take "shape," and can "be real."  Therefore, it is Good that
the Open Society Exist, and that it continue to exist when choices are made
to 'close' it.  For no man knows the mind of God, and if you buy what God
says about you and me, our fallibility ALSO is established, and so Openness
serves as a "defense" against our falliblity.  And, there must be an
Institution which can "defend" and "fight for" this Openness, when choices
are made, in the name of Openness, to Close it off.

Yours in laying bare attacks on Western Civilization, Carl.

-----

P.S.  For my own part, I see Soros as having bought into the nonsensical
political correctness slowly poisoning our academic institutions of higher
learning; Allan Bloom's phrase springs to mind, "openness to closedness." 
The Open Society is defenseless to those who would openly choose to close
it, the monoculturalists who masquerade as multiculturalists.  The one
culture that prevails in an undefended Open Society of Soros' fantasy, is
the culture of death.

Shirking?  Granted, we have yet to flesh out the transition from a statist to
a polycentric legal order, but I would not assume that statists will entirely
rue the change.  Rather, they may, given the proper incentives, cede power
gracefully.  See the "buy outs" of ex-Soviet Communist Party members, or US
Federal Judges retiring early for the more lucrative practice of ADR.
 Needless to say, I regard crafting effective (if not necessarily
Pareto-optimal) exits to a polycentric society as a *very* important and
interesting topic.

Careful here.  Recall that enforcement in one geographic area can come from
different legal systems at different levels.  Again, the
far-from-perfect-but-not-entirely-rotten US legal system provides good
examples:  fed and state cops patrolling the same highways; bounty hunters
crossing the country; the SPA busting software pirates everywhere--even
online.

And--importantly!--voting with money!  I may well pay more for a coop that
has increased its police force.  I may well pay more for an ISP that promises
me infection-free access, backed by bond.

Maybe.  But some communities will undoubtedly turn inward and primarily
adjudicate their own struggles.  Cf. how States currently evince different
levels of interest in foreign policy.

I'm surprised Lamarckianism hasn't come up on these threads (unless I 
missed it....).  Lamarckianism, the idea that someone can pass along 
characteristics acquired in their lifetime to their offspring, has 
never been proven by its proponents, yet it forms the basis for some 
of the paranoid sensationalism surrounding the sheep cloning.  
Rational statements debunking Lamarckianism are already being shouted 
down by neo-Luddites who would rather trade in fear to further their 
causes.

If one wanted to clone a body for spare parts, and wanted to avoid 
the humanist ethical dilemna, would it not be more reasonable to 
refine the method sufficiently to enable persons to clone specific 
organs or limbs?  One could freeze samples of the major organs, and 
other areas of concern based on genetic testing, and then grow 
replacement parts using equipment that would be small enough to be 
managed by local clinics.  It certainly would seem a more 
cost-effective method than growing an entire human and finding a 
place to store the rest of the body.

And gullible too.  What actual evidence (you say nothing but "A
British Study") do you have that those children are malnourished
because of lack of government intervention, and what assumptions
were made in that study?

Secondly, it does not surprise me that a people with a long
history of opposition to individual rights and responsibility
would look at malnourished children and blame the state, rather
than those actually responsible for the chilren: parents.  Why
do you not look at this as a moral problem, rather than as a
political one?  Are there no /people/ in the UK willing to take
on the responsibility for these children's care that their
parents have shirked?  And if there are such people, is the
government getting in the way of their doing it?

You can usually still view this diversity as mostly under the control
of some dominant level, either a small entity which has joined a
federation but can leave at will, or a large entity which delegates
some tasks to a provincial administration.

Certainly it would be more efficient to grow organs and limbs you need,
but we don't know how to do that.  We're closer to being able to clone a
body.  And then again, such things take time -- why not clone the entire
body and have spares instantly accessible for whatever you need?

Of course it'd be really more efficient to genofix ourselves to
regenerate limbs naturally.

I'm no neurophysiologist, but isn't the brain required to sustain

have to have something in its place to take care of these activities.
Also, the muscles will atrophy if they are not used, again, something

The problem here is that the state has spent so long nursing and
nannying people that they are unprepared for the responsibility of doing
it themselves. This is made worse by virtue of it being a withdrawal of
previously extant income. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most
species have mechanisms to adapt to lean times? If food is short,
reproduction decreases; smaller broods and less of them. It is
unfortunate that these people find themselves in a situation of sudden
deprivation, their reproductive decisions (conscious or not) were made
based on an energy supply of x. They now find themselves with x/2.
Result? A problem. Our particularly long nurturing period (inception to
the point where the offspring can sustain itself to a significant degree
- artificially inflated in todays western society) doesn't help. Most
species would suffer perhaps a year, perhaps less, of hungry offspring
and more mouths to feed than there was food to go around. We're not so
lucky, with perhaps 15 years to get through.

These families have my sympathy, and if people I knew (friends, family,
neighbours) found themselves in this situation I might be prepared to
help out financially if I could, but that is a decision only *I* can
make. I cannot make it for the guy down the road who's in gainful
employment paying taxes to support someone elses children when he has
trouble keep a roof over the heads of his own family. You may not be
aware of it but in the current welfare structure in Britain it can be
financially advantageous *not* to work (I expect to take a *lot* of
flack for that one 8). 

So what do you propose? To perpetuate a problem? To treat the symptoms
instead of the disease? That's like using a sticking plaster to cover a
gaping wound. It's unsustainable and it's unfair and IMHO it should
never have happened. Unfortunately it did and there's nothing we can do
to change that. We *can* try to make things better for the future
though. I'm not saying that the welfare system is being dismantled in
the kindest manner possible, or even the most rational, but I back the
*principle* wholeheartedly.

Right. Time to don the Kevlar and await the inevitable.

That's reasonably close to my intended meaning.  I would alter it
only to add a belief that free markets will inevitably yield good
results without any kind of adjustment outside of what occurs
naturally within the market itself.  Most are aware that  free
markets have some tendency to be self-correcting.  But it appears
from much of the discussion here that some have expanded this into a
belief that free markets will be self-correcting in all possible
scenarios, and that they have no inherent failure modes.

In that case, I may well have been mistaken.  At least about the
views of some Libertarians even if not all.  Perhaps the real
disagreement here is not about what will make an economic system
function properly, but about what the proper function of an economic
system should be.

It seems to me that the proper function of an economic system is to 
solve some of those problems (the ones that the nature of human life 
and reality have) rather than just reflecting them on a larger scale.

That thought has occurred to me.

The same research showed it was because they choose to eat at macdonalds
instead of eat a carefully balanced diet. I heared that Labour already
passed a law that should forbid everyone under 18 to eat fast food. The
same law will take steps to make every motorist pass a monthly test
checking vitamin levels. The extra tax on cars goes to taking on special
'vitamin guards' who will patrol near junk food outlets and arcade parks,
spotting suspicious looking pimples.

I heard they went on hunger strike because they found out they were not
allowed their daily macdonalds any longer. Tax decrease on cigarettes was
another of their demands. Smart kids.

Have you seen Unimation/Westinghouse new UK slogan for marketing their new
SCARA robot arms ?: 'A kid can operate our robot arm',

They even changed the name to SKARA: Smart Kid Assembly Robot Arm

Possibly a good thing in view of recent predictions that soon kids this age
will be the ONLY ones able to operate mechatronics.

Wouldn't he? 

Why yes, ofcourse they're stupid. They could have just popped over to the
macdonalds, where both types of stock are now rotting away. I hear the
'vitamin guards' don't bother you too much when you have no money. Some say
they even become friendly to you...

That's true, I can't show you such a case, nor can I show you a pure free                          
market economy, the contagion of nationalism has spread to every square inch

A wonderful theory, but like all theories it must be compatible with the
facts. Let's Look at the corporate giants of 25 years ago. A & P  was by
far the largest retailer on planet earth, today I think they still exist
someplace but I wouldn't swear to it. Where is Eastern Airlines or Pan
American or Control Data or Studebaker or Packard? It sounds ridiculous now,
but just a few years ago many said that IBM should be prevented from entering
the PC market because it would completely dominate it. Many of the giants of
today like Microsoft, Walmart, Intel, Digital, Sun or Turner Broadcasting
were tiny or non existent 25 years ago.  On the other hand we have the same
damn governments we had 25 years ago and, in the USA at least, government
controls a much larger percentage of the economy than it did then.

Government, however minimal it starts off to be, will grow because it has
advantages that no other power center has. A corporation, no matter how big,
can not force you to consume their product and then pay for it, nor can a
corporation force you to work for it. On the other hand, if government needs
labor to serve on a jury or fight a war it makes no difference if you want
to work for them or not, you must. If you don't want the services the
government provides, you still must pay for them. The government will make
you an offer you can't refuse, otherwise men with automatic weapons will come
to your house knock on your door and drag you away.


        >There is little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not 
        >for the benefit of the members of that society. I construct machines 
        >to be my slaves, not to be enslaved by them. The same should be true 
        >of anything we construct. 
                 

Nobody understands themselves so they sure as hell don't understand the
economy in which they live well enough to construct it to specifications.
Imagine trying to calculate the price of an object from first principles,
it would be like writing a book on auto repair using only the equations
of Quantum Mechanics! Fortunately the market will tell you what the price
is real quick.


        >However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in
        >every possible case.  


I agree. Taking wealth away from other people and giving it to me is very
acceptable, I find that everybody basically agrees with me about this, except
they do want to make one modification. Personally I think that change destroys
the beauty if of my original plan.
               

        >Economic polarization cannot go indefinately without some kind of 
        >corrective measure.  
                      

And you expect government to provide that corrective measure? It's crazy to
think government will be on the side of the weak, making friends with
the powerless and making enemies of the powerful is no way for a politician
to stay in power.
                

        >This is my model of what would happen with an economy that has zero
        >governmental regulation.  


Whenever there is talk about deregulating a section of the economy the loudest
howls of protest come from the leaders of the industry being regulated.
The regulation is there to stamp out competition and preserve the status quo,
despite some wonderful rhetoric it has nothing to do with helping the weak.
                             
                
        >"Highest correlation of effort with reward" is something I would

Effort is irrelevant. If would take enormous effort to learn to play the
piano with you feet, but if you want to do it then go right ahead, however
I feel not the slightest pang of guilt in not personally rewarding you for
it.             
               
        >Some important problems will require specialized knowlege just to

True.        
                    
        >Free markets are not effective at solving such problems.  


What are you talking about? Companies hire thousands of people with very
specialized knowledge, and unlike government specialists, they are held
accountable when their theories prove to be wrong.
                
I think the trouble in all this is that you're comparing the Free Market as
it actually exists, warts and all, against a saintly omniscient government
that ALWAYS knows what the right thing to do is, and even more important,
ALWAYS has the moral courage to do it. It's not very surprising that the
market comes out second best in such a mythical contest.
                               

        >What I proposed was lowering the price to a level that would not
        >allow you to compete and still remain profitable. I would lose money,
        >but would not willingly incur any greater losses than were necessary.


The lower you set the price of widgets the greater will be the demand for
them, the greater the demand the more widgets you must manufacture, the
more you manufacture the more money you lose. I don't care how much money
you have, if it is finite, this sequence can only end one way. 
               

        >In the proposed scenario, I am the one with the vast resources.


And you are assuming that my resources are close to zero, if so that means
that very little money is needed to get into the widget business so even if
you get rid of me a thousand new competitors will soon spring up. If it takes
a lot of money to make widgets then my financial resources must be
significant.
               

        >Even if you buy them from me you still have to market and distribute
        >them.


True, but the beauty is that every widget I buy from you makes you weaker, 
and you are my competition.

I have to ask, do you really think this is a good way to make money, would
you use your hard earned savings to buy stock in a corporation that tried to
corner a market in this manner? If so I'd like to talk to you about investing
in my perpetual motion machine company.

recent replies suggest the possibility of your posting relying on facts.

I assumed you posting was exaggerated and i have never witnessed any
indications for possible malnutricion caused by poverty in the uk myself. 

The only indications of true poverty i have witnessed there were crack
related, and go a few years back. I usually stay in london in the east end
with friends that are like me: not wealthy. However it has been some time
since i last been there.

2 million seemed a also little steep

however if your post is based on fact, i apologize for my tasteless reply.

Steve, Soros' comments are totally and utterly self-serving. Don't be
fooled!  He is doing what people who get to the top have always done:
trying to stay there by toadying to government.  Exactly the same things
were said by political businessmen towards the end of the 19th century,
and the support they gave to the concept of big government led to the
wonderful results we've had for most of this century.

This is the voice of mercantilism, not capitalism.  Given that
literature reflects opinion, just look at the very first thing he says,
then go to any bookshop in town and count the number of books, popular
and academic, that support laissez faire, then count the number of books
that support intervention.  Get the picture?=20

He is, quite simply, lying through his teeth.  Why?  He wants to make
the state more powerful because, being rich, he is in a position to
influence a powerful state to do things to his advantage, to make him
richer.  It doesn't matter a damn to him what ideology the state upholds
- socialism, fascism, it's all the same, just so long as the state
becomes  a more powerful instrument *in itself*. If the USA were even
more fascist than it is he would be singing a fascist song and
critiquing laissez faire from a fascist (e.g. nationalistic) point of
view and you wouldn't hear a peep about the poor and the disadvantaged.
As it is, the present flavour is towards the left, so he falls in with
that.

You can bet your bottom dollar there wouldn't be very much =
re-distribution
of *his* money going on!

Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I was just shocked by the utter
cynical evil of what he was saying, and saddened by how you seemed to be
taken in.

Guru George

Erik Moeller reports--
	2 million British children suffer from the effects of malnutrition.
	A British study ("The Hunger within") shows that this is mainly a
	consequence of the cancellation of state subvention.

The main trouble is that the British can't cook.

Unlike you I am not a cynic, but I am a skeptic, and I know that in the USA  
those on welfare are more likely to be grossly obese than malnourished. 
I am even more skeptical that your mysterious "study" has have the source of  
this phenomena, but for the sake of argument let's assume it's 100% correct. 

Can we conclude from this that it's a terrible situation to have 2 million 
hungry children? 
Yes! Very definitely.

Can we conclude from this that government is good?
Obviously not, we have government and 2 million hungry children too.

Why aren't these hungry children being helped?
Because nobody really wants to help them.

Will ANYTHING, government, the church, the market, men from Mars, give 
charity to these children if nobody wants to help them?
No.

I know you're trying to be sarcastic, but I thing that would be a very good 
idea, provided that two questionable ideas you imply in your post are true. 
1) 2 million children in Briton are near death due to starvation. 
2) Nobody will give them charity.

Child labor is not evil, grinding poverty that makes it necessary is what's 
evil.

National defense is a valid issue for an anarchical society.  City-state
cultures, which create an environment similar in many ways to that of a
hypothetical anarchy, do have problems with national defense.  To be fair,
the problems are not overwhelming - the city-state cultures of ancient
Greece, Renaissance Italy, and early modern Germany fell to foreign conquest;
but they all lasted a long time, and more conventional states get conquered
too.

I'm not aware of any other externalities that city-state systems, and by
extension a more modern polycentric anarchy, don't handle.  Past ones have
dealt with some really thorny ones like water rights and maritime law.

This is why I think democratic city government plus an armed populace is a
good way to handle basic personal security.  When the community provides its
own protection, predatory government is rare.  Modern police forces are both
accountable to their communites and lack the force to control the entire
population; this is an ideal situation for watching the watchmen.  You could
probably figure out ways for commercial security organization to be
well-controlled, but why bother?

Tomorrow morning I'll be interviewed by Canadian TV on extropian views on
the cloning breakthrough. The show is Big Life on CBC and will be shown in
Canada on Friday. (Feedback from Canada-based extropians very welcome.)

I want to make a number of points, placing the cloning breakthrough in a
broader context. In case I'm missing anything important that should be
squeezed into my air time, I'm soliciting suggestions here. I intend to put
cloning in the context of a broader growth of our ability to modify our own
biology, and to make the political point that choices about cloning should
be an individual matter, not a governmental policy. I will also suggest
that the implications of cloning (even humans) is not particularly dramatic
(though it is a sign of accelerated progress) since genetic engineering and
other bio-modifications will be more radical.

I also gave Wired News a quote and may do a longer story with them, so I
can make good use of any clever suggestions that might help spread our ways
of thinking to the public.

(I should note that CBC is specifically interested in the extropian context
and not simply narrow comment on the cloning thing itself. It seems that
Extropian thinking is becoming recognized and that media people are
beginning to solicit our views as a recognized group or school of thought.
This is progress!)

Onward!

All it takes for some behavior to seem too weird is for there to be
some population of people who you'd rather not deal with who exhibit
this behavior.  The behavior itself can be most anything.

Take the example of physics "cranks".  Physics profs regularly receive
unsolicited manuscripts from people without academic credential or
affiliations, which make claims that would be earth-shattering if
true, which don't much attempt to put their work in the context of
current research, and which non-standard notation and tools, and which
seem to have pretty sloppy reasoning.

Since the vast majority of such manuscripts turn out to be pure junk
on a closer analysis, most physics profs won't bother to read anything
that meets this pattern.  They will even ignore stuff that matches a
small fraction of this pattern.  Yes, they could be rejecting the next
Einstien, but they don't have time to read all this stuff carefully.

Similarly in politics, most people perceive that there is an army of
ideologues who "know" that adding monetary incentives always makes
anything better, and who are gung ho to, with very little thought or
analysis, reccommend adding them to most any context.  Most people
(rationally) fear the consequences of appointing these ideologues as
politicians, and so rationally avoid a politician who behaved as
they expected these ideologues to behave, as long as they expected few
other types of politicians to also behave this way.

This comparison is too simplistic: bionomics is a better model than 
electronics for describing the economy because markets, corporations 
and individuals are complex adaptive systems composed of intelligent

Bill adds:

that is certain in every case), while those below that threshold will 
tend to lose ground.  The further you are from either side of that 
threshold, the less likely it is that you can cross it by your 
intelligence and effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of 
crossing the threshold in the negative direction).>

Economic analysis does not support this conclusion, at least not in 
the relatively open markets of the U.S.  Throughout most of last year, 
the predominantly statist press in the U.S. had been crying about 
rising income inequalities.  Of course, as the presidential election 
approached, the story shifted - things weren't really as bad as 
everyone thought - so that Bill Clinton could claim major progress at 
eliminating these 'inequities' during his first term.

In the 01/25/96 Wall Street Journal, Karl Zinsmeister of the American 
Enterprise Institute wrote about this in an article called "Last 
Hurrah For Class Warriors" and noted:
<... the figures on cash earnings that are regularly trumpeted by 
economic declinists completely ignore the doubling since the early 
1970s of worker compensation taken in the form of fringe benefits. The 
increase in noncash income is even sharper on the governmental side, 
where every year, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of health 
care, food stamps and housing transfers - which didn't exist in 1970 - 
are pumped into the economy, unacknowledged in the national income 
statistics. Erroneous comparisons of demographic apples to oranges are 
another common mistake of those who use weak official income figures 
to grind their programmatic axes. When tracing median income over 
time, you must be sure you are looking at the same kind of 
household.... Families have become considerably smaller, for instance. 
The average family had 12% fewer members in 1993 than in 1970. And a 
smaller family with the same income is actually richer. When you 
correct the income statistics for family make-up, you find that 
average incomes are clearly up since the early 1970s, not down.>

Also from last year's Wall Street Journal, an editorial on 04/17/96 
noted how liberal "anxiety scenarists present the U.S. as a static 
caste society" but a new Dallas Federal Reserve Bank report by Michael 
Cox & Richard Alm "looked at income mobility for Americans over 17 
years" and found:
<By 1991, only 5% who had been in the bottom quintile 16 years before 
were still there ... Of folks in the middle quintile in 1971, a full 
80% were at the same level or higher 16 years later ... And what of 
those at the ladder's bottom? Messrs. Cox & Alm looked at their 
spending patterns over the century ... In 1920, the bottom quintile of 
earners consumed 70% of their income on necessities such as food, 
clothing and shelter. That fell to 57% by 1950, and 45% these days.>

I recall a number of other articles noting similar results; in 
particular, longitudinal studies showing how easy it was for the 
wealthy to lose their wealth and slip into lower income categories. 
 Of course there are *a few* ultra wealthy who would have to be 
awfully generous or stupid to lose their wealth.

In short, this 'fuzzy threshold' you talk about is fuzzy only because 
it is so huge and, at least in the U.S., is liquid enough to cover the 
vast bulk of the population.

Mark Crosby

P.S. The problem with this thread is the assumption in the title that 
it's possible for any system to "solve everything" and the even worse 
assumption that the stagnation of 'balance' is desirable.

What do you mean by "city"?  My impression is that in large urban U.S.
inner cities, the police is not very accountable to the local
citizens, who are in fact largely armed.  Here there does seem to be
scope for substantial improvement by having a more local "subcity"
police with laws and enforcement chosen by locals to be tuned to local
circumstances.

On of the things that has NOT come up at all about cloning yoruself (
everyone is being very pragmatic and clinical)  is how we will REACT to
seeingour own DNA as a child, or all grown up and walking around. 
It is easy to talk of growing clones to extend our lifespan ( as if they were
radishes) but parents have been known to throw themselves in front of trains
to save their children, who carry *similar*  DNA.. do you suppose you might
feel a bit of this kind of altruism and protective instinct, seeing your own
DNA, born ( I assume a clone must have surrogate mothering- imagine if you
were it's mother, or your mate had carried it to term) and raised?
Would we take pride, watching it growing up and thriving?

I would agree.  A city needs to be fairly small for the government and its
agents to be "us", even in a democracy.  I think 50,000 - 100,000 seems to be
the upper limit.  I haven't personally analyzed the exact numbers, but the
current planned communities going up around here (Orange County, CA)
generally plan for about 50,000, so I figure that's a good number.  Modern
metropoli of 1 Meg or more are certainly too big.

Inner cities have additional problems, in that they often have weak civil
societies and business communities.  No, I don't have any pat answers for
these kinds of problems; in the absence of an outside state I see
difficulties in their creating either a functional traditional community
police or a "police-for-hire" situation.  The situation there with an
external state supposedly enforcing laws is pretty gruesome as well.

I wondered about this too, but I haven't seen any details.  A great deal
of reproduction is necessary during growth, since you are starting with
a tiny little egg and ending up with a great big animal.  I would have
thought that the Hayflick limit, if it is a factor here, would have
interfered with the development process.  I wonder if the details of
the procedure involve somehow resetting the telomeres or providing new
ones, so that the donor DNA can make a fresh start.

Sure its a copy but a bad one.. 

or

It look like me but it NOT....

If I had cancer and I wasn't sure ALcor et al will work.. it might
want to "buy" a clone and leave him a piece of my estate...

but if I wanted to leave a legacy I, PERSONALLY, speaking would rather
leave money to soeone with the same MEME's rather than the same
GENE's.

e.g., rather leave money to a young and like minded Extropian than a
newborn clone (or even adult clone) who might not see eye to eye,
might be highly competitive w/ me or resentful of me, etc.

Why would we expect anything different or unusual?  We already know how
parents treat children, and how identical twins treat each other, so I
would expect to treat my clone in some combination of those ways.  I
think it would be more likely to expect parental behavior, because even
though he's actually my twin brother rather than my son, all of the
sensory input he gives me will be child-like, not twin-like.  I have no
reason to have evolved any emotional reactions to clones, but I have
very definitely evolved reactions to my children--i.e., little creatures
that look like me (this one more than usual) and that depend on me.

Having first said that cloning would be "uninteresting", I must now
concede that the medical uses will be numerous.  But I maintain that
there really is no social issue at all.  A child is a child is a child.
Your first sentence states the problem right off: you refer to "seeing
yourself".  It's /not/ yourself, it's a kid.  A completely ordinary,
crying, spitting, diaper-filling kid.  And from the first moment after
conception when hormone levels in the womb in which his zygote develops
are different from those of the womb in which I developed--even if we
go to the extreme measure of using my mother as the surrogate--his
development diverges from mine, and never looks back.

I'd like to think that my little brother wouldn't develop into a
serial killer, or that we might share some interests or values, but
all I can probably count on is that he'll be tall, fair-skinned, bald,
and have green eyes.  Beyond that, I'll probably hate the music he
listens to just as much as my father hated mine.

Well, if we go by American Constitutional standards, we are entitled to
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Getting a free trust fund
from daddy kind of deprives one of the right to pursue happiness, don't
you think? There is not right to take it with you, and with estate taxes
in the order of 50% here in the US, the highest rate of any tax here in
the US, with little political opposition to it (compared to the much
lower capital gains tax at 36% which is the political gadfly of
Republican politics), there seems to be little opposition to the
proposition that your kids don't have that much of a right to it either.

Communicable diseases require a community present to become pandemic.
Diseases like TB, smallpox, etc. have traditionally been a community
problem simply because they can reach epidemic proportions, so while
innoculations may seem socializable, treatment for cigarette induced
emphysema is not. What health threats are community problems and what
ones are individual problems? Therin lies the difference.

That individuals were smart enough to earn those assets implies a level
of intelligence to wisely dispose of that wealth upon death, but such is
not that case with much wealth that is inherited, and thus, not earned.

Here's a proposal that links in with the clone thread: ANy individual
has a right to the sanctity of his or her own genetic coding, but is
also legally and financially responsible for any liabilities incurred in
the dissemination of said genetic coding. THis brings in a concept that
one must be able to afford the reproduction of one's coding, from not
only birth, but to adulthood. Reproduction becomes a long term
investment (30-40 years to maturity) that one can not collect on.

of course, this is a politically impossible scenario, as the vast
majority of people having kids cannot rationally afford to have them
when they do, adn would go on the warpath against anyone trying to
interfere with their right to reproduce. But think about it. Just as one
must demonstrate financial responsibility to drive a car in most states
(insurance), people should have to demostrate financial responsibility
to have kids.

          By ASHLEY DUNN 

          The Cyborg as Warp-Speed Evolution

              Thirty-six years ago, Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline,
two medical researchers at
               Rockland State Hospital in Orangeburg, N.Y., published a
paper in the journal Astronautics
          that proposed a fascinating and strange solution to some
difficult problems of long space flights. 

          Clynes and Kline believed that trying to maintain a perfect
Earth
          environment in a space ship was both difficult and dangerous
          because of the fragility of a capsule and the enormous demands
          of the body for oxygen, food and water. 

          Millions of years of evolution created human bodies that are
          well adapted to Earth. But space posed a whole new
          environment to which humans were poorly suited. In space,
          people were fish out of water. 

          As a solution, they suggested slightly changing the human body
          so that it would be better suited to the rigors of space. They
          believed it was time to tinker with evolution. 

          "Space travel challenges mankind not only technologically but
          also spiritually, in that it invites man to take an active part
in his
          own biological evolution," the two researchers wrote. 

          Clynes, the chief research scientist at Rockland, and Kline, the
          director of research at the hospital, wrote in their 1960 paper
          that devices embedded in the body could automatically alter
          certain body functions and regulate them in the same way that
          the body does now. Through the use of drugs and other means,
          these devices could lower body temperature, heighten radiation
          resistance and even prevent future astronauts from feeling
          bored, depressed or sexually deprived on long flights. 

          With these devices there was the possibility of human beings
          living in space qua natura -- a native of the cosmos. To
describe this new being, they coined the
          term "cyborg," that is, a cybernetic organism. Included with
their paper was a picture of a white
          mouse with an osmotic pump over its tail -- the first cyborg. 

          Ever since the publication of "Cyborgs and Space" in 1960, the
concept of the human-machine
          being has entranced scientists and laymen alike. NASA even
published several reports on possible
          cyborg research, although it quickly abandoned the term in favor
of the more scientific sounding
          terms like "teleoperator" or "human augmentation." 

          Some people argue that a simple type of cyborg now makes up
about 10 percent of the
          population, a figure arrived at by adding up everybody with a
pacemaker, prosthetic device or
          other electrical or mechanical body component. Some have even
stretched the definition to include
          all those who work at computer terminals or some other form of
close linkage between humans
          and machines. 

          But the advanced cyborg envisioned by Clynes, Kline and others
-- one that enhances human
          abilities and totally merges with the body -- has largely
remained a denizen of science fiction,
          known to the public through characters like The Terminator or
RoboCop. 

          In the past decade, however, the cyborg has begun to emerge from
the world of fiction and
          assume a position of significance in the minds of sociologists,
historians and others as a symbol of
          the dissolving boundaries between humans and machines. 

          For millennia, human beings have protected the sanctity and
unity of the body. It was the filter
          through which our world was perceived and understood. It was the
element that defined our role
          and place in society. It defined our evolved position as the
masters of this planet. 

                             But the technological cataclysms of the past
century have gradually jarred
                             that view. We are no longer masters but
rather ants once again. Space
                             exploration has certainly placed human
existence in a new context. You
                             can feel the sense of smallness now. We no
longer perceive ourselves as
                             the center of the cosmos but as mere dust in
a vast universe. 

          Even here on Earth, the development of powerful technologies
like nuclear weapons and the
          computer have pointed out the inadequacies of homo sapiens. We
still excel in many areas, yet
          cannot compete against some of our own creations. The pace of
our body's evolution is too slow
          to adapt to the environment we have created. 

          In the past, humans have used tools and machinery (self-powered
tools) to overcome certain
          physical and mental weaknesses. But virtually all of them
required conscious action to manipulate. 

          Kline and Clynes believed that the solution lay in forging an
intimate connection between machines
          and the human mind below the conscious level. They proposed
automatic devices that required
          little monitoring by their human hosts. For example, an embedded
osmotic pump could be used to
          sense high radiation levels and then provide drugs that could
increase resistance. They also
          suggested using automatically administered drugs to lower body
temperature and thus to reduce
          the need for food and fluid. 

          One of my favorite examples is the use of an implanted drug pump
to combat psychotic episodes.
          The pump could be triggered remotely from earth or by the poor
fellow's crew mate in case of
          trouble. 

          In many ways, the key concept behind Clynes and Kline's cyborg
was the linking to subconscious
          functions. Only then did humans and machines operate as one --
just as the words cybernetic and
          organism had been collapsed into a single term. Clynes was far
more expansive in his definition of
          a cyborg, saying that even a person riding a bicycle could be
considered one because of the close
          link in operation between machine and rider. 

          In the years to follow, Clynes continued to develop the concept
of the cyborg, coming up with a
          Cyborg II, III, IV and V. 

          Cyborg II involved the manipulation of human emotions through a
series of mental exercises. III
          involved genetic alterations to enhance the human emotional
range, while IV involved deeper
          genetic changes and V brought the separation of mind from body. 

          What is fascinating about Clynes and his cyborgs is that he
believed that even with these extreme
          modifications to homo sapiens, there would be no change to the
fundamental essence of humans. 

          Clynes said in an interview published in 1995 in the "The Cyborg
Handbook" that these emotional
          and physical changes had in no way altered the ability of these
beings to experience emotions --
          "no more than riding a bicycle does, and even more importantly,
it hasn't altered their essential
          identity." 

          It seems strange to think that even minor modifications to the
body and mind -- the filters through
          which we perceive reality -- would not result in fundamental
changes. What if the blind could see
          or the weak become strong? 

          Perhaps there is some protected essence that can never be
changed. But what relevance does that
          have when something as radical as gender, mental capacity,
strength, emotional range and other
          aspects of life have been altered? Marshall McLuhan, who
insisted that electronic media were
          extensions of human senses, made a career out of dissecting how
just television and mass media
          brought about fundamental changes in how we perceive reality. 

          In the past few decades, the science of cyborgs has moved
slowly, but the imagery of the modern
          Frankenstein has captured the interest of sociologists,
historians and philosophers. For them, the
          image of a changeable, hybrid body and mind has come to stand
for a transformation of all the
          structures of the past, including race and gender dynamics, that
have grown out of the particular
          form of our bodies. 

          The cyborg is beginning to destroy the hard boundaries not only
between humans and machines
          but also between humans themselves. It is, as the science
historian Danna J. Haraway wrote, a
          reinvention of nature.

I would also differentiate between Libertarians and Republicans.
Republicans are statists and mercantilists, the opposite of
libertarians. They also let a heavy amount of religious dogma to hold
sway over principles.

considering that true free markets have yet to accrue ANY history, your
assertion is true, but only due to a lack of history. Here we must rely
on simulations unless we actually jump in with both hands. I would say
however that any imbalance is not a matter of free markets, but
government/mercantilist collusion to bias the market in favor of those
in power.

What you see as the human condition is the every day living conditions
of the average man, while I look at it as a more long term trend toward
allowing the market to maintain evolution's pace on humanity, rather
than using a controlled market to dumb down the genetic pool by coddling
the lower end of the bell curve. I see progress as an effect of
evolution on improving the average quality of the stock, rather than
cultivating the genes of the lowest quality strains, as the current
welfare state does.

This is true, any mechanism operating on positive feedback will
occillate out of control, however, only when the feedback mechanism is
opposed by an asymptotic function, like the employment utility curve.
Mechanisms operating on positive feedback do occillate out of control
when operating in a closed environment. Given unlimited resources,
positive feedback does not cause such behavior, so once space travel and
nanotech becomes practical, we wont be constrained by such limitations.

No ego ruffling there, simply stating facts reported by surveys of

Am totally against confiscation of assets one earns. Confiscation of
unearned income or assets is not a problem with me, since such assets
are unearned, they never belonged to the taxee to begin with.

The massive accrual of wealth that you describe, Bill Gates
notwithstanding, is typically a function of continuous inheritance,
generation after generation, than individuals monopolizing a marketplace
or asset base. Such market/asset consolidation usually takes two to four
generations.

Of course there could and should probably be minimal levels of gifts,
like the present $10,000/yr gift allowance, which is useful for
educational and entrepreneurial seed money, but not to accrue vast
transfer of  assests.

Extended lifespans only stretch out the time to confiscation, allowing
greater capital appreciation. As an example, Bill Gates has publicly
stated that he plans on giving all of his wealth away by the time he
dies.

here's another idea derived from my Uncle Marty's concept of how life
should be. He thinks that people should be retired until they are 45,
then they should work until they die. He figures most of the stuff
people wait until they are retired to do, is too strenuous to do by the
time they get there, so best do it in youth. Based on this idea, and our
present economy that is increasingly putting a premium on skill,
knowledge, intelligence, etc., that people should start working when
they finally start becoming skilled enough to make significant
contributions. Prior to that, education, exploration, etc. should be the
norm.

Unfortunately, John you and everyone else, including the poster
automatically assumed that "malnourished" meant "starving", when the two
words are very different. It is entirely possible for a malnourished
individual to be obese, as they are wrongly nourished by an excess of
starch and fat in their diets that does not meet with their metabolic
needs. An alcoholic can get more than their daily need of corbohydrates
from the beer they drink, and still be malnourished, as well as suffer
from a deficit of other nutrients.

Isn't that similar in principle to scholarships? A student who has an
established record of achievement is encouraged to realise their
potential by subsidising their costs. I don't see why the same mechanism
couldn't be applied more broadly.

        Yes, a few months ago I had an interview with CBC (via phone)
regarding uploading and the extropian view of how future mechanics will help
humanity rather than hinder it.  It appears that extropy *is* beginning to
be its own entity rather than being dubbed as "...a spinoff of objectivism"
or "neo-fascist" as has been the case before.  It is particularly
interesting that CBC itself has taken an interest, considering that it is
the only national network that is the earpiece to the Canadian government.
I look forward to seeing how your segment is received on "Big Life".

This idea violates Edwards' law regarding kids:

What is the difference between: inheriting money, that money being given to
the children just before death, and having parents spend their money to
raise their child ? How can a new born child pay for his mothers milk ?

You're using partly survivalist theory here to justify your view. In that
light:

The money was earned by the parents, who (also upon their death) spend that
money investing in the future wellbeing of their genetic codes.

Why 30-40 years ?

In many european countries wages are based on age, either by law or by the
influence governement (the largest employer) has on wages. Many examples
are known of starting wages 3 times smaller than wages near the end of
careers (for doing the same work). IMO setting those free, would already
solve part of this problem, which is actual, not hypothetical, since many
people here already ethically feel what you are saying here: 

> Just as one must demonstrate financial responsibility to drive a car >in

responsibility to have kids. 

Nature gave no individual (1 that is, not 2) the right to reproduce.
We changed that by allowing sperm to be sold commercially, allowing half of
our population that individual right. We also gave ourselves the right NOT
to reproduce. 

Weighing the childs individual rights in such matters is difficult. Today
the situation exists (where abortion is legal), where a child is the
property of an individual with 50% (or 51% ;-)) until a few moths before it
is born.

These problems are very difficult ones, and maybe a system should be
developed where kids become 'universal' on different levels. Adding
responsabilities and taking away priviliges once it has proven to be
capable of taking them / doing without them ?

Dear Max More,

Congratulations on your upcoming interview!

My suggestion re: extropian ideas is fairly simple.  

If the concept or application of cryonic suspension comes up, (or if you
*cause* it to come up) please stress that this IS an AFFORDABLE option for
people.

Through funding their suspension with life insurance, a person age "thirty
something" can get coverage in place for less than a dollar a day.  People
spend this on cigarettes!

A individual age "forty, fifty, or sixty something" can still get a
permanent, universal life coverage for 1 to 3 dollars a day.  

Having been signed up with ALCOR for several years, and being in the
financial planning and insurance business for 18 years,  I firmly believe at
least *one* of the reasons more folks are not yet "signed up" for the cryonic
suspension option is that they do not realize how INEXPENSIVE this option can
be.

I know there are philisophical / religious objections, etc. re: cryonics.

But show someone they have a *chance* to be immortal for a really small and
VERY "doable" amount of money, and I think we will have a lot more people
thinking like extropians!

I have admired your writings for years.  Congratulations also on your Ph D.,
which I guess you have had for some time now. 

Upward and Outward,

I'm not sure in what context Gates stated this (i.e., flip or a sudden
stroke of altruism.)  Also, he could reconsider his current views on death,
in which case he would then reconsider giving away *all* his money.  If
comes to the conclusion that death is not necessary - valuing living
indefinitely; he just might invest his money in extending lifespans.

And yet your basic person out there will be quite threatened by the 
potential of altering that which s/he has always been taught not to 
alter, either for religious or cultural reasons.  Not to mention 
resentful of the added personal responsibility.   Body-mod will seem very 
extremely radical to them.  

I was out by the White House the other afternoon, saw a 
large group of religious fundies protesting, and they were 
chanting something about 'no more cyborgs'.  I wanted to ask them 
what they were talking about (pacemakers?) but the Secret Service guy 
begged me not to start anything, so I didn't.  I wonder if religious 
leaders are taking steps to cast body modification into a satanic 
mold.  Has anyone heard more on this?

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

This is not a case of government  vs. science.  
  
Scientists in two different countries (France and the United States), first
said HIV causes AIDS, not "governments."  Governments are mindless idiots.
 The governments only adopted what the scientists proved via the peer review
process.    
  
Scientists developed the current screening tests showing the HIV viral
antibodies in AIDS infected fluids.  Using Koch's postulates HIV was shown to
cause AIDS.  The "dissidents" have not shown the contrary.  The dissidents
have been rejected via peer review.  HIV = AIDS could be completely wrong but
the dissidents have no acceptable evidence. 
  
Governments are politically correct to suit themselves.  It is true they
don't care for science unless it is politically correct.  HIV causes AIDS is
currently both scientifically supportable and politically correct.  Otherwise
governments would say anything off -the-wall, such as AIDS is the wrath of
God.  Just as off-the-wall as what the dissidents are currently saying.

In order to make your point forcefully you could put it in a personal form.
I told a friend at work that I was really looking forward to being cloned,
so I could have the clone force-grown to the age of 20 or so and have my
brain plugged in once medical tech gets better. Then I can relive my life
from that age and make all the mistakes I made them ... but I'll make more
of them, and enjoy them more. ;>

I think the most important scientific implication from the recent sheep
cloning experiment is that the mammalian genome does not appear to
undergo irreversible changes as cells differentiate.
In other words, the actual DNA which was removed from the adult sheep and
implanted into the enucleated egg was completely intact.
These cloning experiments could be used to refute the somatic mutation
theory of aging. This states that aging is a direct consequence of
accumulated mutations in the somatic (non-germ line) cells of the adult
body. The DNA contained in the germ line cells (i.e testis and ovary) is
assumed to be highly protected from mutations, otherwise entire species
would age.
The recent cloning experiments suggest that DNA can be kept in
"good helath" without having to be confined to the germ line cells.They
also suggest to me that aging could be (at least in part) an epigenetic
phenomenon.
I wonder how many years the original DNA from the donor sheep could be
propagated in consecutive clones without going through the germ cells?
It could turn out to be many times the lifetime of an average sheep.
If we could find out how the cloning process is rejuvenating the DNA, we
could try to mimic the process without actually having to clone ourselves.
This would clear up a lot of the problems associated with identity etc.
which have been discussed on this list.

Early last fall there was some discussion about replacing 'Spontaneous 
Order' in BEST DO IT SO with 'Self Ownership'.  If I recall, 
Spontaneous Order was disliked because it was a term from biology that 
seemed too submissive to whatever 'blind' evolution threw at us and 
Self Ownership was preferred because it was more 'libertarian' or 
suggestive of individual responsibility and creativity.

I was looking at Stuart Kauffman's _At Home In the Universe_ the other 
day and noticed that the older term Spontaneous Order had been pretty 
much replaced by the newer term 'Self Organization'.  It's clearly 
more extropic to use 'self' rather than 'spontaneous' because that 
emphasizes the agent rather than the environment.  Self Organization 
seems like a nice compromise to me because 'organization' seems to 
imply a combination of both the other two concepts: external order and 
intrinsic ownership, along with the ability to chart one's own course 
between the two.

WACO FLIR: AN EXPERT'S ANALYSIS

This is Dr. Edward Allard's analysis of the Waco FLIR
(Forward Looking InfraRed) video.  The first 4 points
describe his experience, in 6 through 12 he describes
FLIR events, and in 13 gives his conclusion.  While
Dr. Allard describes only a few FLIR muzzle flashes
here, the defense team has now identified 66 shots
almost all toward the building, 44 of which are
after the fire starts.  --  Ian Goddard

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.

DECLARATION OF EDWARD F. ALLARD, PhD.

Edward F. Allard declares and states as follows:

1. My name is Edward F. Allard. I have worked for many years in the
field of radiation physics related to thermal imaging, thermal signatures,
thermal suppression and especially in aspects of those subjects relating
to Forward Looking Infrared [FLIR] military systems.

2. My experience is set forth in my curriculum vitae, which is attached
to this declaration. I received my Bachelor of Science in physics from
Boston College and my doctorate in physics from the University of Missouri.
I hold Patent No. 4,413,668 on a device to suppress thermal signatures
and Patent no. 5,013,092 on a microdischarge image intensifier. My
inventions and studies will enable use of uncooled thermal imagers with
predicted performance better than the current TOW antitank missile night
sight; design and calculation for these required an expert knowledge of
photocathodes, photo detectors, signal detection, noise, charge transfer
and optics for thermal imaging devices.

3. I began my career in this field as a supervisor at the Defense
Department's Night Vision Laboratory, later becoming Deputy Director,
Systems Development. My team developed and defended a variety of programs
in the area, including L3TV systems, the thermal night sight for the
Dragon antitank weapon, the night sight for the TOW antitank missile
system, and other programs. NVL pioneered the Common Module System that
is the foundation of the thermal imaging systems used in Operation Desert
Storm.

4. As a defense contractor and government employee, I have analyzed a
number of thermal imaging devices. These include comparisons of L3TV
with thermal imagers, comparisons of American and foreign imagers,
analyses of the thermal imager for the M1 tank, design of thermal
pointing systems, construction of a T-62 thermal target for tank
gunnery, and countermeasures to completely hide an M60 tank from enemy
FLIR and to reduce FLIR signatures of tents, trucks, ships, and
individual soldiers.  The interpretation of FLIR imagery requires skill
and experience. As but a few examples, materials which reflect sunlight
and thus seem bright in the visible spectrum will often appear indistinct,
or even dark, to a thermal imager; the very reflective properties that
make them bright to the eye make them appear cool, and thus dark, to
FLIR systems. Interpretation of thermal images requires a knowledge
of the reflective properties of both natural and man-made objects.

5. I have reviewed a FLIR tape depicting the events outside Waco, Texas,
on April 19, 1993, which tape was obtained from one of the defense
attorneys involved in the criminal cases that arose out of those events.
My analysis of the tape follows. All times given are those shown in the
timeclock shown in the tape. All directions are given from the standpoint
of the viewer.

6. At 11:24:31, the FLIR is recording events in the rear of the building,
where the Combat Engineering Vehicle [CEV] has partially demolished the
area known as the "gymnasium." The FLIR shows several flashes appearing
from a point to the left of the CEV. These are elongated in shape, several
feet long, and appear and disappear at a regular rate with regular spacing
between them. I note five flashes from one point, appearing and disappearing
at the rate of 7-10 per second. At this location some non-flashing movement
also appears visible. There is no natural explanation for these flashes.
Natural phenomena do not heat and cool in fractions of a second. My expert
opinion is that these flashes appear to be the muzzle flashes of a fully-
automatic firearm, firing at about 500 rounds per minute cyclic rate.
Carefully examined, in slow motion and by frame-to-frame observation, the
flashes originate to the left and progress to the right, indicating that
they are being fired from a source outside the building, and fired into
the building.

7. At 11:42:56, the aircraft bearing the FLIR is circling the side of the
building. A hot image is visible inside the side, ground floor, window of
the "corner tower." As the aircraft continues its movement the image
vanishes, underscoring the fact that the image is a hot object inside the
room, the sight of which is lost as the aircraft moves on and alters the
perspective through the window.

8. At 11:44:52, a momentary flash of radiation is seen to the rear of the
central "tower." This may be at a location in the open area to the immediate
rear of the building. The flash is visible for ten frames, approximately a
third of a second, much longer than the flashes described above. It is not
possible with these data to determine the cause or source of the flash.

9. At 11:47:50, the FLIR is recording events at the front of the building. A
CEV has driven into the building, withdrawn, and has a large piece of rubble
lodged on the front of the vehicle. An individual is dimly visible exiting
the vehicle, walking to its front, and dislodging the rubble. The CEV is at
this point halted within a vehicle length, perhaps twenty feet, of the front
of the building.

10. At 12:07:40-42, the aircraft bearing the FLIR is circling past the right
tower. A heat source, long and narrow in form, quickly appears across a
window of the tower. Upon careful examination, slow motion and frame-by-
frame, I believe this is more likely to be a heat source outside the window,
than one inside it. It is noteworthy that the image does not vanish or fade 
as the aircraft flies past, in contrast to the heat signature noted at 
11:42:56.

11. At 12:08:32, the FLIR depicts events at the rear of the building, where
the large "gymnasium" structure has largely been demolished. Two very bright
thermal flashes are visible near to or in the window at the center, in front
of and to one side of the CEV which is stopped there. I see no natural
explanation for these flashes. They would not, for instance, be reflections
of sunlight off glass.

12. At 12:08:52 there are again radiation flashes, which I believe to be
firearms fire, from the side and rear of the CEV.  Again, when carefully
examined they appear to move in the direction of the building.

13. In brief, my examination of the FLIR tape indicates:

a. An analysis of the tape, field by field, reveals thermal flashes
occurring that have pulse times and time intervals between them
consistent with the intervals of automatic weapons fire. Pulses of
approximately 1/15 second occur. There are no naturally-
occurring phenomena that could explain these events.

b. Other thermal flashes of radiation, approximately 1/3 second in
duration, occur in various areas of the building complex. Again,
no naturally-occurring phenomena can explain this.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct.

I've picked up a copy of "At Home In the Universe" some weeks ago, and I am 
sorry to say I found it to be quite weak. Highly untypical of Stu K.'s 
prosa. It does not seem (I am not through yet, though) to contain 
results going beyond those of "The Origins of Order" (but some neat 
microfossil pics are new), while at the same time lacking all the hard 
data found in TOOO. Where's the beef?! one might be tempted to exclaim. 

A heavily watered down version of TOOO, nothing else. If you have some extra 
money _and_ time, buy it before reading T3O. Otherwise, invest in 
platinum bonds, or beer.

Thanks Alan and others for your suggestions. Despite the early hour of
filming I think the Big Life interview went well. I should get about 8-9
minutes of airtime. It shows tomorrow on CBC. I didn't cover all the points
I wanted to mention, but did put the cloning breakthrough in an extropian
context.

I'm just reading Kauffman's book now. Version 3.0 of the Extropian
Principles won't be completed for a while since I have other urgent writing
priorities. When I get back to it I'll certainly consider whether
"Self-Organization" should replace "Spontaneous Order" as the name of that
principle. Note, thout, that this principle will most likely be in
*addition* to Self-Ownership rather than the latter replacing the former
(as I originally thought).

It would be interesting indeed, if a huge money player got involved in
immortalist research. I remember in R.A.Wilson's book,'Schroedinger's Cat',
 the president offered a huge sum of money to anyone who could extend life or
find a cure for death and it happened really quickly. It is always surprising
to me that in a country that spends over a billion a year billion on
cosmetics to make us look young and beautiful, no one really bigtime wants to
fund cryonics or longevity research...
It's intrinsic value seems so damned OBVIOUS to me...

I haven't read it, but I've leafed through it a few times and noticed
that much (at least 50%, I'd guesstimate) of the material has been
adapted from Friedman's excellent but basic price theory textbook, 
PRICE THEORY. Now when I first read PRICE THEORY, I thought, "Gee, 
this is a great book. Everyone should read it. Too bad it's packaged
as a scary college econ textbook." It seems to me that HIDDEN ORDER
addresses this packaging concern perfectly.

It's not nearly as elementary and braindead as INNUMERACY, though.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I hate to sound like an ad, but there's a new antioxidant
formula available with antioxidants previously unavailable
in the U.S. -- hence the definition "new."

The patented formula, called ACF-223, contains: 

   NDGA (nordihydroguairetic acid) 
   MEA (2-Mercaptoethylamine)
   BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene)

NDGA is an extremely powerful antioxidant found in a 
species of life-form with a member that is the oldest 
known living entity on earth: the chapparel herb. Native
Americans were aware of its healthful properties and used 
it to treat cancer [1]. It appears that NDGA inhibits the 
respiration of tumor cells [2]. A plant containing NDGA 
(I assume chapparel) was always the first to reappear in 
nuclear-bomb-test-blast zones in the southwest, and studies
showed that NDGA was the reason that this plant could 
survive and that animals that eat it also had a higher
incidence of surviving the severe-radiation exposure [3], 
which is a form of free-radical damage. I've also read, 
but alas cannot now find the book, that NDGA also inhibits
the respiration of various pathogens such as viri and/ 
or bacteria, but minus the reference you'll just have 
to rely on Goddardian memory for this detail -- hope
that Ginko is working.

MEA increased the life-span of laboratory animals by 
30% [4], and is specifically powerful in quenching 
iron-based free radicals. Some experts believe that 
iron-based free-radical damage is more causally 
correlated to heart attacks that high cholesterol, 
high blood pressure, or diabetes [4]. 

BHT is fairly well-know to life extensionists. As 
I understand research continues to come out showing 
favorable outcomes. My only concern with this agent 
is that it is correlated with the induction of higher
level of liver enzymes, which can signal liver damage,
but I'm not aware of any evidence that liver damage is
associated with BHT, and I'm aware of a lot of promising
effects. For more on BHT and possible risks consult Durk 
Pearson and Sandy Shaw's classic: LIFE EXTENSION.

Anyway -- and here's where I cannot avoid sounding 
like an ad (and I'm not making any money off this,
though I wish I were!!) -- you can get this patented 
anti-ox formula ACF-223 only via GERO-VITAL: 1-800-694-8366

The recent discussions about libertarian/anarcho-capitalist political 
philosophy and the supposed benefits and flaws which would be found in 
societies operating purely under those principles points out a crucial 
missing element - real world experience.  In other words, all of this is 
pure speculation until such a society actually forms and provides an 
example of whether or not such a society society actually works.

To my knowledge there are several projects underway which would attempt 
to create such societies:

1. The Atlantis Project (http://www.oceania.org) aims to create an 
island.  As far as I can tell, this one just kinda mysteriously stopped 
about 2 years ago.

2. The Laissez Faire City (http://www.lfcity.com/) project takes a 
different tack, and is planning to obtain a 100-year lease of a parcel of 
land from some host country.  I assume they've done their homework and 
are confident that such a property could be run/operated independently 
from the host country.  They also claim to have established an "interim 
community" in Costa Rica which allows members to live tax free.  All of 
which sounds interesting, but I have a gut-level suspicion of any group 
that asks me to pay $35 for additional "research materials."

3. The Millenial Project (http://www.millennial.org), has a comprehensive 
plan for "colonizing the galaxy in 8 easy steps."  One of the beginning 
stages involves building ocean colonies.  In addition, the members of one 
of their chapters are currently planning a land-based colony to research 
the social and environmental aspects of living together in a group 
(http://www.neca.com/~dimitri/lbc.html).  While the folks at TMP are not 
explicitly libertarian, from what I've seen they lean towards strong 
protection of individual rights for their colonists.

And these are just the ones I know about which focus on Earth-based 
colonies.

I'm interested in getting additional feedback from the members of this 
list:

Do you know of other similar projects?

Do you feel that you can achieve personal freedom within the confines of 
current government structures, or would you only feel truly free living 
in a libertarian society?

Do you feel that a libertarian society can be realized by working within 
the political system to change existing governments, or do you feel that 
such a society can only be realized by starting fresh from scratch?

Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a 
libertarian colony?

Thanks in advance.  Hope this helps to turn our discussions towards the 
more practical aspects of libertarianism.

Eric is still around, and the web pages are still there.  He hasn't
printed the passports or done some other things in the plan, but he
still has the big model and still has copies of the Constitution and
other literature, I believe.  The project took a bad hit when we
bought a much larger model than planned, and then donations dried up.
That left us in debt, and unable to continue advertising and doing
other promotional things until the model was paid off.  I left to get
a "real" job; the other co-founders are out of touch.  I think there
is still some hope left for this one.

Don't know much about this one.  At least when the AP sold Constitutions,
we told you up front that you were paying $30 for a paperback editition
of a document you could download for free :)  Does LFC tell you what you
get for that $35?

AP and MP have exchanged technical information on oceanic construction
and desalinization and such, and they do in fact have a fair membership
overlap with AP, so are likely to be libertarian whether they like it
or not.  My impression of the other folks there is that they are non-
political technophiles.

I think there is one way to do it from the inside: to form the nation (i.e.
the people) before you form the country (i.e., the land).  Accumulate a
group, each of which pledges to never use force against any other member,
and slowly build that group into economic self-sufficiency (cybercash and
similar technologies help a lot here) so that the government of the land
they occupy simply atrophies, or sells itself off to us.  It may take
decades, even generations, but I think it would work to both free us and
allow us to keep our land.

I would, and I have.  Personally, though, I am unlikely to discuss the
"practical" ascpects of libertarianism, as I do not look at liberty as
an end result, but rather as a prior condition; a means, not an end.

Hah! Well it's extropianism for moderates. :-)

The neat acronym won't survive since I'm changing at the name of at least
one other principle -- Boundless Expansion puts some off before they even
read it. They seem to take it to imply that we want to pave over the
universe. That one will probably become "Boundless Improvement"

I love a good acronym, but won't let preserving one get in the way of
improving the principles.

Can you elaborate on this? I don't know of any major British newspapers

I read it a few months ago.  (After being named in the dedication, how

Yes, its a price theory textbook pretending to be a chatty book for
the rest of us.  Nice examples, but there are some places where the
reader will have to pay attention and really think or get lost (like a
textbook).

I'm not sure how many people will fall for that, but D.D.Fr. claims at
least a few thousand.  I'm not sure how many of them have already read
an intro econ text.

As someone said on Usenet recently, "The reason why food is cheaper in
Hong Kong than Japan is that Hong Kong has no farmers..." The cost of rice
in Japan is only so high because of government controls which increase
prices to subsidise Japanese rice growers.

I think the big problem was that the list members (but not neccesarily the
administrators) treated it more as a game than a serious effort. With the
PPLs on the list the worst thing that could happen to you was to be thrown
off. With real PPLs you could become an outlaw and probably end up being
shot. So the costs and benefits of compliance were very different to the
way they would be in real life.

That's why I said 'libertarian societies' rather than specifically
anarcho-capitalism... but anarcho-capitalists always have the option of
creating a government, whereas minarchists can't then get rid of it.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org


Creativity is often looked upon as a mysterious magical quality of artists.
Yet, the word creativity covers a wide range of skills. For example, Do Bono
writes:

"A few people, a very few people, now know that there is an absolute
mathematical necessity for human creativity because of the way human
perception works as a self-organiziang information system.  Such systems
demand creativity and also provocation."

and, more:

"... These systems are patterning systems.  They make and use patterns.
>From an analysis of the behavior and potential behavior in such system we
can get a very clear idea of the nature of creativity.  All at once the
mystique of creativity falls away. We can see how creativity works. We can
also see how we might devise techniques to increase the possibility of new
ideas. In a sense we come to look at the "logic" of creativity. ... No leap
of faith or mystical acceptance is required. There is no mysterious black
box labeled, 'in here it all happens.'"

Learning how to be creative require an ability to train thought patterns to
take new routes. Conjecture helps us to seek new paths. Just as conceptual
art produced great thought, but little end product; imagining is a great
training field for ideas, as long as we don't get caught up in the very
hypothesizing.

Taking it a step further, we can add to the concept of "serious" creativity
and give it more spin. Perhaps the earnest use of creativity could be a
panacea for our extropic achievements. Just point to your head and say, "In
here it all happens!"

>A heavily watered down version of TOOO, nothing else. [...]

Well, I got something interesting out of it: after reading TOOO, there
were a couple questions I was really confused about (what exactly is the
"error catastrophe" and why is it important? and what does he mean saying
SO is opposed to selection?) and I dreaded rereading TOOO (huge) to try to
figure these things out (no guarantee).

So At Home functioned as a sort of fast-forward, for-dummies version of
stuff I remembered the details of.  Got the answers to the questions and
a little more.  Basically:
   1) The error catastrophe is a problem that exists in a stupid
      oversimplified model of evolution, a non-problem, straw-man.
   2) Kaufmann defines SO in such a way that it's the mirror-image of the
      "problem" he's trying to solve: "complexity."  (He defines them both
      as hierarchical structure, basically.)
   3) He surprises himself by "solving" the "problem" with the "solution".
   4) In At Home he sort of backs down and says SO is _complementary to_
      selection, which is correct.  It's an important (but hard to avoid)
      aspect of living things and how genes code that makes it possible
      for them to keep evolving to more complex forms.

I have to say, his work with "NK" networks and especially with the auto-
catalytic set model of early evolution is way way cool.  Kaufmann is God.
But not a writer.

In TOOO, he both overhypes the main ideas and buries them in detail.

In At Home he dilutes and sugars them unbelievably.  They guy is either
condescending or a lune in the philosophy lobes.  But I got what I needed
out of it and gave it back to the guy I borrowed it from.  TOOO stays on
my shelf.

That's so true. I remember the look on my (socialist) girlfriends face 
when I first took her round a good US supermarket. Massive variety, 
higher quality, and lower prices. It was even open *when 9-5 people 
weren't at work*, which was almost unknown in the UK back then. 
Meanwhile, the EU issues directives on how much we should pay farmers for 
not farming land, while at the same time setting penalties for letting 
non-farmed land become inhabited by meadowflowers and songbirds. And 
don't get me started on the Fisheries (or total destruction thereof) 
Policy. I'm beginning to despair of this continent. My dynamic optimism

Creation


Love ruminates and illuminates
And dances upon the artist's soul,
With a cloven foot and a callused palm
And a will to make the meaning whole.

Life's creations reveal sensations
And notions of what beauty should be,
And what it is now and has always been
And helps unveil the mystery.

The artist creates, his passion pulsates,
And the world is awed by his intent --unclear,
While their thoughts try to hide from their mind's eyes
And what they want to see, they try to fear.

For all that is true, and all that is new
Is never enough to convince those who Know,
And the truth is forbidden --merely locked inside,
And the process of art is painful and slow.

But the artist persists and his spirit resists
The ties to all judgment and extrapolation,
He ignores all the bounds and demands on his work
And devotes himself wholly to his creation.

I agree strongly that we need to remove the mysticism from the 
creative process, both to render it more accessible as an activity 
for everyone, and to deepen appreciation of what artists do 
accomplish through their skills and training.  I also think that the

in this insistence on treating artists as if they were divine conduits.  

And yet I wonder whether people really want to understand the

AHA!! Kathryn you have hit on what i consider to be a MAJOR truth, re;
critics and  speculators (routinely on this list, scientists and tech people,
but in the real world, any layperson) not taking responsiblity for
themselves, and the belief that art is a totally subjective field, a
biproduct of man's psyche, rather than a field of infinite posiblities for
(as you have suggested many times in your posts) communication, functionality
and quality.

Art, creativity, in its many forms- including design, communicates
nonverbally, causes things to form ( by plan or example) , and creativity is
an integral part of improving the quality of life, even as much as, but
certainly in conjunction with, technology. The laziness you speak of is
rarely confronted in this forum, and I thank you for your insight.

> "perfectly preserved 400,000 year old wooden spears"!

  There's no reason for the exclamation point except perhaps to remark
on the fact that circumstances conspired to preserve artifacts made
from organic substance for that long.  Stone tools which most people
would say are of comparable complexity to simple wooden spears, if not
more complex, are known from something like two million years before
the present; also dating from a million years ago, or longer, is
indirect evidence of the use of leather containers (polishing of stone
artifacts, or maybe it was bone), and evidence of possible systematic
use of fire (not to say its creation).

> Just what *did* happen to humans in the last 50,000 years?  

  A fine question; possibly the time should be a little more remote,
but that's a detail.  Biologically, nobody knows, and there is much
controversy.  Culturally, by degrees, fancier technology, and evidence
of larger-scale and more sophisticated cooperation.

Watched Solo the other day...
Pretty cheesy movie about a military AI that has feelings and ethics (altough
apparently his designer does not) and rescues thrid world Indians from some
Castro types...I think he is a libertarian though, cause there's a funny
little line about him doing it "for a trade". ( no Altruist, this borg)
Mario is sure pretty , is he taking steriods or is that all natural?

All in all a really bad film, but one thing I loved was this creature- even
though he was a weapon by design, once he had his free will chip ( or
whatever happens) he spent all his spare time designing and drawing -
replicas of spiders, and other master designs of nature.. 
I often speculate that AI's ( if they get freewill)  will be mostly artists,
industrial designers,  and inventors, focusing on design, design and more
design...

What about Graham Hancock's theories?  Anybody have any opinions on that?

(He wrote a best seller recently, I forget the title, which propounded a
theory that some pretty advanced - not ridiculously advanced, but quite
civilised and medium tech - civilisations arose in the past and were
destroyed by some sort of geomagnetic phenomenon, and that it has
happened not just once but several times. He reckons that the Cheops
pyramid and the Sphinx, and a few other monuments scattered over the
world, are much older than has been thought up till now, and are kind of
encoded warnings about this fairly regular catastrophic cycle. Some of
it's a bit von Danikenish, but a lot of it seems quite coherent.)

I'd quibble over words here, though I basically agree.  Learning neural

That's part of it.  Letting one's train of thought jump the tracks is merely
daydreaming or smoking dope.  Anyone can do that.  The essential part of 
creativity is doing something with that meandering thought; getting it to
alight on another - perhaps new - track.

The extreme of letting one's thoughts take new routes is insanity. ( Many
notable artists and musicians are known to strayed over the edge. )  The
trick is to let the thoughts loose, but not too loose.

I digress for a moment...

Chris Langton did a paper on cellular automata, in which he describes
the measurement of information flow in a CA, which he measured with what
he called the Lambda parameter.  When Lambda was zero or close to it,
the CAs were static.  At a higher level - about .2 - the CAs were periodic.
Anything over about .3 resulted in chaos.  But just on the edge between 
the two, at about .270, there was a region of complexity that was stable
but not periodic. ( J.H.Conway's Life was .273 )

...end of digression.

Both human thought and CAs seem to have regions of periodicity and excess
activity with a 'sweet spot' somewhere between.

I suggest that human creativity might be describable in a similar space
and measurable by a similar parameter.  Any thoughts on this?

I said :

Davon C. Enigl said:

Robert Gallo and his employer, the Department of Health and Human Services held
a press conference on April 23, 1984, more than a week BEFORE Gallo's papers
were to be
printed in the journal Science.  The Secretary of HHS, Margaret Heckler,
sponsored this
huge event and introduced Gallo to the press.  Backed by the prestige of the
government,
she officially declared this virus was the probable cause of AIDS.  Before
any paper had
been published in a peer reviewed journal. Before any other scientist could
review and 
comment on Gallo's claim, the government had decided the matter. Had other
researchers 
been free to examine Gallo's papers for themselves, they might have pointed
out that some of his AIDS patients had never been infected by the virus.
They might have pointed out that no virus had been found in ANY of Gallo's
AIDS patients, but only antibodies
against it. 

>Using Koch's postulates HIV was shown to cause AIDS. The "dissidents" have
not shown
>the contrary.

Hardly.  Leading AIDS researchers have acknowledged that HIV fails Koch's
postulates as the cause of AIDS.  For example: Gallo, R.C.,
Virus-Hunting-AIDS, Cancer and the Human Retrovirus: A Story of Scientific
Discovery, Basic Books, NY 1991; or Blatner, W.A., R.C. Gallo, and H.M.
Temin. HIV causes AIDS. Science 241 (1988):514-515; or Weiss, R. and H.
Jaffe. Duesberg, HIV and AIDS. Nature (London) 345 (1990) 659-660.
Nevertheless, they have argued that the failure of HIV to meet Koch's
postulates invalidates these postulates rather than invalidating HIV as the
cause of AIDS.  For example, Gallo in his 1991 book said:

"Rules were needed than, and can be helpful now, but not if they are too
blindly followed.  Robert Koch, a great microbiologist, has suffered from a
malady that affects many other great men: he has been taken too literally
and too seriously for too long...Koch's Postulates, while continuing to be
an excellent teaching device, are far from absolute in the real world
outside the classroom." (Gallo, Virus-Hunting...page 277)

But Koch's postulates consist of elementary logic.  Whereas technology is
continually being outdated, logic is permanent.  Koch's rules, after all,
simply restate the germ theory itself in experimental terms.  Gallo never
tries to explain how logic would change over time, nor does Gallo offer any
rigorous scientific rules to replace Koch's Postulates.  

Koch's 1st postulate is that the microbe must be found in all cases of the
disease.
Robert Koch explicitly said a casual germ would be found in high
concentrations in the
patient and distributed in the diseased tissues. If HIV were actively
infecting T-cells then cell-free virus particles, called virions, should be
easily found circulating in the blood. This is the case with all classical
viral diseases: Patients with Hepatitus B will have about 10 million free
virus particles per milliliter of blood; Flu-like symptoms will appear only
in the presence of 1 million rhinovirus particles per milliliter of nasal
mucous. HIV, like other retroviruses, can achieve high levels of virus when
first infecting the body (up to 100,000 particles per milliliter of blood),
but in most people HIV is then permanently inactivated by the antibodies
generated against it.

Retroviruses do not typically kill their host cells.  In 1984, in Science,
Gallo said HIV kills T-cells and that is the cause of AIDS. Yet HIV is grown
in cultures of T-cells where, away from the antibodies to inhibit it, it
reaches levels of 1,000,000 virus particles per milliliter without killing
T-cells. If it doesn't kill T-cells then, how is it going to do it when it
is suppressed to nearly undetectable levels by antibody?

Pathogenic virus typically cause disease as a consequence of infecting,
replicating in, and  killing more cells than a host can regenerate or spare.
Complete proviral HIV has only been demonstrated in one in several thousand
peripheral blood monocular cells (in both asymptomatic and symptomatic
persons), and HIV RNA is detected in 1 tp 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 such cells
(Simmonds et al., J. Virol. 64:864, 1990). Yet 5% of the body's
T-cells are regenerated in the two days it takes HIV to establish an
infection (Guyton,
Textbook of Medical Physiology, 1987, WB Saunders, Phil.). 

Viruses typically cause disease shortly after infection, before the immune
system of their host can respond. There is no other example of a viral
pathogen which causes primary disease only after long and unpredictable
latent periods, and only in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, as HIV
is said to do.

Koch's second postulate: The microbe must be isolated from the host and
grown in culture. This postulate was designed to prove that a given disease
was caused by a particular germ, rather than by some undetermined mixture of
noninfectious substances. HIV has been isolated and is now grown
continuously in HIV research labs. This rule therefore has technically
fulfilled, but only in some instances.

Since free virus is rarely found in AIDS victims, HIV can be retrieved only
from the great majority of them by reactivating the latent form of the
virus. Millions of white blood cells must be taken from the patient and
grown in culture dishes for weeks, during which time chemical stimulants
that shock cells into growing or mutating are added to awaken any dormant
HIV from within its host cells. Given enough patience and plenty of
repetition such procedure, a single intact virus can eventually be
activated, at which point it starts infecting the remaining cultured cells.
Yet even this powerful method does not yield active virus from many AIDS
cases that have confirmed antibodies against HIV. 

Koch's third postulate: The microbe must reproduce the original disease when
introduced into a susceptible host.  This condition can be tested in one of
three ways: infection of laboratory animals, accidental and natural
infection of humans, or by vaccination experiments. HIV fails all three
tests. (data available upon request, check "Inventing the AIDS Virus" by
Duesberg, page 182)

Duesberg argues that AIDS is not infectious. Gallo and the CDC says it is.
Based on common characteristics of all orthodox infections, infectious AIDS
would be predicted to:

1. Spread randomly between the sexes. 
2. Cause primary disease within weeks or months after infection, because
infectious agents multiply exponentially in susceptible hosts until stopped
by immunity. They are self-replicating, and thus fast-acting, toxins.  Slow
pathogenicity by a neutralized virus has never been experimentally proven.
3. Coincide with a common, active and abundant microbe in all cases of the
same disease. (Inactive microbes or microbes at low concentrations are
harmless passengers,e.g. lysogenic bacteriophages, endogenous and latent
retroviruses, latent herpes, etc..  Hibernation is a proven microbal
strategy of survival, which allows indefinite coexistence with the host
without pathogenicity.)
4. Lyse or render nonfunctional more cells than the host can spare of
regenerate.
5. Generate a predictable pattern of symptoms. 

By contrast noninfectious AIDS, caused by tozins, would be predicted to:

1. Spread nonrandomly, according to exposure to toxins.
2. Follow intoxication after variable intervals as determined by lifetime
dosage and personal thresholds for disease. 
3. Manifest toxin- and intoxication-site-specific diseases, e.g., cigarettes
causing lung cancer and alcohol causing liver cirrhosis.

AIDS is incompatible with classical criteria of infectious disease:

1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,
American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, although no
AIDS disease is male specific.
2. HIV is said to cause AIDS only after a peculiar latent period.  There is
no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary diseases on average
only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only after 2 years in
children.  The diversity of these latent periods is inconsistent with one
infectious agent and their magnitude is characteristic for diseases caused
by chronic exposure to toxic substances.
3. There is no common, predictable pattern of AIDS symptoms in patients of
different risk groups.  Instead, different risk groups have their own
characteristic AIDS diseases.

In response to these arguments, Goudsmit, a proponent of the HIV AIDS
hypothesis, confirmed "AIDS does not have the characteristics of an ordinary
infectious disease.  This view is incontrovertible." (Goudsmit, J.,
Alternative View on AIDS. Lancet 339 (1992):1289-1290.)  Likewise,
epidemiologists Eggers and Weyer conclude that "the spread of AIDS does not
behave like the spread of a disease that is caused by a single sexually
transmitted agent." (Eggers, H.J. and J.J. Weyer. Linkage and independence
of AIDS Kaposi disease: the interaction of HIV and some coagents. Infection.
19(1991):115-122.

>HIV causes AIDS is scientifically supportable....

HIV=AIDS violates many established principles of virology, including Kochs
postulates and Farr's law.  You mention that you are a microbiologist.  When
the government announced that HIV was the probable cause of AIDS, they said
they would have a vaccine in 2 years.  A vaccine would give you antibody to
HIV. Today, if I walk into a doctors office and test positive for antibody
to HIV, it is bad news.  If the government developed a vaccine, and then I
walked into a doctors office and tested positive for antibody, would that be
good news or bad?  How would the doctor know if the antibody I had was from
the vaccine (presumably good news), or the antibody that today is bad news?

It's good to hear that my arguments of a few months back were not in
vain. Also, having such old tools makes the gap between us and them much
smaller, not bigger. What they probably did not have was a stable enough
community to allow for even tribalism, which would work to develop a
verbal community history, helping to preserve acquired knowledge.

I have no disagreement with your statement of causes.  But my comments were
about mechanism of creation/insanity and modeling thereof, not the cause 
of insanity.

Exactly, Art can be a very rational process. Just like there are businesses
who just supply to a public demand, there are artist who do that. 

But just like there are businesses who try to create a new market for their
product, starting from the point of view of the quality of that product,
there are artists who do the same.

The problem with these theories is that they haven't been published yet to
scientific historical/archeological magazines, and the argumenting parties
(pro and con) seem to talking to themselves rather than to eachother.

This is true, except that one need not always ACT on a creative thought for
it to be valuable. It need not even be coherent to stir new thoughts into
fruition.
And, further,  acting on it does not make it meaningful, by itself.
For example, in time, we may discard an old idea for a new one - as we did en
masse, replacing Newton' universe with Einstein's.
I suggest that Natasha's statement about "training the brain" begins with
many excursions into thoughts that do not become concrete, as well as those
that do. This is an important part of that part of our creativity processor,
fermenting as it were, new and useless ideas into ones that may later bear
fruit.

You also  say that loose thinking equals insanity ( probably not very
defendable, but a common entropic thought, as is your hypothesis that artists
in general tend towards insanity more than other gropus, which is not
supported by any evidence  BTW). Can you show me how you came to this
conclusion?

Insanity has never been defined in that manner, and your first statement 
implies that it is an end result of free thinking.  Your 
following statement about artists pushing themselves over the edge 
implies that insanity can be voluntarily induced through excessively 
creative brain activity, thereby establishing a cause and effect 
scenario.  There exists no science to back up any of 
your statements, notwithstanding the progress of neuroscience in 
mapping areas that are prone to imbalance, and your statements only 
further the cultural mythos surrounding the artistic process.

In that it is considered to be a mystical happening ususally experienced by
artists while in some stream of consciousness state, I think that there is a
general trend towards admiring it from a distance. This the fallacy that I
am trying to address in this thread.  In order for us to expand our thinking
in multiple directions, adapting thinking patterns to develop more ceative
lateral thinking patterns would prove to be an excellent tool.

Let's talk "ideas."  Our ideas are what makes us unique.  Our transhuman
ideas are establishing a paradigm for others.  These ideas are necessary and
important, for they will become points on the compass into the future,
rather than going into the future pell mell.  There is value in seeing -
paying attention to - the creative act.  There is value in ideas.  There is
also value in putting ideas into action.

The skill of creative thinking just doesn't happen.  Although, one might
have an innate inclination towards being orginally creative, most people
have to work at it.

IAN: One way to know is to examine the evidence relative to police 
powers and the deployments thereof. Now it is NOT a matter of suspicion, 
excessive or otherwise,  that police powers are growing and that they 
are only growing. Legislation, such as the anti-terrorist bill, and court
rulings that give police more and more ability to conduct surreptitious
surveillance, to search properties and imprison people are increasing by 
leaps and bounds every year -- such is "police statism" by definition. 

I will submit to you that as these expanded police powers are not matters 
of conjecture,  but are matters of fact,  that to suggest that it is
"paranoid" to define such rapid and constant expansions of police power 
as "police statism" is contradicted absolutely by the facts. It is more
a question of do you care or not -- I do, it seems you don't.

Furthermore, to suggest that defining police statism as a "disease" is 
paranoid (if indeed that's what you suggest) is also unwarranted; yet, 
it is a matter of subjective interpretation: those who value the crushing
effects of excessive police -- i.e., governmental -- controls will not 
define a police state as a disease. 

As to the question of whether or not the expansion of police state 
powers is leading to excessive-police brutality, I suggest you examine 
the evidence you deleted. For example, the FLIR video of the events at 
Waco on April 19, 1993 provide compelling evidence, to say the least, 
that federal-police forces massacred women and children in cold blood 
as they attempted to escape the fire that the same video indicates was 
set by the FBI.  Dr. Edward F. Allard, an FLIR expert, gives us his 
expert analysis of the many muzzle flashes seen on the video: 

        There is no natural explanation for these flashes.
        Natural phenomena do not heat and cool in fractions 
        of a second. My expert opinion is that these flashes 
        appear to be the muzzle flashes of a fully automatic 
        firearm, firing at about 500 rounds per minute cyclic 
        rate. Carefully examined, in slow motion and by frame-
        to-frame observation, the flashes originate to the left
        and progress to the right, indicating that they are 
        being fired from a source outside the building, and 
        fired into the building. 

I have myself seen the FLIR video. I was amazed at the certainty with 
which one can determine that these are muzzle flashes. In one case you 
can even see heat radiate from the spent-cartridge discharger on the 
side of the firearm, which I appears to be a large M-60 machine gun.

I cannot imagine that anyone could define the cold-blooded slaughter and 
burning to death of innocent women and children as anything but the worst
expression of police statism. Even more than the FLIR, pathologists who 
did autopsies in the Waco case blame many deaths on the FBI tanks that 
plowed deep inside the building. See my web page that covers Waco for 
more details on this: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/facts.htm

Waco, while a most horrific example, is but a subset of a wider less
overwhelmingly aggressive, yet all-pervasive assault by the State on the
liberties, properties, and freedom of the American people. Every person 
sitting in a prison for a victimless crime is a victim of police statism. 
Every business shut down by regulators or prevented from ever existing 
due to onerous regulation and taxation are victims of police statism. 

We can try to define police statism out of existence if we choose -- but 
we do so at our own peril. I realize that in accord with the Extropian 
principle of Dynamic Optimism, awareness of police brutality is discouraged 
even to the point that those who seek to raise awareness are tarred as
"paranoid," i.e., mentally defective. I believe that excessive optimism 
can be as, or perhaps even more, detrimental to our future as a nation 
than excessive paranoia, which, short of proving that police powers are
decreasing, that Waco was not a massacre, etc... has not even been 
demonstrated to be the case here. 

I encourage people to examine the evidence against the ever-growing State. 
I submit that no case against Statism is complete minus a careful analysis 
of its crimes against the people. I submit further that cataloging these 
crimes is not a mental dysfunction, as we are encouraged believe by the
statist majority, but is an invaluble service to the future of 
freedom and human progress.

blending cognitive science and informed literary theory, is Mark Turner.
See a March 97 Discover review of his latest book at

In response: quote and footnote:

(For Foucault to be in error is not unprecedented.  Indeed, many historians
find empirically unsound such sensational Foucauldian claims as the genesis
of the madhouse in the emptied leprosarium, and the sequestration of the mad
on a literal Ship of Fools plying the Rhine.)16  

16.  A convenient summary of such errors, documented by Luc Ferry and Alain
Renaut, Andrew Scull, Erik Midelfort, Leon Radzinowicz, Michael Ignatieff,
Douglas Hay, and David Garland, is sketched in Keith Windschuttle, The
Killing of History (1994), pp. 145-54.  Instances of these empirical
mistakes include consequential errors in dating of a century or more.  Major
incarceration of the insane did not occur between 1650-1789 but 1815-1914,
making it `a product not of the era of the Enlightenment philosophes but
rather of the democratic era' (pp. 145-6).  Foucault makes similar blunders
with regard to the punishment or confinement of criminals (pp. 148-150).
Nor are these discrepancies trivial; their false data are what supports
Foucault's major `archaeological' and `genealogical' claims concerning the
purely social construction of subjectivity, and its abrupt discontinuities
across time.

Foucault offered new concepts that challenged people's assumptions about
prisons, the police, insurance, care of the mentally ill, gay rights, and
welfare.

Also, he offered new concepts for, ideas, creative concept and systems of
thought.

Foucault was influenced by Nietzsche.  He explored shifting pattern of
thinking, especially relating to power and self will.=20

To further this, I'll quote:

"Foucault's thinking developed through three stages. First, in Madness and
Civilization (1960), he traced how, in the Western world, madness=97which=
 was
once thought to be divinely inspired=97came to be thought of as mental
illness. In this book he attempted to expose the creative force of madness
that Western societies have traditionally repressed. In his second stage he
produced The Order of Things (1966), one of his most important works.

"Foucault's last period was inaugurated by the publication of Discipline and
Punish in 1975. It ostensibly questions whether imprisonment is a more
humane punishment than torture, but it is more generally concerned with the
way society orders individuals by training their bodies; for example, basic
training may discipline and prepare a person to be a soldier. Foucault's
last three books=97History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction (1976),=
 The
Use of Pleasure (1984), and The Care of the Self (1984)=97are parts of an
unfinished history of sexuality. In these books, Foucault follows the stages
by which people in Western societies have come to understand themselves as
sexual beings, and relates the sexual self-concept to the moral and ethical
life of the individual.

"In all the books of his last period Foucault seeks to show that Western
society has developed a new kind of power he calls bio-power=97that is, a=
 new
system of control that traditional concepts of authority are unable to
understand and criticize. Rather than being repressive, this new power
enhances life.=20

I'm not an expert on Foucault, however I appreciate his use of logic in
creative thinking.  Ideas, creative concepts and systems of thought.
Extropic thinking?

        The best book I have ever read that deals with the nature of art is
called "Art Objects."  It is a collection of essays by Jeanette Winterson
that deal with the association of art to the artist and the viewer as well
as the latency of every individual's ability to be art and create art.
Definitely an automorphic book.  Its ISBN is 0-679-76820-3 and is published
by Vintage international.  Highly recommended!

        Kudos to Max More for doing a stellar job of conveying the general
extropian view on cloning.  He dispelled the theistic ideas that cloning
is against God's Will, not to mention the nature vs. science meme; in
addition, he defined the individual consciousness that each clone will
acquire.  Throughout the interview, he made numerous allusions to more
effective technologies that, as extropians, we seem to find commonplace.

        The problem with the program itself was that the interview was
interspersed with primordial footage regarding cloning which, in effect,
took away from the ideas that Max was conveying.  Also, the cinematographer
seemed to find it humorous to section the screen, making it appear that Max
was "cloned" on the television set.  But all in all, the content of the
interview was of a very high quality, and I'm sure that
all who watched the program have found a new way to perceive cloning, if not
technology itself. 


                                        Job Well Done!

        Right on.  I seem to take it for granted that the only way to
achieve something is to kineticize my potential or shift latency into
action.  This principle is the underlying (and often unacknowledged)
motivation of art.  Anything that anyone does to create anything is art.
What culturally defines an artist is "one who applies emotion to a medium;"
I personally call this a corporeal artist.  Everyone is an artist in some
way or another (I seem to recall David Musick explaining that the way he
washes dishes or combs his hair fascinates him simply because he is
*creating* something) though most don't make their artistry into a
marketable form.

        Natasha is absolutely correct when she says that "Our ideas are what
make us unique."  I don't think anyone on this list can challenge that
statement.  We all think differently, talk differently, walk differently,
act differently et cetera, and that is something to feel proud of.  That is art.
That is attainable.  Take it; mold it; feel it; taste it; love it, for it is
*yours* to create and enjoy, and everyone else's to respect and appreciate.

He also developed the concept of 'limit experience', something that 
greatly informed his own life.  Limit experience involves pushing the 
boundaries of physical and emotional experience through various types 
of experimentation, with the purpose of exploring the lines between 
life/death, sanity/madness, normal/abnormal.  He spent part of the last 
ten years of his life traveling anonymously through the Western US, 
particularly San Francisco, pursuing experiences.  Not even his lover 
knows fully what he did here in the States.  Anything he wrote about 
it other than the brief mentions in published essays was probably 
destroyed along with all the other notes Foucalt ordered destroyed after 
his death.  That saddens me, as I find great personal resonance with 
that aspect of his work.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I agree with that there are cases where madness can be led back to medical
arguments. (in the case later caused damage, not of genetical arguments
against people who are fully 'functional' otherwise) 

I agree with that foucaults definitions of madness can't be explained from
a purely social point of view, allthough i'd put the blame on nation states
rather than just democracies seen the examples that occurred after 1914 in
non-democratic states.  

I also agree that for examples involving homosexuals long after 1914, other
arguments can be found than purely social ones. 

I just hope those arguments will not be used to limit individual freedom.

A) Homosexuality, and other behaviour that is or was once considered a
'deviation' can be led back 'somewhat' to genetical influence.

B) Criminal behaviour can also.

I'd like to think that the second we are born into this world, we become an
individual, influencing the effect that code will have on us, whatever our
genetical 'deviations' may be. And that our genetical influences can be
overcome, SHOULD WE WISH THAT. Based on individual choice, for all cases
where our behaviour is not damaging to others (A is not, B is).

Problems like these still exist today in the case of pedofilian
relationships. It all depends on our points of view on when we accept
individuals (note: not agegroups, individual cases) to be responsible
enough to take their own decisions. 

Another example are gender 'deviations' and our societies pressure to make
them conform to the two sexes system. (horrible medical stories!)

Then again they're not my problem, so why should i worry about them, right
? ;-)
