Not true. The bill referred to here, H.R. 3103, the Health Insurance
Portability Bill, became Public Law 104-191 on August 21, 1996. In April,
the bill was still being debated, and considerable changes occurred to it

Not true! There was no such "Rider". HR 3103, as it was originally
introduced, contained highly ambiguous fraud language that posed a threat to
alternative medical practitioners, however this language was removed due to
a major lobbying effort by Life Extension Foundation and numerous allies.
The bill, as it passed, does not pose a threat to alternative medicine. In
fact, by requiring insurance companies to reimburse for preexisting
conditions, many feel that it HELPS alternative medicine because insurance
companies are now beginning to reimburse for alternative treatments in an
effort to keep costs down. An article of mine which discusses this in detail
was just published in the December issue of Life Extension Magazine. It
appears on p.40 of the December issue and is titled "Insurance Companies
Reimburse for Alternative Medicine"

There was no such "rider." This is simply not true! The German proposal
currently before the Codex Alimentarius Commission IS a serious problem, but
what is stated here about a "rider" connecting it to HR 3103 is simply not
true! I recently returned from the Codex meeting in Bonn Germany, and wrote
an article about the proceedings which I am sending in an attached file. The
Codex threat to health freedom IS genuine, and I AM concerned about it, VERY
concerned, but it hinders my efforts when people disseminate misinformation.
Please help me in correcting this situation so that people will have an
accurate understanding of what is going on.

Can someone out there please tell me who runs "SPIRAL"? Can someone please

*** British scientists back life on Mars theory

British astronomers said Thursday they had found evidence to back U.S.
space scientists' reports that they had found traces of life in a
meteorite from Mars. The British scientists said samples from two
separate Martian meteorites showed definite traces that could have
been left by living organisms. One was recent enough to indicate that
there still could be life surviving somewhere on Mars. That sample
contained traces of a carbon isotope that is often formed by
microscopic life forms on Earth. For the full text story, see

Why is this obvious? As I love to point out, it is just a matter of how

I prefer to define myself as a system that honestly thinks it is me.

Actually, this isn't sophistry, just some weird ontology. If you buy into 
platonic materialism, then by the No Clone Theorem a perfect emulation 
(probably quantum.by-wantum) would *be* you in a strict ontological 
sense.

I see your argument, but it isn't based in information theory, rather 
(information-) ontology. 

The big problem in this debate is that we always confuse numerical 
identity with ontological identity and personal identity. They do not 
need to be equivalent.

Actually, if I encode a message in something (say a disk or a hydrogen
atom), I can move it around quite well without copying it. Information
doesn't seem to be able to exist on its own, it needs to be encoded in
something since it is a pattern.

Even if we would accept your argument, it wouldn't make uploading 
impossible. It would just make some of us more reluctant to try it, while 
others wouldn't care. 

The big question I have, is information == consciousness? Or consciousness
a property of information (processing)? Or something else?  Big question,
hard to answer.

My experiences agree quite well with this, I also feel like a society of 
subsystems from time to time. One of the more fascinating ways of 
liberating your creativity is to call them to a meeting and brainstorm.

I wouldn't call them personalities, I prefer subminds, since most lack 
clear personality (although they might develop it). By concentrating on 
them, naming them and thinking of them they can become more individual.

As I see it, it is an useful exercise to tear down the illusion of "one 
mind in one brain", it gives you a much healthier view of yourself and 
your behavior. At the same time, it is important to be able to cohere 
into a single being too when needed - maybe one could develop exercises 
for this?

My guess is that posthuman beings will be constructed in roughly the same 
way, although the subminds may be of human or greater intelligence and 
contain subsubminds, and so on.

A very good definition. I usually define something as "disease" or 
"unhealth" if it limits the victim's possibilities - if it instead 
enhances them it is good.

In reply to my statement, 

:: A marijuana garden in a mansion in Beverly Hills

Good point.  I had forgotten about that incident.  

This reminds me of something that happened in Berkeley about 
1970 or 71.  The cops raided a house in the Berkeley hills.  A woman 
and her son were sitting quietly in the living room, watching TV.  
CRASH #1 -- the police smashed the door with a battering ram.  
CRASH #2 -- the chandelier fell to the floor and shattered into a million 
pieces.  A dozen cops swarmed through the house with drawn guns, 
and found no one except the woman and her son, who were not amused.  
The cops had come to the wrong address.  The next day, the chief of 
police had the unpleasant task of going to see this lady and her husband, 
and apologizing.  As I heard the story at the time, the pig's ears burned 
for weeks afterward.  These people were in a position to call an idiot 
an idiot and get away with it.  

Nevertheless, the cops did raid a house in the hills, and if it had been 
the right house, there would have been no apologies.  

Even billionaires are not entirely above the law (as Michael Jackson 
and Michael Milken both found out).  

I think the man you refer to who got shot lived in Pacific Palisades, 
which is a beautiful area, and a good place to conceal a garden, but 
not quite the kind of neighborhood I had in mind.  

There are some houses in Beverly Hills where such a raid would be 
almost impossible.  The cops would have to use a tank to get in the 
front gate.  In some parts of Beverly Hills, the Hollywood hills, and 
outlying areas such as Palm Springs, all kinds of outrageous things 
go on, but the cops seldom get involved unless somebody gets killed 
(as in "American Gigolo").   In these areas, the neighbors aren't 
going to be reporting drug activity, because they can't see over the wall.  
Besides, in these areas the neighbors aren't the kind of people who 
would report drug activity to the police even if they knew about it.  
They respect each other's privacy.  

The question is whether it is possible to have a nark-free neighborhood 
without spending $20 million for an estate in the hills or the desert.  

There is an entirely different way to approach this.

This is a strange and subtle idea:  a miracle with a causal explanation.  
In what sense is it a miracle?  

Here is an example.  In 1989 I met Leslie Graves, my favorite pin-up 
girl, and eventually she became my (more or less voluntary) sex slave.  
Does this qualify as a miracle?  I would say so.  It doesn't contradict 
the laws of physics, but it is an extremely rare and wondrous event, 
and it was something I had concentrated on and anticipated for years. 

Another possible example, which will bring us back to our subject:  
Twenty years ago, cigarette smoke was ubiquitous.  If someone had 
said, in 1976, that there would be a time when smoking would be 
illegal in all restaurants in Los Angeles, and entire shopping malls 
would be smoke-free, most people would have thought they were 
crazy.  And yet, here we are.  I think this qualifies as a miracle in 
Hara Ra's sense. 

Twenty years from now, there may be marijuana plants growing 
on the White House lawn.  This seems impossible now, but 
no more impossible than the idea of smoke-free malls in 1976.  
Miracles do happen.  

There are also examples of people who have gone through the midst of 
war -- the war on drugs or any other war -- and emerged without a 
scratch, while everyone around them was getting cut to pieces.  
This too is a "miracle" which is compatible with causality.  

I am not wedded to the idea of focusing on money.  Being rich is 
one way to have freedom, but not the only way, and not necessarily 
the best way.  The best way to deal with the DEA is simply(!) 
to make it disappear.  Imagine a nark-free world, and walk into 
that reality.  Miracles require absolute forgetfulness...  Miracles also, 
paradoxically, require a deep understanding of causality (but not 
necessarily an articulate understanding).  

E. Shaun Russell quotes George Bernard Shaw as follows:  

> The men who dream at night do just that --dream, 
> but the men who dream at day are the ones who can 
> turn their dreams into reality. 

What about men who have lucid dreams in the daytime?

We know quite well about what regions are involved at the lower levels,
according to Henrik there is a group of nuclei in the brainstem that
regulate sleep and activate dreaming. They do such things as cut off
sensory input and motor output, and send out the PNO-wave
(Pontine-something-Occipital wave) that activate the cortex. If there is
any interest, I'll try to force him to tell me more...

Lyle said "Maybe that's a sacred cow -- I always assume that there is a cause

think I would be willing to question."

I agree with you that looking for the causes of things is a good way to 
understand how things work.  However, I wonder why you are unwilling to 
question this.  Questioning something does not mean that you are denying it, 
saying it is incorrect.  It simply means you are probing deeper into the 
subject, so that you can understand it better.  My experience has shown me 
that questioning my beliefs is always beneficial, even very basic beliefs.  If 
they are valid and worthwhile beliefs, then the process of questioning tends 
to strengthen them, and if they are invalid or have errors, then the process 
of questioning reveals that to me, and I seek to correct my flawed beliefs.  
Questioning my beliefs has always been very educational for me, and engaging 
in that activity helps me clarify my thinking, so that I become a more 
powerful and accurate thinker.

I think that if you questioned your notions of causality you would gain a 
better understanding of why you think that way, and perhaps your questioning 
will help you gain some truly deep insights into the nature of causality.

A bad idea's worst fear is to be questioned, for then it will be seen for what 
it truly is.

A good idea's greatest desire is to be questioned, for then it will be seen

Here is the problem: how to program the 'wizard' to make the organs? That 
is a very nontrivial challenge (trust me, I have just been at an anatomy 
lecture - there are embedded controllers and brilliant tricks just about 
everywhere!). 

Designing an organism (say a dragon) from scratch is equivalent to having
a genie machine that you can tell "Build a working spaceship!". It
requires quite a bit of intelligence, although it might manage with
"evolutionary intelligence" if it has enough brute force computing power
(to make that dragon, it would have to do millions of years of evolution
in a reasonable span of time, down to the genetic scale!). 

I'm not saying it is impossible, just quite hard. Modular lifeforms might 
make things easier, but life is still very complicated business.

Interesting. Yes, there are many kinds. As far as I know, they might even 
have different causes and ways of functioning - the divisions could exist 
on different levels.

Yes and no. I would of course add this kind of optimization (why simulate
miles of pointless rock at the planetary core at the same resolution as
the surface dwellers' brains?), but it won't solve the main problem: such
a world would be inherently computationally expensive. We cannot compress
it beyond its Kolmogoroff complexity (the shortest program that generates
it at a certain timeslice), and by definition, being an interesting and
comparably complex world, it would have a complexity comparably to our
own. 

I somewhat envy the protagonists in _Permutation City_, who have 
literally unlimited computing power...

Until I get my neutron star computer, I plan to make small worlds.

True. But what I'm looking for is not technology, I want knowledge (and a 
certain amount of wisdom). We cannot predict what is to be learned or 
developed beforehand (otherwise we would know it already), but I bet it 
will be interesting and beautiful!

The topic of getting a computer virus through one's e-mail was brought up and 
then discredited, and then Ian Goddard asked, "What about a file attached to 
an email ?  These files are loaded
onto my hardrive like any file, and a virus, as I understand, is basicaly an 
exe file. As far as I can see, one of those attached files can be an exe virus 
file. How is this not so?"

You are right, Ian, a virus could be in an attached executable (.exe) file.  
But it is nothing more than data until your computer actually runs it AS an 
executable file.  A virus can't infect your computer without being run by your 
computer.  So, yes, you can receive a virus through your e-mail, but it will 
be completely dormant until it is run as an executable program.  You can 
examine the virus with various software programs and figure out its exact 
sequence of 1's and 0's, but until you actually RUN the thing, it is 
completely harmless.

          Yes, but now I am no longer sure exactly what the definition 
          (analysis) you propose is. It would be helpful if you could 
          express it in the form:
          
          x is art if, and only if, x ---.
          
          What you write in place of the "---" should be (1) clear 
          (ideally a physical formula, but that is obviously beyond 
          reach in this case), (2) informative (e.g. not --- = "is 
          art"), and (3) agree with the notion you are trying to 
          define (no counterexamples).
          
          If you are not out for a conceptual analysis but rather for 
          an explication, then condition (3) can be somewhat relaxed 
          but there will be a new condition to consider: (4) the 
          explicandum should be interesting or useful.

          You bet. I'm not knowledgable in the phil of art, however. 
          My guess is that some kind of concensus might have emerged 
          that the notion of art is a so called family concept, so 
          that no consise definition is possible. But then again, 
          maybe there is an essential core that you could think out -I 
          believe, for example, that I have discovered a nice 
          explication of the notion of a paranormal phenomenon (like 
          true psychokinesis etc.)
          
          >What are the philosophers doing these days, anyway?
          
          All sorts of things, except thinking about the future. One 
          exception is John Leslie with his recent book The End of the 
          World. I believe, however, that his main argument is flawed.

(Using an atomic scale monitor is hi-fi overkill, you get a resolution 
smaller than the wavelength of visible light)

First, I would like to point out the work that has been done with
custom-designed proteins and artificial enzymes; thats what nanotech is
about, and the area shows great promise (and uses genengineering to get
there too). I read about (Science News a few years back) a change in a
bacterial protein that made it create small (20 atoms) crystals of
uranium. 

Secondly, I would like to point out that there is a qualitative difference
between the gears, wires and enzymes and the gene: we have reasonable
control over the former, but we cannot use the genes to do very complex
things. The cell is a nightmare of tangled interactions, where proteins
switch on and off genes producing other proteins that are marked by
enzymes becoming active making the cell do one thing and then switching on
another switch making the cell produce morphogens that influence the
neighbors to change their behavior... we can control a few genes we know
have rather direct effects (like eye color and trombine production), but
making cells differentiate and grow into something we want that isn't
already coded somewhere is extremely nontrivial (i.e. nearly impossible)
at present. We can make crippled fruit flies, but not a fruit fly that
likes meat or have butterfly wings.

The tobacco plant was a single gene, each cell expressed it (which is a 
waste, but who cares?), and the light emission didn't involve anything 
more complex than watering it with the right catalyst. 

The geep is more interesting, but wasn't it just a chimerical being (cells
of two types)? Anyway, it is just a combination and its creators didn't
have any special new properties in mind when it was created - it would be
something completely different to make (say) a goat with feathers.

         BEIJING, Oct 31 (Reuter) - China hopes for a breakthrough in  
manned spaceflights early next century and hopes to land a 
spacecraft on the moon in the 21st century, the Xinhua news 
agency said on Thursday. 
         The ambitious space programme was aimed at giving China a  
competitive edge in international space development, Xinhua 
said, quoting senior officials. 
         Manned spaceflights are being given top priority in the  
space programme, which includes building a heavy solar satellite 
in partnership with Germany as well as building a new generation 
of lightweight spacecraft to 'bus' satellites into orbit, Xinhua 
said. 
         ``The country is expected to make a breakthrough in manned  
space technology at the beginning of the next century,'' Xinhua 
said, quoting Wang Liheng, vice-administrator of the China 
National Space Administration. 
         China was working on technologies badly needed for moon  
exploration to provide cheap transport systems for lunar-landing 
spacecraft so as to explore the moon and to develop lunar 
resources, it said.

The way I (and I would say Vinge) uses the word, it refers to a hostile 
or at least involuntary takeover. The reasons might be benign, as in "True 
Names", but it is still something that the owners of the resources 
haven't agreed on.

Note that you base this on the word "frequently", which is a doubtful
assumption (do we have any data on how computer intrusion "usually"
happens?). Usually these clever ideas are creative and involve
non-computer tools such as physical break in, phone calls to trick users
into revealing information or the ability to look through discarded
documentation. In a future information-dominated world, this would be
simpler, but security would also be higher.

The problem is that the SI cannot use the systems 100%, since that would 
be too obvious and they would be shut down. So it would have a lot of 
computers running very small processes of itself, with noticeable delays 
over the net - this would limit it considerably. And it would have a hard 
time keeping track of all the risks: one system administrator who 
discovers the SI infiltration could do it a lot of harm if he (for 
example) call other administrators and they agree on shutting down their 
systems or spread a "viruskiller". 

Actually, I have been thinking of making a computer or strategy game of 
this SI scenario; the players are SI's trying to take over the internet 
and transcend.

:-) Fortunately, my password is not that simple. It is guessable, but you 
have to make some odd intuitive leaps and do some research to get it. But 
as you point out, there are big holes in many systems. But are they 
enough to provide a base for an useful SI in a reasonable time?

I see where our fundamental disagreement is. You say we have memories, 
thoughts and feelings; I say we ARE memories, thoughts and feelings. You say 
we are an object, a noun. I say we are an adjective, we are the way matter 
reacts when it is organized in certain ways. True, matter is needed for us to
exist, but that's not the important part because any matter will do, good 
thing too, the matter in your body is quite different than it was a year ago. 
The important thing is the way the matter is organized, the information.   
         
Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the soul  
and still remain within the scientific method.  
Consider the similarities:

1) The soul is non material and so is information.  

2) It's difficult to pin down a unique physical position for the soul, and 
   the same is true for information. Exactly where is the location of the 
   information that Caesar was a Roman or that 2 +2 =4 ?  

3) The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness, exactly the 
   same situation is true for information.  

4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.  
    

There are also important differences between the soul and information:  


1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  

2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is 
   understandable, in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is 
   understandable.

3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that,  
   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.
                                                            


                   >your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain. 
                     

To say that consciousness is in our brain is like saying speed is in a 
particular racing car and if we just look close enough we'll find it lurking 
someplace in the machinery, thus another car moving at the exact same 
velocity  must nevertheless have a different speed because the same speed 
can't be in two places at once. Obviously this doesn't work, I realize speed 
is just a scalar and mind has a huge number of variables, but if it doesn't 
work in the  simple case making it more complex won't help.  
                    

                >All you are doing by uploading is spawning a second thread 
                >of consciousness that thinks it is you.                  
                  

So I don't really survive I just think I do? That's good enough for me 
because  if I think I've survived then I have. It's like those old Twilight 
Zones when at the end the hero is horrified to discover that he's really dead, 
even as a kid I never understood that, I'd be astounded and delighted to 
discover I was dead because that would mean death wasn't all it was cracked
up to be.             

                >The uploaded brain would have every reason to think it was                 
                >you because every memory tells it that it is you.
                        

Yes, the upload would certainly believe that he was you, and I can find no  
reason to think he would be wrong.

Yes, very soon the two would start to diverge because of random factors and 
the fact that they would receive different input data from the environment, 
but that doesn't change the fact that at the instant the second original was 
made the two were identical. I should add that every day things happen to you 
that make your consciousness evolve in a completely different direction than 
it otherwise would, and this has nothing to do with copies.  
                   

                >Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.
                 

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Information can be copied and information 
can (probably) be destroyed by sending it through a non reversible computer 
or dropping a floppy disk into a Black Hole. If information no longer exists 
at point A but now exists at point B it sure sounds to me like it moved.    
                 

                >The problem with the human brain is that we are more or less

The easiest way to do an upload is the paint by numbers approach, replace  
each neuron with something much smaller and faster. To do this you'd need to 
have a good understanding about neurons operate but you wouldn't need to know 
how the brain as a whole operates. As you point out this is very limiting, 
a billion fold increase in speed and immortality is about all we could expect 
from it. To design something better we'd need to understand how intelligence 
operates, and that could be enormously difficult. It could take uploads  
100,000 years of vigorous research to figure it out, that's about an hour 
in our time.

Last night I was thinking about "Casper the friendly cryonicist".
Sometimes a negative type (eg frozen heads or ghosts) can be made
postive by creating a nice and likeable but misunderstood character of
that type.  People then identify with the misunderstood part.  Kids
choose halloween characters the identify with and like in some way.
So creating a misunderstood frozen head halloween character could be a
good thing.

John Mackie, a twentieth-century Australian (I think) philosopher,
wrote a book on causality called THE CEMENT OF THE UNIVERSE. I
haven't read it yet, but I've read a couple of Mackie's other books.
He is a clear thinker and a skilled writer, though a bit philosophically
orthodox for my tastes. It's on my reading list, and I intend to
pick it up next time I have a nice period of time in which I can
afford the luxury of seriously questioning causality.

Many people confuse READING a virus executable with EXECUTING a virus 
executable.  Every virus contains a trigger that *requires* the 
execution of the file.  Files don't normally execute by themselves.  
In the case of email, it would require the recipient explicitly 
executing this file after it was saved to the hard drive.  The act of 
saving the file to the hard drive does not pose any immediate threat.  
Only if the virus is activated does it become a problem.

The exception:   

Some applications contain macro languages that can cause damage if 
read from a file, instead of being executed.  Viruses designed this 
way usually have limited capability, and are not really viruses by 
definition.  Postscript documents are an example of read-only files 
that can contain destructive instructions to the application they run 
under.  There is also a somewhat famous one that runs under MS Word.

Bottom line is don't execute an executable unless you know what it 
is.

Yes, but I think that most people here want to *experience* the 
upload, not generate a bunch of clones who *think* they were 
uploaded.  In a destructive upload, our stream of consciousness would 
cease to exist.  We would be dead and there would be a computer 
program running that would swear it was us, and would in fact be us, 
albeit running on a separate stream of consciousness.  I don't think 
too many people would terminate their own stream of consciousness to 
create new independant ones.  What would be the advantage?

You are only moving the substrate upon which the information is 
encoded.  Information itself cannot be moved because it has no 
physical properties.  When I say move, I mean move from one substrate 
to another.  The physical translation of information from one point in space 
to another is meaningless in an information context.

The problem of saying that information can be moved is that it allows 
the spontaneous creation of information.  If this was the case, a cat 
could "spontaneously" derive and understand the Schroedinger 
wave equations without having the slightest concept of physics or 
math.
 
For information to exist it must be encoded.  This *requires* that 
information can only be copied or destroyed.  "New" information is 
only the reorganization of existing information into a format that is 
meaningful to us.  Even our imaginations are constrained by the limits of 
our experience.

If I am not mistaken, the "Information can not be moved, only copied" 
theorem has been proven mathematically.  Unfortunately, this reflects 
the strong entropic property  of information.

I am not saying it is impossible to upload; it is impossible only in 
the sense of uploading a single, existing stream of consciousness as opposed to 
creating a new stream of consciousness.

This, of course, IS the big question.  If consciousness is based upon 
information and information processing, my above statements hold.  If 
not, then everything I said becomes irrelevant to the question.

Personally, I believe that consciousness is a result of the 
architecture of our information storage and processing systems.  If 
this was not the case, we would be delving into the fuzzy world of 
metaphysics.

You would have to execute the attached program in order for it to do
anything.  If it is a virus infected executable, then executing it would
most likely cause your system to become infected.  If it is a
destructive program disguized as something useful, and doesn't replicate
itself, then it's a trojan horse, not a virus.  Either way, it requires
your active involvement to do anything.

It is possible, however, for some kinds of executable code in a file
attachment to execute automatically upon receipt.  Some email software
can recognize document types and then launch an appropriate application
to load the document.  If the document is a type that can contain
executable code (MS Word files with programs written in Word's macro
language are a notorious example), then it is indeed possible for a
virus or trojan to load and execute automatically.  It all just depends
on what software you are using and how you have it set up.

Also I began thinking further, we should simply upload all our brains to a
'super meaty brain'! We could copy all our brains to a 'super meaty' brain
which has been engineered to support many consciousnesses and you'd be
jacked into a virtual world w/AI helpers. ou inside the meaty brain would
be the 'real' one and you could use your subconscious for multitasking or
spur AI duplicates of yourself. You could also send out and embody AI
agents at other solar systems to colonize. We can also be moved from super
meaty brain to super meaty brain by nano streams running between each of
the meaty brains. You could also control animals or other biological drone
bodies by remote control via a box in the drone's head acting as a PC-Brain
interface.

Why not come up with a bio/silicon brain which contains bits of both so as
to speed up the whole. Both bio and silicon both have their pros so why not
add both together and make one dual medium (dm) brain.

Speed is a property of a race car.  There can be many instances of a 
race car, each with its own speed.  
Same thing applies to the brain.  Consciousness is a property of the 
brain.   There can be many instances of a single brain, each with its 
own consciousness.

You wouldn't think at all.  If the upload was destructive, you would be 
dead.  Only the uploaded clone would think it was you.  You would 
cease to exist and all we would have is a computer that contains a 
specific instance of you.  *Your* instance would have been terminated 
by the upload.

Exactly.  The upload is you, but it is a different instance of you.

A lot of people seem to be tripping up on this.  This is an extremely 
common misperception.  It wasn't until I was studying information 
theory that I figured this thing out.  It's application to uploading 
didn't occur to me until a couple days ago.

Information does not exist in the physical universe.  Information is 
only encoded on objects that exist in the physical universe.  For 
information to exist, it must be encoded on a substrate.  If every 
piece of substrate containing a specific piece of information is 
destroyed, the information is destroyed permanently. 

Because information does not exist physically, a physical translation 
in space of the substrate is irrelevant.  Moving information is to 
copy the encoded information from one substrate to another.  Physical 
proximity does not matter.

What most people *really* mean when they say information has been 
moved is:
1)  The substrate containing the information has been physically 
moved, or

2)  a copy of the information was made on a different substrate, and 
the information on the originating substrate was destroyed after the 
copy was made.

You can't move the information from Floppy Disk A to Floppy Disk B 
without making a copy.  It isn't possible.

Even if we were able to understand how 
intelligence operates,  is it possible to "reorganize" or extend the 
architechture of the brain without causing changes in consciousness?  
It may be my own limitations, but I can't help but think that 
although our intelligence could be extended fairly easily, our 
consciousness is irremovably tied to the overall structure of our 
brain.

Force him! This would be the *perfect* place to insert a brain-computer
interface although you would stand of risk of perminantly paralyzing the
person if you did it wrong.

With faster brains imagine how that would change our society and social
skills. Unless you had nanites, your body wouldn't be able to keep up with
your brain so you'd need to slow it down. Someone could then ask you a
question and you could set your brain into ultrafast thinking mode and
ponder it for a few thousand years, sum it up into a sentence and answer
the question. More would be accomplished in one second then in the entire
history of the human race.

Take a look at dreams! In a dream state, you can lower your access level to
information in your brain such as the concept of being in a house in a
dream and your brain 'knows' whats in the room you're about to enter but
you yourself do not which provides evidence for memory and consciousness
being two seporate functions.

But you can take the magnetic media on the inside of the floppy casing and
move it physically to the inside of another floppy case.

This is why incrememtal gradual uploading is required so that you 'grow'
into your new brain by writing new data into it. You would be required to
be functioning normally while the uploading is occurring so that you
maintain your consciousness through the trip. Static uploads cause clones.
After the upload is entirely complete you could shut down the manual
sensory input and kick back in VR paradise.

Possible or at least add a pinch of dynamic optimism to each. Problem is
that people are attracted to Entropy with doom and gloom. It's only bad
when they're experiencing it. People love to see disaster from a distance
but don't like it when the disaster is happening to them. This is the same
way humor works with people making fun of an individual but not liking it
when people make fun of them.

Possible, but you still have to consider Amdahl's law.  The actual 
speed increase will be far less than you expect as long as you still 
have tissue components.  Tissue, although massively parallel, has 
some severe latency problems.  It would represent a serious 
bottleneck for any sequential processing.

Human nature is deeper than MBA-speak.

The implied ideology behind a "WE ARE ALL SELF-EMPLOYED" meme, is
that the natural metaphor for human relationships is commerce.

The problem is getting the right genes into your iris cells; normally 
gene therapy uses retroviruses or adenoviruses to infect cells and insert 
the genes, but I don't think there are any suitable viruses for eyes. But 
it should be quite possible to fix the eyes of your child if it is 
conceived in vitro. 

But you can use the fact that blue eyes are just brown eyes sans melanine,
perhaps you could design something that kills off the melanine-containing
cells of the iris, and get blue eyes (or red albino eyes - oops!). 
Somehow, I think colored contact lenses are less trouble right now...

This is probably the best way. Now we just need a good nanite design and 
the knowhow to make the bacteria.

No, and it is usually linked to other personality problems. "Normal" MPS 
is hardly anything I would want; I prefer the transhuman version 
(MPE, Multiple Personality Enhancement?).

For a fictional treatment of MPE, see Walter John William's _Aristoi_, 
where practically all people have AI-supported independent 
subpersonalities doing multitask work.

Perhaps commerce is the natural metaphor for relationships with
human beings from outside one's immediate local culture. Considering
the unsavory nature of most of the metaphors that many people in
the world still resort to for their exorelationships, perhaps
propagating the "commerce is natural" meme would be a big step
forward.

Of course, if you only hang out with fully-enlightened people, it
would be (possibly) a step backward. But if you only hang out with
enlightened people, then you *are* alienated from the human race.
No one is born enlightened.

Pushing the idea that your natural relationship with all the billions
of people in the world that you do not and cannot know is commercial
says nothing about your relationships with the people that you can
and do know. Obviously those can be much more flexible and deeper.
If you honestly wish to relate to your closest friends and relatives
only on the same terms that you could relate to a stranger from
Uruguay, then I think you're robbing yourself of opportunities for
satisfying relationships with other human beings.

I don't think there are many doctors who believe that "it is superstitious, 
immoral, WRONG to take vitamins"; BUT, there are still a lot of doctors who 
believe that health management is too complex for the average person to 
handle without a doctor's guidance.  Therefore, they are opposed to people 
being able to take supplements and medication off the shelf.

What can we do about it?  Well, the trend away from private practice toward 
managed care is already doing a lot about it.  Insurance companies are 
unlikely to pay for a visit to the doctor if all you want is some vitamins 
or other supplements.

The confusion found in early myths may be a function of the methods of
storytelling prevelent in that era, rather than confusion about the stories
themselves. Certain cultures regard myth as power, and therefore only
release certain details in any single account, either to society as a whole,
or to individuals, who are expected to form their own myth versions as they
mature. Furthermore, myths can be deliberately 'mutated' to produce flawed
versions which allow maintenance of a power base amongst those who have the
'true' version.

This explanation of lack of clarity would be confirmed if the creation and
cosmos mythologies were created contemporaneously, and if knowledge of the
creation myth could be shown to endow an individual with more 'power' or
'kudos' than the cosmology myths.

The creation myths may become more clear if analysed from a structuralist
perspective, a la Levi-Strauss, whereby meta-narrative is created by finding
parallels of constructive device and key role assignments within the various
forms of the myth.

Just an idea.

WE should decide what WE want! If we take medications which shouldn't be
mixed and kill ourselves, it's OUR DAMN FAULT! We should look for the
information ourselves. There are too many people for our government to take
care of. Now we must take care of ourselves. Think of it this way: People
who don't research the medications they're about to take and get fatal side
effects deserved it! We cannot be responsible for everyone and protect
people from themselves! And there is one nice side effect to this whole
thing! This process filters out all the stupid people who didn't think
before they acted and thus died. 

I am now prepared to get responses from people calling me 'heartless'.

Are you speaking of the concept of a person playing multiple roles? Such as
a 45 year old lawyer using a virtual world like WorldsChat could be a 18
year old blonde hair blue eyed girl who likes the beach or a 20 year old
brn hair brn eyed stud who is into snow boarding? This appears to be what
you're talking about and if it is, I know the concept quite well. If this
_is_ that you're discussing I've always wanted to have multiple
personalities but I also wished I had the bodies I could attach them with
which is why I would feel liberated in an uploaded or even merely VR world
or hell! maybe even nano world where you could actually convert your
physical mass into any form you wished!

Yes, although I _like_ the trader principle as a guide to interactions with
people we care little about, and even
*some*interactions that we do with loved ones, 
because we often need to step back and regain our
autonomy, the trader principle to me *alone*is a bit
grim, and emotionally bereft. It lacks a connective

of intimacy.

They were coming from the old idea that the public wanted "better safe than

ups of the past.  Those mess ups got them in to hot water with the "approved
drugs" that caused birth defects.  The public panicked and politically
correct congress slapped the FDA with all sorts of trouble for not being
harsh enough.

The FDA was not reading the public wind right with vitamins.  So they got
slapped again, this time from the public, for being too harsh.  You just
can't win when you try to regulate something.

The USP regulations for prescription drugs is a lot more expensive than the
USP regulations for OTC nutritional supplements.  The profit might drop
because of this if vitamins were under the Rx drug regulations.  Every year
the OTC regulations seem to get more expensive.

My pharmaceutical clients could make and sell vitamins right now.  Yet, they
do not make any vitamins.  Why?  They assume the FDA would place the same
expensive regulations on their OTC vitamins as on their Rx drugs despite the
USP.  And, they could not charge higher prices to offset the cost.  So, they
choose not to make any OTC vitamins.    If all vitamins were Rx, that could
change.

<<   They can make a lot more money selling vitamins over the 
 counter than they would make selling them by prescription.    >>

I am unclear if this is true or not.  Let's see:  Generic Rx makes a lot of
profit but only if the drug is unusual or hard to make and therefore, there
is less competition from other generics.  So, I guess if vitamins are easy to
make even under Rx regulations there would probably still be more competition
and less profit than selling them OTC.  You are probably right.  

The innovators (patent holders) would be out of the picture, because there
are none for vitamins.

That is the first step, I have a transhumanist friend who actually has 
developed three "interface" personalities to deal with different roles. 

A deeper version would be different *real* personalities that you can 
shift between as needed, perhaps with different skills and worldviews. It 
would also be useful if they could co-exist mentally, to give advise and 
discuss problems. 

The last possibility is closest to _Aristoi_: the daimons (as the
subpersonalities are called) have different roles and skills. For example,
Gabriel (the protagonist) has a logical and scientifically minded daimon
called Horus, Spring Rain is manipulative and social while Psyche is pure
poetry. So when Gabriel wants to develop a nanosystem, he puts Horus on
the job while he, helped by Spring Rain, converses with some VIPs and
another daimon deals with incoming mail.

As I said, emotions are the logic of values.

I say:
Umm, how about "emotions are how we *sense* values."?
I consider that discovering a feeling that surprises me provides a 
clue that I have a value I didn't know I had. Like noticing a funny 
smell in the room. I can then choose what to do about that. If the 
smell is one I'd like to experience more of, one set of activities 
might ensue; if I'd rather not experience it, other activities might 
be more appropriate.

Steve sez:
When people say that emotions are bad sources of information,
what I understand to be going on is this: one part of their value system
is telling me it doesn't like the urgings of other parts.  The person
is saying that they have conflicts within their value system.  The fact
that some emotions claim not to be emotions is the result of a lot of
terrible ideas from our past.

I say:
*BINGO*!

I see where our fundamental disagreement is. You say we have memories, 
thoughts and feelings; I say we ARE memories, thoughts and feelings. You say 
we are an object, a noun. I say we are an adjective, we are the way matter 
reacts when it is organized in certain ways. True, matter is needed for us to
exist, but that's not the important part because any matter will do, good 
thing too, the matter in your body is quite different than it was a year ago. 
The important thing is the way the matter is organized, the information.   
         
Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the soul  
and still remain within the scientific method.  
Consider the similarities:

1) The soul is non material and so is information.  

2) It's difficult to pin down a unique physical position for the soul, and 
   the same is true for information. Exactly where is the location of the 
   information that Caesar was a Roman or that 2 +2 =4 ?  

3) The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness, exactly the 
   same situation is true for information.  

4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.  
    

There are also important differences between the soul and information:  


1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  

2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is 
   understandable, in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is 
   understandable.

3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that,  
   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.
                                                            


                   >your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain. 
                     

To say that consciousness is in our brain is like saying speed is in a 
particular racing car and if we just look close enough we'll find it lurking 
someplace in the machinery, thus another car moving at the exact same 
velocity  must nevertheless have a different speed because the same speed 
can't be in two places at once. Obviously this doesn't work, I realize speed 
is just a scalar and mind has a huge number of variables, but if it doesn't 
work in the  simple case making it more complex won't help.

                >of consciousness that thinks it is you.                  
                  

So I don't really survive I just think I do? That's good enough for me 
because  if I think I've survived then I have. It's like those old Twilight 
Zones when at the end the hero is horrified to discover that he's really dead, 
even as a kid I never understood that, I'd be astounded and delighted to 
discover I was dead because that would mean death wasn't all it was cracked
up to be.

Yes, the upload would certainly believe that he was you, and I can find no  
reason to think he would be wrong.

Yes, very soon the two would start to diverge because of random factors and 
the fact that they would receive different input data from the environment, 
but that doesn't change the fact that at the instant the second original was 
made the two were identical. I should add that every day things happen to you 
that make your consciousness evolve in a completely different direction than 
it otherwise would, and this has nothing to do with copies.  
                   

                >Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.
                 

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Information can be copied and information 
can (probably) be destroyed by sending it through a non reversible computer 
or dropping a floppy disk into a Black Hole. If information no longer exists 
at point A but now exists at point B it sure sounds to me like it moved.

The easiest way to do an upload is the paint by numbers approach, replace  
each neuron with something much smaller and faster. To do this you'd need to 
have a good understanding about neurons operate but you wouldn't need to know 
how the brain as a whole operates. As you point out this is very limiting, 
a billion fold increase in speed and immortality is about all we could expect 
from it. To design something better we'd need to understand how intelligence 
operates, and that could be enormously difficult. It could take uploads  
100,000 years of vigorous research to figure it out, that's about an hour 
in our time.

I have a side to me that *really* believes in magic but another side of me

This is very, very bizarre.  I wish I could show this post to Leslie 
and watch the expression on her face.  The word "sexist" never entered 
her mind.  She would never use such language.  That was one thing 
we had in common.

I take my miracles when I can get them...  Leslie didn't have a great 
mind, but in her limited way she was a real artist, not a "political" artist.  
(I'm using the past tense because she died last year, more or less the 
same way Jimi Hendrix died.) 

I basically agree with your conclusion, and I intend to find a woman 
who shares my interests and passions.  The amazing thing is that my 
interests & passions, which used to be extremely esoteric, have 
suddenly become the trendiest thing on campus.  Another miracle.

I agree, preserving my phenotype is not good enough because a few things have

                >Oh dear oh dear.


In my opinion that part of Tipler's theory is self evidently true, the
uncertain part for me is if the laws of Physics are such that they allow the
universe to make an infinite, and not just an astronomically large, number of
calculations in a finite amount of time. If the Universe can do that then
everything else will follow naturally, or at least I think so, and to tell
the truth it's a lot more than 100 billion years, resurrection according to
Tipler will happen in 2 * 10^18 years, give or take a few hundred trillion.
I don't see why the length of time is important however, if I'm dead it would 
all seem instantaneous to me anyway.

Time will tell if Tipler is absurd or not, but I definitely don't think it's
sophistry because he can in principle be proven false. He makes a bunch of
predictions that we should be able to test for in the next 4 or 5 years.
Tipler himself states that every one of these predictions must turn out to be
correct or the entire theory is dead in the water.

* Tipler predicts that the universe is closed: I think most would say it's
  probably open, Tipler say's they're wrong. We'll see.

* Tipler wrote his book in early 1992 and predicted that the mass of the
  Top Quark would be 185 + - 20 GeV: At the time there was a report that it
  was at 135 GeV, Tipler said this must be in error and it turned out he was
  right. In March 1995 Fermi Lab found the Top Quark at 180 + - 13 GeV.

* Tipler predicts that the Higgs boson must be at 220 + - 20 GeV: If he's
  correct then when the CERN Large Hadron Collider goes on line in 1999 it
  will find it almost immediately.

* Tipler predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background
  black body radiation must be less than 6 * 10^-5: This prediction looks
  good, the observed value is around 5 * 10^-6.

* Tipler predicts that the Hubble constant must be less than or equal to 45:
  30 years ago most thought it was about 200, a year ago most thought it was
  85, today people are talking about 55.

* Tipler predicts that at maximum extent just before it starts to contract
  the universe must be 70^3 times larger than it is now or larger: This
  depends on the density of the universe so we'll have to clear up all the
  confusion over "Dark Matter" before we can tell how well he's doing on this
  one.

Tipler makes some other predictions that he doesn't know how to test for, but
there is no reason to think that it would be impossible for anyone to figure
out a way.

* Tipler predicts that the contraction of the universe will not be symmetrical.

* Tipler predicts that the entire universe is a past light cone: This means
  that if you send out a beam of light eventually it will circle the entire
  universe and come back and hit you in the back of the head, the time it
  takes to this depends on the size of the universe. Tipler says light will
  be able to make an infinite number of such trips before the universe
  collapses into a singularity.

* Tipler predicts that both density and energy will diverge to infinity
  during the big crunch, but the density must not diverge faster than the
  cube of the energy.

As I recall, this was the part in Permutation City which didn't work for
me. The people uploaded into progressively more computationally complex
worlds, and convienently forgot that somewhere there was a physical
machine
running all of this. If as an upload your "clock" is running ever more
slowly, you won't notice, so with limited physical hardware, a simulated
second of time might take a million physical years....

Well.... I AM a cryonicist, which implies an interruption in the stream
of consciousness. I can't prove I am not already in an uploaded state,
simulating my mundane physical existence. Perhaps "god" loaded me from
a backup this morning....

I'm sorry, this argument sounds like "soul" to me. If the SOC is based
in
information, it can be copied, uploaded, etc. If not, I see creeping
vitalism
here. IMHO, the SOC is actually information whose content is along the
lines
of "I exist" and consistency in the memories of same.

Almost all discussions of consciousness are metaphysics.

Not totally so, or how would you be aware of both? I program computers,
read science stuff, and work with clients as a shaman. When in shaman
mode,
the notions of soul, spirit, etc are very useful. When in cyber mode,
these
are word tags for various kinds of experience. I think in terms of
multiple
aspects rather than multiple personalities.

Possibly, but the meme is certainly not a new one. See Marcel Mauss's 'The
Gift' (written early this century) which deals with concepts of exchange
between individuals and cultures as a fundamental of all human activity,
whilst delineating 'commodity' (i.e. the subject of a trade) and 'gift'
(i.e. well, a gift, although reciprocity is a common feature of gift giving:
an interesting fact in itself).

Subsequent writers have interpreted Mauss's work in a variety of ways. I was
at a seminar by Maurice Bloch a couple of weeks ago where he was dicsussing
his new paper, which reconstructs Mauss's concepts of exchange. Instead of
seeing the fundamental feature as an exchange of physical items, Bloch sees
it as the exchange of the symbolic interpretations which occur during
discourse between individuals: a sort of semantic/semiotic and, quite
possibly, memetic approach to the interaction.

(As an aside: The whole thing seems to me to be moving towards a description
of social relations as performance, rather than static forms and functions.
This seems valid, especially when one integrates this line of thought with
current thoughts on sexuality and gender as performance.)

Hehe!  Nice one.

We get so serious on this list.  I think it's been a good few months
since I last fell off my chair in hysterics while reading our ditties;
it's good to see the occasional joke or double meaning to lighten the
proceedings.  It's anybody's guess what transhuman/posthuman comedy will
be like, but I would hazard to suggest that laughing at oneself and the
irony of events in the universe will always have appeal to at least that
section of transhumanity that continues to focus outwards and transform
the universe, since almost by definition that holds the comic/incongrous
/ironic vision of the tail wagging the dog.  That's good, in my worldview.

Rich.

Remember the "dust theory" - Permutation City was not run on any specific 
physical computer, but on the general substrate of reality. So if this 
substrate is finite (the Bekenstein Bound for the entire spacetime is 
finite), then Permutation City will eventually stop growing, while if it 
is infinite (like in an open universe) then it can (and will) run 
forever. 

There is a slight complication here; the laws of physics in the City would
imply with mathematical certainty that their cubical universe would expand
forever. If there isn't enough computing stuff in reality, then we have a
contradiction that cannot be resolved - unless we assume that strong
platonic materialism holds, and the substrate of computation isn't really
the physical universe but mathematical reality. This is just another way
of saying that if we ignore Egan's inconsistencies near the end, strong 
platonic materialism or an infinite universe holds.

I like this book for the way Egan takes an ontology and develops it 
beyond its limits.

Hi Chris,

Yes, there are Extropians in your area. The best ways to find them are: (a)
come to the monthly dinners just a few miles away here in Marina del Rey;
(b) Join the ExI-LA e-mail list to keep in touch with local dinners,
meetings, parties, and occasional outings; (c) Join Extropy Institute and
either put a notice in the Exponent newsletter that you want to meet people
in your area or I can help you get in touch.

I'm posting this to the list because Extropy Institute is looking to
encourage the formation of more local groups and gatherings, whether merely
dinner or lunch get-togethers or discussion groups. Currently these are
listed in the newsletter. John McPherson in San Diego has been gathering
information on Extropians who want to meet. (He himself is looking for
extropically-minded folks in the S.D. area.)

Onward!

My friend was hypnotizing me a few weeks ago, and we were trying to see if
he could make me ambidextrous. What he did was have me envision the
different parts of my brain, and have them talk to each and decide how
they could implement it. I don't remember the details, but it worked for
a while. I could put together a fairly coherent sentence while writing
with my left hand. 

While I wouldn't want any other personalities mucking around in my head,
I'm really interested in the concept of daimons allowing me to multitask.
Much like an artificial version of Zen martial arts, where the physical
processes are handled by some AI so I'm not conscious of them, so my
higher mind can work on things like tactics.  

They wouldn't have much decision making power outside their little sphere,
but they would certainly help with trivial things.

Would hypnosis help in developing independent "daimons" in my mind?

Thanks for checking Max, BUT FALL 97! For a manuscript that was
'completed' two years ago? It could get 'peer-reviewed' a million times
on the Internet by then!

By the way, Extropy #17 hasn't made it to the East coast yet...

There have been suggestions here for appropriating the traditional holidays 
and giving them an Extropian slant.  I suggest we celebrate Easter as the day 
when cryonics patients are reanimated.

Lyle, could you please explain what _you_ mean by real artist and political
artist?  I'm not sure I understand what you are referring to by "real" and
"political"; and also by what or whose standards.  Thanks.

Right.  You want to have the last word.  Typical female tactic.  
You're not going to get away with it.  

In reply to my statement, 

:: Leslie didn't have a great mind, but in her limited way 
:: she was a real artist, not a "political" artist.  

The Queene says:

T.S. Eliot said this about Henry James:  

> He had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it.  

I read this remark as a student and was mystified by it.  What on earth 
did Eliot mean?  Now I think I understand.  

Some artists start with an ism, and try to have the right thoughts 
as defined by their ism.  They have the right thoughts about sex, 
about race, about various other things.  And then they draw pictures, 
write stories, etc with the intention of making their audience also 
have the right thoughts.  This is political art.  

Other artists see isms as constraints to be escaped from.  A real artist 
has no sacred cows or isms or ideas.  A real artist cuts through all kinds 
of political cant and is willing to entertain thoughts that no one else 
would dare to think.  A real artist just produces art, and lets the political 
chips fall where they may.  

I'm not saying this distinction is always easy to make, nor that real 
artists are always better than political artists.  Some political artists 
produce very good work, and most "real" artists are not in the same 
league with Henry James.  But there is a distinction between the two 
kinds of art.

She was my slave off and on for a couple of years, in 1990-91.  
She died in 1995.  You're just jealous because you want me to

have not made that value judgement. But- nice inflammatory, amusing  and

BUT, you are right about something. I defined sexist as a male friend of mine
had once had after we had been at a party trying to make time:
Sexist: what a woman calls you when she doesnt want you to have sex with her.
The Other Definition :
Sexist : what a woman calls you when you don't want to have sex with her.

I am glad I am not male, how confusing it all must be ; )

 Just like a stream of consciousness ceases when I go to sleep
and a separate stream of consciousness is created when my body
wakes up? There will probably be something unique about the
discontinuity involved in uploading, but I have heard no reason
to expect that the mind which uploading produces lacks anything
that the mind which will inhabit my body after a more familiar
discontinuity has.

 Greater wealth through the ability to work at faster clock speeds.
More security through the ability to make distributed backups.

The "We are All Self-Employed" meme was brought up here, and 'banjo' wrote:

"The implied ideology behind a "WE ARE ALL SELF-EMPLOYED" meme, is that the 
natural metaphor for human relationships is commerce.

Im not that alienated from the human race."

I see in this response the idea that commerce and economics are something cold 
and impersonal and that to be engaged in these activities is equivalent to 
alienating oneself from others.  This is a common view of economics.  But it 
is a very superficial view.  All forms of economics and commerce are, at 
heart, agreements between people.  Generally, "commerce" and "economics" 
refers to agreements to trade things or services.  Economics and commerce are 
one form of agreements which people make with each other.  I don't see how 
agreeing with other people alienates one from those people.  Agreeing and 
having common goals generally pulls people together into closer and more 
intimate relationships, in my experience.

I make a different interpretation of the meme, "We are all self-employed".  To 
me, that phrase is equivalent to, "We are all responsible for our own lives".  
That is the implied ideology I see in the "Self-Employed" meme.  We all have 
certain resources available to us, including time, materials, talents, skills, 
knowledge, etc.  In running the business of our lives, we must choose how we 
will use our resources to achieve the desired effects in our lives.  If our 
desire is to spend a lot of time with particular people whom we love very 
much, then we must organize our lives in such a way that we can accomplish 
that goal.  And doing this is our own business, our own form of organization.

"Business" in the general sense is simply a way of organizing resources to 
accomplish certain objectives.  Business can be a cold, impersonal thing, or 
it can be a warm, loving, dynamic relationship between people.  It all depends 
on how it's organized.

Being self-employed doesn't mean that you can't work together with others.  
The most successful people are generally the ones who are good at working with 
others cooperatively, to the mutual benefit of everyone involved.  I don't see 
how this alienates people.

Taking responsibility for my own life by being self-employed encourages me to 
develop the resources necessary to achieve my goals, including the goals of 
developing deep and meaningful relationships with other people.  Being 
self-employed in no way causes me to be alienated from the human race.

I still find this kind of retort utterly baffling, even though it's
undeniable that one goes happily into sleep (or perhaps less happily into
medical unconsciousness) expecting that the `reconstituted' self that later
wakes is continuous with the present person.  And of course the only reason
for having one's head frozen at death is the conviction that a revived or
uploaded brain will be just as much `me' as `I' am after a snooze.  But
destructive emulation--

Why should I care about *his* `greater wealth'?  *Their* `security'?

Stipulate that evolutionary sieves have winnowed our genomes in favor of
phenotypes whose economic behavior is chanelled by the need to sustain (and
ideally increase) the components of that genotype.  On the standard
Fisher/Hamilton argument, then, we will tend to be `altruistic' toward other
bearers of  large chunk of the same genotype, because in some sense They R
Us.  Because evolution is mindless, this allows high-level adapted
structures such as brain and cultures to make `mistakes' of identification
and sacrifice individuals in support of the `wrong' genotypes.  Still,
evolution would be tickled pink if I sacrificed my current phenotype in
order to produce a dozen copies of my exact genome, with or without memetic
and individual memories.  *I*, however, might not be so ardent.

Suppose I could arrange for a dozen exact copies of myself by cloning - a
time-lapsed set of identical -tuples.  My genes would rejoice, but if I
could only achieve this by giving up my individual life I don't think I'd be
overjoyed.  Suppose, however, that these copies could also contain my exact
memories to this moment, so that I had spawned a dozen copies of myself
(which would, it's agreed, immediately split off from each other in terms of
experience, random wiring events, `identity' in short).  Would this make me
more inclined to die in order to achieve this goal?  Not me, bud.  Why
should I care about *their* greater wealth, etc?  

But suppose I were offered a `safe' neurological suspension attainable only
if I were killed in the process (it having be found that waiting for death
by senility caused the loss of too many brain cells, or something dire).
Would I go gently and immediately into that good night?  Gosh... a
*deathist* proposition?  These are difficult issues, the answers not at all
self-evident.

Greet! Celebrate reanimation! I've already decided to give science and 
information gifts for Newtonmas. Reanimation on Easter sounds perfect. 

In the US, Thanksgiving is coming up. Does anyone have an anecdote of an 
Extropian thanks?

The one holiday I'd suggest not being appropriated would be Independence 
Day (Cinco de Mayo, Bastille Day, Independence Day (for whoever). Because 
the extropian Independence Day still lies in the future. (IMHO)

My extropian thanks goes out to Timothy Leary, his writing from the 70's, 
LSD, Robert Anton Wilson, PK Dick, Crowley, SF Authors, Korzybski, B. 
Fuller, the history of scientific thought, iconoclasts, Andy Kaufman, Max 
More, the people on this list, etc, etc.

I would not debate the quality of the new conciousness, however, I would
beg to differ on the stream of conciousness of ME.  While the new
improved uploaded me who thinks it is still me has the same continuity
of conciousness as I, if I die, I'm dead, and he's somebody else and
thats it.  However, I beleive that an individual who takes an extended
period of time adding better, faster higher powered artificial
augmentation to the existing mind would, once a certain threshold had
been reached, have very little awareness of a difference of self if the
original bioware suddenly crashed. 

I also suspect that any clones would also feel a distinct pretectiveness
of self, something that is ingrained. (which brings up the question, is
a clone as smart as the original?)

Not to mention greater sensory bandwidth and a lack of need to lug a
heavy body around the world or solar system to take on a new project. I
would surmise that the closest we can ever actually get to teleportation
is to beam one's software template out to operate a cyborg at a distant
location. Given transciever stations on different planets, and the fact
that photons do not know what elapsed time is, we could have
instantaneous interplanetary and interstellar travel by beaming our
'wareness out to another planet, and loaded into an android or
gengineered organism capable of being implanted. Scotty, you're a has
been!

just this is ample justification to get to work now on really pushing
interstellar probes, to get recieving stations on site by the time we
are ready to use them to farcast.

Maybe we should think harder about whether our identity is preserved
across sleep.  This break in the stream of consciousness looks pretty
complete to me.  Many young children go through a phase where they are
afraid to fall asleep.  Perhaps some fear the loss of consciousness and
are not confident about still being alive when someone with their
memories awakens the next morning.

Imagine a race which didn't sleep, and which viewed any interruption in
the stream of consciousness with the same horror that the upload
skeptics here feel about destructive uploading.  How could you convince
them that your identity was in fact preserved across sleep, that the
entire human race isn't committing (involuntary) suicide every night,
with new people starting each morning under the mere illusion that they
had survived the night?

Try to imagine that you, yourself, do die every night, and awaken each
morning as a new person, with only memories to link you to the person you
were before?  Is this possible?  How will it be different when someone with
your memories awakens as an upload?

For a bunch that wants to live forever, I see alot of acceptance for a
process which MANDATES your death in order to reproduce immortal
offspring. What a paradox!

Well, you're certainly right about that! :-)

Actually, nothing that's hormone-driven makes much sense and is free of
confusion.  We have our work cut out trying to transcend it all though,
because the first step down that path is to have the will to do it, and
there isn't much of that about when it comes to things that are as fun
and as addictive as sex.

  I do not have equal respect to *any* piece of meat.
It is reasonable to base respect or any other attitude to an object based
on its function, not implementation details. 
"Implementationism" would be the most generic term for unfair discrimination.

Rationally speaking, there is no reason to believe that mindlessly evolved
meat-forms should be better than anything else imaginable. A proposition that
the only form of intelligence we know is the best possible one should come
with a good proof.
Current computers do not get much of my respect - but then, neither do many
humans.

If we want to start an *irrational* debate with unverifiable arguments (is
that a debate?) and call to "sacred values", then we can perform some rituals
with our computers and declare that they "should" be baptized, circumcised,
etc.  I do not think these rituals would be any more ridiculous than they
are for humans.

If something thinks it is me, has my memories, is thinking my thoughts and

If my consciousness is a "stream" it is a stream undergoing extreme 
turbulence, it bounces from one thing to another, doesn't seem to hurt me 
though, I'm the same man I was yesterday, I think.

It seems to me you could make exactly the same argument if you said  
information always moves and can never be brought to a halt, which leads me 
to think this is not a fruitful avenue to pursue. 
                   

                >The physical translation of information from one point in

I think it's very meaningful. After Turing machine A produces an output 
there will be a delay before Turing machine B can use it, this delay is 
proportional to the distance between A and B.

I very much doubt such a murky idea can even be expressed mathematically,  
much less be proved or disproved.

Every time the telephone rings my stream of consciousness is interrupted, 
when you read this post your consciousness is different than it would be if 
you were reading another post. I don't see why that is such a big deal that 
it makes us different people.

Unless the religious people are right, consciousness must be based on  
information processing, that's why I don't understand your theory. You're  
saying, I think, that information exists outside our physical universe, 
if so  then the information in my head and the information in my upload a 
thousand  miles away must be the same, after all you also say " a physical
translation  in space of the substrate is irrelevant".  Also, I don't see why 
you keep distinguishing between "originals" and "copies", if your theory is 
right then everything in the physical universe is a "copy".   
                 

                >There can be many instances of a single brain, each with its                 
                >own consciousness.
                 

Yes, I believe it would be possible in theory for a brain to generate more  
than one consciousness, and I think it's possible for one consciousness to 
run  on several brains.                
          

                >Information is only encoded on objects that exist in the                 
                >physical universe.  


I don't understand why you say "only encoded" like it's not important, 
because you also say "For information to exist, it must be encoded on a 
substrate".      


                >If every piece of substrate containing a specific piece of

Not necessarily. It would be difficult to destroy the information that  
2 + 2 = 4 because nobody knows where or how it's encoded. Even Shakespeare's 
plays could be rediscovered by a monkey banging on a typewriter,  it would 
take a long time, but not an infinitely long time. 

To my mind this does indeed give some support to the idea that information  
can exist external to the physical universe, but certainly not to the idea  
that there is a fundamental difference between a copy and an original or that  
exactly the same information can't be encoded in 2 very different ways.

I think that intelligent behavior and consciousness must be inextricably 
linked, otherwise I don't see why we would be aware at all. However important 
subjective feelings may be to us, Evolution is only interested in behavior 
because only behavior enhances survival. Evolution would never have given us
consciousness unless it was needed for intelligence, that's one reason I 
think the Turing Test works.

Suppose an exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, 
were made a billion light years away. The duplicate world 
would need some sort of feedback mechanism to keep the worlds 
in synchronization, non linear effects would amplify tiny variations, 
even quantum fluctuations, into big differences, but this is just a 
thought experiment so who cares. In the first two cases below the results 
would vary according to personalities, remember there's a lot of illogic 
even in the best of us.

1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum
   to my head and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains
   out, am I concerned ? You bet I am because I know that your
   double is holding an identical gun to the head of my double and
   making an identical threat.

2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds 
   will diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but 
   my double will be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, 
   in times of intense stress nobody is very logical. My double is 
   no longer exact because I am going through a traumatic experience 
   and my double is not. I'd be looking at that huge gun and wondering 
   what it will be like when it goes off, and if death will really be 
   instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy was really as sound 
   as I thought it was, and I'd also be wondering why I get the bullet and 
   not my double, and cursing the unfairness of it all. My (semi) double 
   would be thinking "it's a shame about that other fellow but I'm glad 
   it's not me".

3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads 
   and we are both convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, 
   making a hell of a mess, but the other gun for inexplicable reasons 
   misfires. In this case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying 
   experience I am completely unharmed.

I beleive that there is a significant difference between copying a
conciousness, which operates independently of a root conciousness, and a
gradual process of gradually copying one's various files one at a time,
verifying operability, and then transfering processing tothe new file
from the old, and deleting the old.  This would maintain the individual
stream of conciousness, while the first, in the instance of destructive
copying, would not, relative to the original wetware. When we talk about
stream of conciousness, we need to maintain that this is relative to the
original copy.  It does not matter if the original copy shuts down for
defragging once a day, it is still itself because it only copied and
erased minute fractions of its conciousness at any one time, and we know
that a human can operate with a significant loss of brain capacity, just
not with a total loss, although facetiously, I can think of some
congressmen who seem to be doing just fine.

THis is merely obfuscation.  What he is saying is that a total loss of
one's wetware at once equates to total loss of ones stream of
conciouness.  Small losses can be accomodated for, and if copies of
individual sectors can be used to augment ones bioware, then one could
eventually slowly transfer one's conciousness, bit by bit to a new
substrate.

Here's a metaphor: You are an octopus in a bottle that has a small neck.
THe bottle is opened and connected to another small necked bottle that
has food in it (gotta have an attractor). The octopus could:

A) Bud off a clone of itself and send it to the new bottle, whilst the
clone is still baby sized. THe downside is that the original octopus is
still in the old bottle and is getting hungrier, while the new octopus
doesn't seem to give a whit.

B) Slowly move, one leg of itself at a time, into the new bottle (I've
seen this happen) until finally it squeezes its head through the neck,
and is in the new bottle, munching away happily

Right and no intelligent being would freely give up his or her own
conciousness for another, unless the stakes were pretty grim and in your
face.

We want to be immortal and uploaded as ourselves, not as somebody else
who thinks "they is us."

WOuld a circumcised computer be a Pentium 75 with 4 MRAM?

Actually, while Fantasy fans may anthromorphize their computers, real SF
fans are a rather rational bunch (Trekkers exlcuded). ALthough any guy
who reads SF and works on a computer is likey to not have a girlfreind,
so anthromorphing one's computer may serve the same function as a teddy
bear, though maybe not a blow up doll.

[no one uses TAGS: anymore]

I just read Zindell's _The Wild_.  I haven't read anything else by
Zindell, because no bookstore in the area has had anything by him, so my
only previous exposure had been Anders' quotations from _The Broken
God_.

Thumbnail review: it was interesting.  Certainly a transhuman book, with
issues of identity duplication, computer intelligence, really big
entities which can fake being gods, and so on.  It refired my
imagination in some respects.  In others... the long stretches of
mystical prose-poetry didn't grab me, not to mention the other mystical
elements -- scrying, remembrancing, consciousness directly manipulating
matter.  If one makes a scale with _A Fire Upon the Deep_ at one end,
and _Dune_ at the other, the universe of this book seemed closer to
_Dune_, which annoys me.  Why?

These days I seem to prefer hard SF or outright fantasy.  Both _Fire_
and _The Wild_ are books which find wonder and magic in extrapolating
known technology, but which are flawed from the 'hard' viewpoint.  But
the flaws serve different purposes.  Zindell's mystical garnishes seem
intended to enhance the magical flavor of the book, but they end up
distracting and cheapening what derives from the harder nanotech/AI
developments.  Vinge's flaw is the Zones.  The key difference (to me) is
that the Zones aren't meant to enhance anything.  They're meant as an
explicit gimmick to allow the existence of normal humans to perceive the
glory of the Powers.  Vinge wrote hard SF with a crutch (neatly folding
the FTL crutch into the same package); Zindell wrote almost hard-SF with
fringe decorations.  But the appeal of hard extrapolations is in
avoiding such fringes...

Last night I went to a multi-media, live performance exhibition at EZTV in
Hollywood.  It was a costume party featuring Burning Man [Wired magazine
features article by Bruce Sterling] photographs and video clips, live
musicians, dancers, and video artists including Fiorella Terenzi and myself.

Burning Man photos were stunning. The sculpture itself looked dazzling and
radiant. Just the enormity of the sculpture is intense. It was difficult to
see the video clips clearly due to the live band in front of the screen. I
don't know if anyone on this list went to the event (ritual, rave ?), but if
you did, I'd like to hear about it.

David Zindell's first book is _Neverness_. People here might like

        Whoops!  Guess I'm not a *real* artist then.  Better put *this* poet
out to the pasture before he starts polluting the list!  :-)

        In other words, I couldn't disagree more!  Myself --and I'm sure a
lot of other *real* artists-- can incorporate the political meanings into
their art.  I don't think there should be an actual 'guideline' for what an
artist must do to be real.  Reality comes in many forms...so does art!

        The way I see it is that there is no 'break' in the stream of
consciousness from being awake to sleeping.  Instead, there is a transfer
from 'awake consciousness' to 'asleep consciousness'...what we call
'subconsciousness'.  When we are asleep, our minds make our bodies into
mechanical systems.  The mind needs not worry about an unforseen burst of
adrenaline etc., it is all under control.  Dreaming proves that there is a
consciousness while we are sleeping, it is just on a different level.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Many Extropians and Transhumanists dream of transferring their consciousness 
onto a different substrate than the biological one they currently are running 
on.  Many want to have their brain simulated, atom-for-atom, by incredibly 
powerful computers and provide themselves with whatever sensory reality they 
desire.  They believe that being run on a computer will give them much more 
freedom to alter themselves and improve themselves, and they look forward to 
being able to have their realities be whatever they desire them to be.  This 
idea, called "Uploading" is as appealing to many Transhumanists and Extropians 
as the idea of Heaven is to Christians and other religious people.

I have been thinking about uploading lately and what fundamental differences 
there would be to living in a computer versus living in the world of molecules 
and cells.  Since many people who want to be uploaded want their lives to be 
similar to the way they are now, there would not be much difference at all for 
them.  But would they die?  That is an important question to consider, since 
many people view uploading as a way to avoid dying.  Is the upload environment 
really a safe one?  The biological world is not, since there are many ways a 
person can become disintegrated and disorganized (also known as dying).  Can 
an upload be disintegrated?  Are there any guaranteed ways to avoid computer 
viruses in the upload environment that basically cause a person's 
consciousness to disintegrate?  I don't think so.  In my opinion, the upload 
environment will be as dangerous as the biological world and will be far from 
the paradise that many dreamers imagine it will be.  I see no reason why the 
upload environment will be free from predators.

I actually consider this world that I find myself in to be an upload 
environment.  Since it is truly impossible to determine whether this world is 
being run on a computer or not, I see no reason to assume that it is not, 
especially since we are proposing that worlds as richly detailed as our own 
will be run on computers someday.  

I like to think that we are living in a world of software; that atoms and 
molecules and cells and so forth are software modules, with various 
properties, interacting with other software modules.  My body / consciousness 
is one kind of software in this computer environment.  Unfortunately, this 
software has several properties which I would like to alter.  For one thing, 
it is fairly easy to disturb the software module that I am and cause me to 
disintegrate; I am a fragile being.  Also, these bodies tend to self-terminate 
after a while.  I don't see my situation as all that different from an upload, 
facing the dangers and limitations they will face.  As far as I can tell, I AM 
an upload already.  The world of physics is the computer that I am being run 
on.

So, for me, the question is:  What can I do with the resources I have in 
WHATEVER environment I find myself in?  Currently, I find myself to be a 
biological being in a very complex sensory environment.  I have certain 
thinking and acting faculties, which I am learning how to use, by playing 
around with them and seeing what they can do.  I can change the shape of my 
body by contracting various muscles, and I can use this feature to alter my 
sensory environment in various ways, sometimes called "moving things around".  
I can also use certain muscles and a fractal-like bag of air, to cause certain 
flaps of tissue to vibrate in various ways, which alter the part of my sensory 
environment called "hearing".  By vibrating my throat in different patterns, I 
seem to have some amount of control over certain other parts of my sensory 
environment called "other people".  I have other faculties also that I am 
discovering how to use to alter my sensory environment in various, desirable 
ways.

That is how I operate.  I asess my current situation to discover what 
resources I have, and I play around with those resources to gain an 
understanding of what I can do with them, and then I use my available 
resources to make my current situation more the way I want it to be.  I am 
learning to make the most out of what I have.

I find myself to have a biological brain, but I don't moan about it's 
limitations, like many Extropians and Transhumanists do.  Yes, there is much 
that my brain CAN'T do, but I'm busy finding out what it CAN do and making the 
most of that.  I don't think any of us here are using our brains to anywhere 
even close to their full capacity.

This is the challenge I have given to myself: to operate at my highest 
capacity; to make the most of what I have; to find out what I'm truly capable 
of.  It may be that I have some fundamental limitations, but I'm wanting to 
advance myself right up to those limitations, to push myself to my limits, and 
then hopefully find a way to surpass those limits.

I am very optimistic about what my brain is capable of.  I think it's possible 
for me, and for nearly all humans, to surpass the brilliant genius of Mozart, 
of Einstein, of daVinci, of all past and current geniuses.  The geniuses show 
us some of what the biological brain is capable of, but I like to believe that 
even they weren't anywhere close to using their full capabilities.

I ask myself:  What am I cabable of?  

My life will be my answer.

Damn I hate this thread due to the fact that this is scary shit! Especially
the part about children afraid of falling asleep because they're stream of
consciousness would end. I'm going to have a tough time going to sleep
tonite.  If sleep=death then death wasn't all it was cracked up to be so
perhaps there's no need to fear it.

 Why are you trying to argue that regulators would rather avoid such
bans? My impression is that most people find it hard to hold beliefs
that their work is harming people, and that it is much easier to
assume that regulatory agencies attract mainly those workers who
are inclined to believe that such bans are good.

Hell, build your own body or 'avatar' as it is called. You could be
anything you want as well as build your house, world, solar system all
without physical materials. You'd probably have to pay for living space in
the form of terabytes.

Or you could use a slower form of nano where you shoot our nanites carrying
your cells which reconstruct you at the destination. They could pack you
into a dense reentry shell and when just about to impact, reorganize you
into yourself. I always did wonder in Star Trek how they reconstructed the
away team on the planet's surface! Hell maybe we're seeing millions of
clones of Deanna Troy.

 I'm not a bunch that wants to live forever. I'm a mind that wants
its memories and behavior patterns to be followed by a series of mental
states for which:
 - no mental state lacks any memories or behavior patterns that its
  immediate predecessor had, unless the immediate predecessor mental
  state wanted to get rid of those memories or behavior patters, and
 - there are frequent improvements in the memories and behavior patterns
  of the mental states.
 Why should I care whether the means I use to accomplish these goals
fall within the definition of death?

 I don't think I want to live forever, because that implies a stagnation
of identity that is inconsistent with my current value system. As long
as I am replacing my identity with improved versions of my current self,
I expect that the identity "Peter McCluskey as he exists in 1996" will
exist to gradually lesser extents in future years, and that even if the
fractions of my 1996 identity which exist in each succeeding year is an
infinite series, the sum of those fractions will probably be a finite
number.

 I can't explain why you "should" care about future beings that are
nearly identical to your current self. I am merely pointing out that
you haven't convinced me that you have a nonarbitrary reason for caring
more the being who awakes tomorrow in the Damien Broderick body than
you care about the uploaded being with memories and behavior patterns
indistinguishable from those of the Damien Broderick of today.

Or perhaps it's a method to lull the consciousness to death?

Two book recommendations:

_Quantum Technology_, by Gerard Milburn (Allen & Unwin - an Australian
publisher, on the web at http://www.allen-unwin.com.au; I don't know
who's in charge of distribution outside of Oz).

A pop-science book on atom optics, quantum electronics, quantum
encryption and quantum computation, by an atom-optics researcher. 
Lots of interesting concepts, like "optical crystal" (an array of atoms 
held at the nodal points of an electromagnetic standing wave).  One
reason I like this book is just that, for several such topics, it's the 
only book about them that I've seen in print so far. (Another good
feature: bibliography, and names and locations of researchers.)

_Holy Fire_, by Bruce Sterling.  (My copy comes from Millennium Books
in the UK.) His new novel. Life extension, gerontocracy, posthumanist
artists. Greg Egan's _Diaspora_ will probably be good too, but it's not
in print yet.

Hi people

This might be old news.  Just in case it's not, here's a quote from Dr Hugo
de Garis, and a lead to his sites:

`I head the Brain Builder Group at ATR, a research lab in Kyoto, Japan. I
expect, with the help of
my group, to build an artificial brain with a billion artificial neurons,
with evolved cellular automata
(CA) based neural circuits, by the year 2001. We already have 10 million
neurons, and expect to
achieve our target on time. By evolving neural net modules with roughly 100
neurons each, at
ELECTRONIC SPEEDS in special evolvable hardware, we will be able to assemble
these
modules (each with its own evolved user specified function) into brain
architectures. Examples of
future applications are :- robot kittens with 1000 behaviors, household
cleaner robots, etc. 20 years
from now, brain-like computers should generate a trillion dollar industry.'

He's at

Thank you Shaun.  Especially when we interact in virtual environs.

To even assume that there is a strict set of codes which enable or castrate
an artist is out to pasture. I have been wondering this afternoon why an
artist  even responds to threads that clearly have little to do with
Extropic Art.  

Further, we do not need to defend or argue points which are headed
backwards.  Our role is to ignite the imagination - to bring vision.  If our
time is spent explaining what is and is not art, then we might as well sit
up all night in smoke filled cafe's of the early 20th Century.  We are at
the sunset of the 20th Century.  We have an opportunity to set a pace with
the 21st Century - now.

Rather than spend time debating about what is or isn't art, why not debate
whether to use VR in our next performances, which designs to use to create
robotic sculptures, whether or not neon or fiber optics is the way to go
when implementing an electronic memetic billboard.  We can exchange ideas
with other technicians about designing interactive electronnic
communications projects, or scientists about next years collaborative Ars
Electornica in France, or ARTEC in Japan.

Hi

The concept of "real" art is too silly to respond to. 
Natasha is right, you can't spend your time on this and be Extropic at the
same time. Meanwhile some of us do
things.

I have a question for Anders or Sarah or anyone else who seems to actually
LIKE and know about art. I noticed
lately that Anders , you have mentioned Egyptian Mythology...Sarah too...On
this rather vast Art History 
and Architecture website I am constructing, we have a sub-page ( with pics of
the Gods and so forth) on Egypt 
and the Myths, the scholar who I am working with wants "comments by others"..
anything you may want to contribute would be welcome! This goes to highschool
distance edu.
Love, respect and admiration,
Urrealist, Unreal artist

        By Ian Williams Goddard

        In reaction to medical cannabis access referendums on 
        the ballots in Arizona and California, former presidents 
        Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George Bush signed a let-
        ter stating that they ``categorically oppose'' access to 
        cannabis for its many proven therapeutic uses such as the
        prevention of blindness and epileptic seizures [1].

        Their chief concern was that legal medical access would 
        send the message that cannabis is safe.  The presidents 
        can, however, lay their safety concerns to rest because 
        the scientific literature overwhelmingly confirms that 
        cannabis is both an effective and safe medicine.


        The Cannabis Safety Profile 

        The journal PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS [2] reports that
        decades of research prove that, "Compared with legal
        drugs...marijuana does not pose greater risks."  Yet
        based upon mortality statistics,  we can safely con-
        clude that cannabis is one of the safest medical drugs
        known, for, while prescription drugs, defined as safe
        by the FDA, kill up to 27,000 and aspirin up to 1,000 
        Americans per year, cannabis kills 0 per year [3].

        When we know the facts we can understand why in 1988, 
        after extensive review of the scientific literature, 
        the DEA's own administrative judge Frances Young con-
        cluded that ``Marijuana is one of the safest thera-
        peutically active substances know to man.'' [4]

        Opponents of legal cannabis access would have us be-
        lieve that there is not enough research available to
        determine its safety.  Nothing could be further from 
        the truth. Cannabis is one of the most thoroughly re-
        searched drugs in history, and the evidence gathered 
        over the centuries clearly proves that it is safe:

        * The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report (1894): an
        exhaustive seven-volume, 3,281-page report that con-
        cludes: "Moderate [cannabis] use produces practically 
        no ill effects." [5][6][7]

        * The Panama Canal Military Study (1916-1929), amass-
        ing extensive data on the health impact of cannabis
        smoking upon  American soldiers stationed in Panama,
        recommended that "No steps be taken by the Canal Zone 
        authorities to prevent the sale or use of Marihuana." 
        The research also concluded that, "There is no evi-
        dence that Marihuana...is...'habit-forming.'" [7][8]

        * The LaGuardia Report (1939-1944), commissioned by
        New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, which includ-
        ed evidence gathered over thousands of years,  con-
        cluded that "Smoking marihuana does not lead to add-
        iction... does not lead to morphine, heroin, or co-
        caine addiction"  and that  "the publicity concern-
        ing the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking
        in New York City is unfounded." [7][9]

        * The Baroness Wootton Report (1968), commissioned 
        by the Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence of the 
        United Kingdom Home Office, concluded, "There is no 
        evidence that...serious physical dangers are directly 
        associated with the smoking of cannabis." The report 
        also noted that "Cannabis use does not lead to heroin 
        addiction" and that  "there is no evidence that [can-
        nabis]...is producing in otherwise normal people con-
        ditions of dependence or psychosis, requiring medical
        treatment." [7][10] 

        The HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH LETTER [11]
        reports the findings of other major cannabis studies:

             In three major studies conducted in Jamaica, 
             Costa Rica, and Greece, researchers have
             compared heavy long-term cannabis users 
             with non-users and found no evidence of 
             intellectual or neurological damage, no 
             changes in personality,  and no loss of 
             the will to work or participate in society. 

        The Jamaican study states that,  even as cannabis use
        in Jamaica "is pervasive" and is used "in heavier quan-
        tities with greater THC potency than in the U.S.," its 
        use is "without deleterious social or psychological 
        consequences." [12]

        What's more, the three studies cited, the largest human
        cannabis studies to date, also revealed that heavy long-
        term cannabis users scored slightly higher on IQ tests, 
        had slightly lower rates of illness and cancer, and liv-
        ed longer on average than non-users. Users also proved 
        to be more relaxed and sociable than non-users [4][12]
        [13]. The best evidence indicates, contrary to GovtMedia 
        disinformation, that cannabis is safe and good for you.

        In line with the findings of the Panama Canal study
        and the LaGuardia Report,  current research confirms
        that the addictive potential of cannabis is very low.
        The journal TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES states 
        that research shows cannabis has  "limited potential 
        for development of...psychological dependence due to 
        the weak reinforcing properties of Delta-9-THC." [14] 
        BRAIN RESEARCH journal observes that "cannabinoid 
        dependence and withdrawal phenomena are minimal." [15] 

        Research proves that cannabis is nontoxic. For example,
        in the journal FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED TOXICOLOGY [16], 
        Dr. William Slikker, director of the Neurotoxicology  
        Division of the National Center for Toxicological Re-
        search (NCTR), described the health of monkeys exposed 
        to very high levels of cannabis for an extended period:

             The general health of the monkeys was not 
             compromised by a year of marijuana exposure  
             as indicated by weight gain, carboxyhemoglobin 
             and clinical chemistry/hematology values.

        When THE ARKANSAS TIMES [17] asked Dr. Merle Paule of 
        NCTR about evidence of cannabis toxicity and the health 
        of the monkeys in the study, Dr. Paule said, "There's 
        just nothing there. They were all fine."

        The journal TOXICOLOGY LETTERS [18] published a study 
        that found no link between cannabis smoking and lung 
        cancer. The seven researchers in the study concluded:

             It has been suggested that marijuana smoking 
             is a proximal cause of respiratory cancer. 
             However, these intimations have not been 
             borne out by epidemiological investigation.

        Not only is the evidence linking cannabis smoking to 
        cancer negative, but the largest human studies cited in-
        dicated that cannabis users had lower rates of cancer
        than nonusers. What's more, those who smoked both can-
        nabis and tobacco had lower rates of lung cancer than 
        those who smoked only tobacco -- a strong indication
        of chemo-prevention [4][12][13]. Even more, in 1975 re-
        searchers at the Medical College of Virginia found that 
        cannabis showed powerful antitumor activity against 
        both benign and malignant tumors (the government then 
        banned all future cannabis/cancer research) [4].  In
        fact,  the NEW ENGLISH DISPENSATORY of 1764 recommends
        boiled cannabis roots for the elimination of tumors [19].
        Powerful evidence that cannabis not only does not cause
        cancer, but that it may prevent and even cure cancer.

        The few studies that the GovtMedia drums into the pub-
        lic mind over and over,  which claim to show that can-
        nabis is a harmful drug, are almost all the work of the
        the government's top hired gun, Dr. Gabriel Nahas. The
        NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE described Nahas's work
        as "psychopharmacological McCarthyism that compels him 
        to use half-truths, innuendo and unverified assertions." 
        The JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION also con-
        demned his work, stating, "Examples of biased selection
        and...omissions of facts abound in every chapter." [20]

        Conclusion:

        Not only does the best scientific research overwhelming-
        ly confirm that cannabis is both an effective medicine 
        and a safe drug, but that it may be both chemo-preven-
        tive and therapeutic and generally beneficial to health. 
        What this shows us most clearly, in light of the consen-
        sus to the contrary, is the enormous power of a Big Lie. 

        With its vast resources, the "GovtMedia elite" are 
        able to fabricate and fob off a pharmacological fraud 
        against both cannabis and the public interest. Through 
        sheer repetition and consistent suppression of contrary 
        information, they are able to construct an edifice of 
        public consensus which even the hardest scientific 
        facts fail to topple.

        The truth is no stronger than the ability of true in-
        formation to surpass the public distribution of false 
        and misleading information. The GovtMedia has a greater 
        ability to distribute a Big Lie than any other sector 
        of society has to distribute the truth. However, this 
        report right here contains copious quantities of care-
        fully referenced scientific facts that consistently 
        and conclusively confirm that cannabis is safe --
        thereby exploding the GovtMedia's Big Lie. 

        As truth is only as powerful as it is known, do all 
        that is in your power to make these powerful facts 
        known, that we might put an end to the destructive 
        and illogical prohibition of the proven safe and ef-
        fective drug cannabis,  for possession of which 10 
        million Americans have been arrested since 1965 [21].

i disagree
where is the proof ?
how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,
homelessness, a stuffed-to-overflowing penal system, and as
Dale Carnegie said a place where "...rich and poor are both free
to sleep under bridges".

i don't understand.  are you saying that someone who "suffers material
privation" (aka Poverty), deserves it.  Is the market equivalent of
an outcaste or hermit ??

damn right, and it's not just "plain ol' loving", what about
filial duties and conflicts, jealousy, hate, platonic friendships etc

i feel uncomfortable with theories that try to wrap up something as
complex and self-referential as human relationships into a single 
ideology/word/concept/meme/theory.  I'm reminded of the Japanese 
saying "when all you have is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail".

i value an extensive mental toolkit, and access to the artists who
can break molds and allow us fresh glimpses into what it means to
be human.

i do not share this view, i just believe it of Economists  ;)
Although Marxists say that engaging in these activities *is* alienating,
especially for wage earners.

OK, several things...
1) you seem to totally integrated the "Human Relations as Commerce" meme.
   By your definition Romantic Love is Business.
2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on trade ?
3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful people..."

4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"
   are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,
   children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???

i'm not denying that "commerce is natural", i'm only denying that
"commerce is all"

yup, although i don't think of the population of Uraguay in terms of

	Why ignore the revolving door between the regulated and the
regulators?

	Why ignore that regulations are used to covertly cartelize an
industry?  and further used to covertly pick winners and losers
independent of the market!  Why be naive?

	Some think the rather arbitrary actions of the FDA regarding
artificial sweetners was a case in point.

My suggestion is that you start out with _Neverness_, the "zeroth" book of
his current trilogy (_The Broken God_, _The Wild_, <upcoming>), it is IMHO
the best of the books and explains the world much better than the rest.

Actually, I think Zindell has a more serious purpose in his magical style.
He isn't trying to write about the real functioning of his universe (as
hard sf tries to do), what interests him are deeper philosophical
questions and the development of a transhumanist myth. The real plot of
_The Wild_ is about Danlo's growth into a "true human" (whatever that is; 
I find him sometimes nauseatingly saintly), while _Neverness_ dealt with a
human's growth into a god. These themes are perhaps possible to deal with
in hard sf, but Zindell choose a looser style since it suited him (and it
may make the myth stronger).

	Yeah sure!  I would say that whatever happens, it is a conspiracy.
Please, let's not waste time with stupid questions.

	Monopolies tend to raise prices and contract production to
increase profits.  Obviously, this can go too far and result in decreased
profits if volume contracts too much.  There is obviously a profit
optimizing point.

	Your last sentence does not follow as it is another very
competitive situation pharmaceutical companies would like to avoid.

	What you are missing is the problem of uncertainty in a free
market competitive situation.  When availabilty of capital is the only
barrier to market entry by newcomers, the existing producers are
vulnerable to business failure, not just low profits.  A poorly conceived
new entry might drive the whole industry toward bankruptcy or a new entry
with fantastic new production methods might drive out existing producers.
Also, vicious price wars might develop among existing producers leading to
bankruptcies.

	Established producers see regulatory systems, covertly controlled
more or less by themselves, as insurance against these risks.  The
established producers can generally see to it that newcomers are given an
especially "hard way to go" by the regulators when they attempt to enter
the market.  There is no reason to think regulations will be enforced
objectively, none whatsoever.  Regulators are easily subverted into
picking winners and losers instead of confining themselves to objective
regulation!  See saccharine vs aspertame for example.

	Anyone think it odd that Value Jet was shut down when it had a
crash while established firms suffer little or no scrutiny when they have
a crash?  Just one little example.

	Yeah, but they would do even better if they could set up a cartel

people differentiating their products could be defined as frauds!

	You brought-up CIA mind control to discredit me and now you admit
you know nothing about the basic evidence for it revealed by Congressional
Committees decades ago!  Much of what Extropians want to do is being
studied intensively by the CIA and Pentagon black budgets.

	Apparently, you don't really want to know that "political
correctness" is engineered by those who benefit.  Look at what the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund finances....everything Extropians and
Libertarians oppose!  Just a coincidence?  The existing ruling class is
primarily devoted to memetic engineering!  Developing belief systems
beneficial to themselves!  Study what the great Foundations are up to...
What is the mass media up to...

	The rules they are already working on will drastically restrict
vitamins....why do you suppose the great corporations are promoting GATT
and NAFTA and WTO?  So vitamins can be sold over the counter...?  So
consumers will benefit?

	Well, we certainly agree on this point.  I suspect you need to
read a bit more business history.  Business and industry seeks to build
cartels at every opportunity, as Adam Smith noted.  I have no objection to
voluntary ones as they are fleeting in the face of the market, but via
control of government big business systematically forms informal, covert
cartels.

	Fortunately, their control over government, though more effective
than that of anyone else, is imperfect.

To repeat it for the umpteenth time: there is nothing intrinsically holy 
or beautiful in the act of sex. It's in the eye of the observer, entirely. 
Sex is an artefact of evolution, tailored to fulfill its range of tasks 
(mostly, autoreplication) it was designed to do. Period. 

Once the entire background situation changes qualitatively, sex is obsolete.

Trying to perpetuate sex, particularly to drag along sex in an upload 
mind ecology all the way up to Omega, is, sorry to say it, simply 
ludicrous.

(Caveat: An upload universe, unless unlimited-resource, will have 
darwinian evolution, will have death, and ergo, probably autoreplication. 
If the entire persona bandwidth is present, from the virus to god 
equivalent, some species will probably have some coitus procedure (unless 
there are no distinct personae, nor timespace as we know it, that is)).

Yes, but I never said memory and consciousness were identical, I did say they

Suppose I show you 2 people, you talk and get to know them, then I then take 
them away and upload them. One I Upload very gradually under conditions you 
would consider ideal, the other one I upload instantaneously with my gamma ray 
pulse laser. Now I show you the 2 uploads and let you ask them any question 
and perform any test you like. Is there any way you could determine which one 
was uploaded quickly and which one was not? If the Scientific Method can not 
find any difference we must conclude that there is no difference, or we will 
sink into the swamp of metaphysics and superstition.

 What he said is someone who CHOOSES material privations is not
suffering harm, as it is a freely chosen activity.  Someone who chooses
to remain an alcoholic, risks giving up his or her property, families,
and means of earning wealth, so to be homeless individual in order to
remain  substance abuser, in spite of the efforts of any other person
who cares about them, means voluntarily accepting ones suffering. THe
state of the economy has not a damn thing to do with it. I know, I was
there once.

SOmeone who freely choses not to make the effort to obtain the education
to earn a good living voluntarily accepts the associated suffering of
living in poverty. I know, I was there once.

THe HIGH poverty is a function of the amount of government subsidy for
reproduction among those who freely choose to remain in poverty.

The stuffed to everflowing penal system is a function of government
attempting to limit the individuals right to freely chose to use
substances which may harm them. Put them in jail instead, where they can
get drugs even easier, and catch AIDS as well.

Your Dale Carngie had it right. We are all free to chose wealth or
poverty, to choose to be with the families that love us or live alone
under bridges.

In an evolutionary sense, probably. But already sex is used mostly for
pleasure and self-expression, not procreation. Making a universal statement
like "sex is obsolete" requires you to make more of an argument. Why should
everyone stop having sex (in whatever future form) just because *you* don't
see it as worthwhile in your future life? Would you do away with all other
pleasurable and expressive activities if they are not tied to survival or
material gain (if these are the values you see as central for uploads)?

Rather than saying "sex is obsolete" in the changed conditions of the
future, I think it more reasonable to say that sex will be optional. We will
be able to choose whether, when, how much, and with regard to who/what we
feel sexual urges. Becoming posthuman to me means not abolishing everything
about being human (though somethings may be good to abolish) but making them
a matter of choice, and being able to refine them.

I never said sex was holy - you said that.  
I look forward to enhancing intimacy and cherish 
it for its own sake.  Here and now.

>>Sex is an artefact of evolution, tailored to fulfill its range of tasks

Ok,  you have determined sex is purely for procreation.
I see no supporting argument, but even with one:
 So what? Do you have a problem with other people
enjoying sex? Valuing it?  You dont value it, OK, 
don't have it, but is your criteria for advancement the "correct", hence only
available one for me? For all?

Your response is understood, and I must point out it
has nothing to  do with my post. Dragging something 
into other people's uploads has never been my thing.
The original response was addressing the type of 
addictive sex Rich mentioned, and his use of
the word transcend. I suggested intergrating it to 
a more balanced process. 
I wasnt talking about posthumans, BTW, but while 
we are on the subject,  if one could manage to keep
some kind of intimacy linked to a chemical response, 
it might enhance an upload's pleasure and real time communication. We may
chose to include sensory " anachronisms" in ourselves to  keep some "human" 
in posthumanity ( those who desire it).. see it as an option.
You can skip that software.
: )  Anyway, I assume pleasure will be different for each individual.

John, that is relative to me. To me It deos not really matter, as you
all are figments of my imagination anyway. TO the two people you
uploaded by different means, it makes a world of difference. The guy you
flash uploaded is dead, and his simulacrum thinks he is the original.

The typical Marxist's use of the word "alienate" is so sloppy,
urgent, and confused that I can't get much out of it. They tend to
confuse alienation from the product of ones labor (which *I* consider
to be good, natural, healthy, and all that good stuff) with alienation
from ones fellow human being (which I don't care for any more than
they do), and so since they take as one bad thing what I take to
be two different things, one good and one bad, it's hard for me to
make sense of what they say.

Oh, I must have been confused then. No one thing is "all", so I can't
possibly argue against your position if that's the entirety of your
claim.

> eh? what's enlightened ?

The sorts of people with whom one engages in purely and entirely
noncommercial relationships. The sorts of people with whom you never
worry which of you owns a particular item that might be of use to either
of you. Most people in the world only consider their spouse or domestic
partner "enlightened" in this sense. I was using the word half-jokingly,
and I apologize if you found it confusing.

Why not? It goes both ways. The only way you could make a profit from
them is if you did something of service toward them. I guess you're one
of those egoists who never wants to be of service to anyone but yourself
and your personal acquaintances.  ;)

Oh, yeah, and please distinguish between the population of Uruguay and
the government of Uruguay. It's easy (and frequently done) to make a
profit by serving the government of Uruguay while badly disserving the
people of Uruguay. But that's not profit: that's theft, usually
committed in these cases by the government involved.

Me:
I'd say that "commerce is the minimum level of civility with which 
we can, or ought hope to, hold as a standard for dealing with strangers".  
Courteous commerce, not commerce shoved down anyone's throat. 
And that's sometimes a blurry thing, unfortunately (see below).

But we're told the Phoenicians managed it, without even knowing the 
languages of the people they traded with (in some cases, at least).

The source of that civility may be anything, including especially 
compassion. For example, the Rotarians, corny as they may seem.

What an utter stranger needs to know most, however, is not 
"does this unknown person want me to have a wonderful life?" but rather 
"will this person rip me off, or kill me, or enslave me?" 

Or to quote Einstein (possibly apocryphally), "The most important 
question a person can ask is: 'Is the universe a friendly place?'". 

There's friendly-like-Mom-&-Dad, and there's friendly-like-the-nice-
man-behind-the-candy-counter, and there's friendly-like-the-crack-
dealer-down-the-block. Are they interchangeable? Not really. (1) may 
be better than (2), but (2) is better than (3). I think. And these 
are all generalizations, anyway.

Ob Extropian comment, re: "what is enlightenment":
I see the H. accelerans speed-mismatch issue as being one that 
could result in considerable trouble and potential mistrust. 

Consider how irritated some people get when they're stuck in 
traffic after just a couple coffees. Now scale that by two orders 
of magnitude. How pissed-off can someone get in a subjective 
half-hour, waiting for the non-accelerated human in front to 
notice the light has been green for 18 whole objective seconds?

And how tempted to do something impolite and self-serving?

Perhaps enlightenment is that set of qualities that will keep 
accelerated humans from doing such, even when sorely tempted...?

<<

Yes, I think love can be thought of as a business.  I like business and don't
think it is cold and heartless.  I think business is one of the more intimate
relationships you can have with a person.  Business and love can be done on a
one to one, eye to eye basis.  Extropy #3 had an article by Tom W. Bell "Love
as a Contractual Relationship".  He states  an analogy: ". . . feelings are
to love relations as profits are to business relations".  Sometimes you turn
a profit and sometimes not.

I think the point of the "We are all self-employed" is self-responsibility.
 When we hurt someone's feelings we are hurting our "business" of living.  

<< 2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on
trade ?

Yes, it is based on trade:  Married people enter into a contractual
relationship with all the meanings that has.  

<< 3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful
people..."
 
I define it as people who are happy because they have satisfied the four
areas of human happiness: to live well (eat, sleep, shelter, etc.) , to love
(friends, lovers, customers, etc.), to learn (to know things about the
world), and to leave a legacy (to leave their mark on the world.)

<< 4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"
    are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,
    children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???
  >>

We are NOT primarily responsible for other people and here is why:  

We are responsible for ourselves first,  NOT to our neighbors, children,
aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped nor anyone else
first.   If we can not take care of our selves we can not help anybody else.
 "We are all self-employed" meme satisfies the first and basic need, to be
responsible for oneself.   That is the basis of all other help we may then
choose to give others.  

Without the meme _We are all self-employed_  there can be no help given to
anyone in the other groups you mention (friends, neighbors, children, aging
parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped).  

Imagine the alternative meme "We are all NOT self-employed".  To me that
means "It's not MY neck (business) if I get in trouble.  Lets leach off
someone else.  We don't need to be responsible for our own life.  I'll let my
parents, government, religion, charity, neighbors, etc. help me and I don't
need to worry about paying them back (altruism)."    It's a win-LOSE or
lose-win meme, zero-sum game.  "We are all NOT self-employed"  could be the
motto for a communist (or any "Big Brother" style) government or a
socialist-libertarian anarchy.  

"We are all self-employed" is a win-win idea for capitalist or
libertarian-capitalist anarchy.  To get repeat love/business, treat other
people the way you would like to be treated (The Golden Rule).

Why?  Do you have better alternatives?  Better than. . . Capitalism?
What's wrong with consumer choice and the voice of the people?
Don't you agree with private property?
Or is contract law a problem for you?
Or, tort liability?

USSR (past, and for good reason past), Cuba, China and many other nations
don't let the consumer decide anything.  It's all state controlled.
  Contrast the capitalist countries with these.  Where would you want to
live?  No consumer choice, no property, and only contract law based on
government regulation of business deals.  Who has maximized the social
outcomes more?   I admit the US has increased the fascist-socialist
regulations (private property gun control e.g. Republicans) and the Democrats
have reduced freedoms ways resembling communism  (increased taxation used for
welfare programs).   But then, I'm a Libertarian and can see the US slipping
away from "Ian's maximum social outcomes". 

<< how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,

Are you talking about the USSR and China?  They are the lowest standard of
living I can think of in industrialized countries.  They have high poverty
and overflowing prisons.  The "homeless" in the US have the highest standard
of living than in "homeless"any other county.  Even Jesus said the poor, they
will always be with us.

<< Dale Carnegie said a place where "...rich and poor are both free

Dale Carnegie?  Mr. _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  You are free
to be rich or poor, it is up to you.   

 <<some people don't win in a market economy>>

This is not a meaningful statement.  Some people are lazy, stupid or
pessimistic too.    Tell me of a situation were most people win: Anytime you
pay for a product you want more than the money you spend.  For me that's most
of the time.  The fact that I don't "win" every time (Lose-win) makes up for
the times I (Win-Lose).  In general most situations are Win-Win in a market
economy and the standard of living goes up.  You make your own luck and for
some, the standard of living goes down or does so temporarily.

If a business is not compelled to serve the consumer,  the consumer will not
(and should not) buy from that business again.  That business DOES deserve
not getting business again.  Call this an "outcaste" or "hermit" business.
 But you don't have much of a business then do you.  You have killed your own
business.  This was not an initiation of harm except self-inflicted.

After reading my post regarding commerce being basically agreements between 
people to trade and business being a way of organizing resources to achieve 
one's goals, banjo replied:

"OK, several things...
1) you seem to totally integrated the "Human Relations as Commerce" meme.
   By your definition Romantic Love is Business.
2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on trade ?
3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful

4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"
   are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,
   children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???"

Regarding #1:  I'm not saying that all human relations are commerce; I'm 
saying that commerce is an agreement to trade between two or more people.  I 
was saying this to counter the view that commerce alienates people from each 
other.  I think commerce and trading generally bring people together into 
common goals rather than alienating them.  

I would say that Romantic Love has a LOT of similarities to trading, enough 
similarities that I would call it a form of trade.  It is basically an 
exchange between two people, a mutual sharing; and that's all a trade is: a 
mutual sharing.  When I call Romantic Love a form of trade, you probably think 
I am debasing Romantic Love and dragging it DOWN to the level of commerce.  
But what I'm really doing is illustrating how wonderful commerce can be in 
some of it's finer forms.  What I'm trying to do is to get you to reconsider 
your negative view of commerce by showing you one form of commerce which you 
think is wonderful, namely, Romantic Love.  I suppose if you had an orgasm 
every time you bought or sold something, you'd have a very positive view of 
commerce already, just like you do of Romantic Love.

Regarding #2:  No, I am not married or in any sort of romantic relationship 
currently, but if I was, I would view it as being based on the same principles 
that trade is based on: mutual sharing.  When we trade, we are both sharing 
what we have with each other.  Like I've said before, business and trading can 
be warm, dynamic relationships between humans in love, or they can be cold, 
impersonal transfers between people who don't care about each other.  You seem 
to have the view that commerce must remain limited to only the cold, 
impersonal kind.  I prefer to have my commerce be of a warm and loving nature.

Regarding #3:  I define "success" as being able to effectively achieve one's 
desires.  Those who have what they want are successful, and the degree to 
which you are satisfied with your life is your degree of success in your life. 
 Because I desire close and intimate relationships with other humans, I view 
cooperation with other humans as being very important in becoming successful 
in my life.

Regarding #4:  Are we responsible for the lives of those around us who are 
unable to take care of themselves?  First, I would say, we are "responsible" 
for whatever we choose to respond to.  I don't think I or anyone else is 
obligated to respond to the needs of those around us, but anyone can choose to 
respond to those needs, if they want to.  I, personally, have chosen to be 
responsible for the needs of the poor and helpless on this planet.  I did not 
HAVE to make this choice, but I made it because I truly care about other 
people.  

The main cause of poverty, in my opinion, is the poor's lack of the 
appropriate knowledge and skills necessary to create wealth for themselves. 
(And I mean CREATING wealth, by adding value to one's resources through 
intelligence and ingenuity, not just taking it from other people)  To help 
them I am currently becoming highly educated myself and working on developing 
inexpensive and highly effective forms of education that can be easily 
implemented by anyone.  The most important thing, I believe, is to teach 
people how to be self-training and self-motivated, so that they use whatever 
resources available to them to educate themselves and increase the amount of 
resources available to them so they have more to learn from and work with.

Oppression and tyranny also have a lot to do with poverty, but if the people 
were more educated and skillful, it would be much more difficult to maintain a 
tyranny over them and oppress them.

Right.  Multiple personality "disorder" is a very different state from the
"society of mind" multiple personalities some people have talked about here.
 I'm not aware of a precise delineation of the difference between normal
multifacted personality and pathological multiple personality.  I believe the
original question was about the ability of multiple personalities to access
each other's memories.  That, at least, would be one candidate for
distinction; normal people have access to all the memories of all their
personalities, subject to the numerous known imperfections of human memory.
 Multiple personalities have complex shared memories; each personality can
access the memories of some but not all other personalities.  Often memories
are shared mostly in a parentage-type situation; each personality emerges as
a defense mechanism of some other personality (its parent). Each personality
can generally access the memories of its parent and ancestors but cannot
access the memories of its children.  Its ability to access memories on other
lines of descent varies.  The "original" personality, being the one that
starts the whole process, usually can access only its own memories.  There is
usually one personality which can access any memory, but I don't recall any
such for "Eve".

Well, I know quite a bit about computer security myself, at least in one
environment - the MOO.  Due to a number of basic security flaws and
human fallibility, it is generally possible for a sufficiently creative
and clever fellow - such as yours truly - to crack the security without
stepping outside the environment of the MOO.  (Although, of course, I
worked on the side of the angels, attempting to create uncrackable
systems and fair RPG games.)

As I understand it, most modern computer security centers around the
password.  Crackers try to get it, and security folk try to defend it. 
This doesn't much resemble the perversion attacks pictured in
cyberspace, and might not resemble the future.

Cracking a MOO - again, without intercepting a wizard's password or
faking a net packet on a wizardly connection - consists of finding
numerous 'small' conceptual flaws in the system and linking them into a
fatal chain.  Take LambdaMOO's RPG as an example.  One bug I found - and
was made a GM for - involved an unsupervised call to the method
:magic_effect on the room one was in.  In other words, it called the
method and allowed it to alter the amount of magic present without
checking to see who owned the method, whether said player was a GM,
nada.  So of course, any player could hack a :magic_effect on the room
one was in, and cast incredibly powerful spells.

The point of this sad story - and it frankly isn't all that sad, I chose
that bug because it was one of the few that were surface errors rather
than fundamental flaws, and so was fixed and is no longer classified -
is that it doesn't even take an SI to go through MOO security like
tissue paper, just a year or so of experience.  While the computers of
the future are likely to be more secure than MOOs, they are also likely
to resemble the MOO in that they will contain huge masses of slightly
flawed code, and will be cracked or perverted from the inside rather
than the outside.  Forget passwords, forget forged packets; those are
simple problems that will either be solved by encryption or rendered
moot by Deutsch transistors or ansibles or God-knows-what.

A superintelligence, even a new and inexperienced one, will go through
the computer security of the future without even trying.

Unfortunetly the part about sinking into the swamp of metaphysics and
superstition is true. Probably most people will go the way of the gradual
incremental upload due to the fact that people are already thinking about
designing augmentation tools (ie. genetic augmentations for when
genengineering improves, and chips such as British Telecom's vision
recording chip). Also we can pretty-much assume that the tools or knowledge
necessary to detect an individual stream of consciousness will be around
when uploading comes about.

I don't think Eugene actually meant that.  It's not that he didn't see
it as worthwhile in his future life, but that he couldn't see how it could
be relevant at all to the life of *any of us* once we have transcended the
hormone-driven needs of our current bodies.  Since sex is nothing without
hormones (well, nothing short of totally ridiculous :-), I can certainly
see Eugene's point.  Indeed, the point is so strong and simple that to
find an argument why sex might survive the transition isn't easy.  One of
the few arguments I can conjur up is that it might be retained as some
sort of artform or minimalist therapy for those that have religious or
ideological reasons for not accepting the new body controls.  I don't see
why most other people would willingly deny themselves the freedom to move
beyond sexual response (and hence sex) when the opportunity arises.

But surely that's exactly what Eugene is saying!  The horse was superceded
by the motorcar because the horse was made obsolete as a transport system
by the car's far better functionality.  The horse wasn't made extinct nor
illegal to own, and it's still an option to commute to work on it, only
it's far more trouble than it's worth as transport.  The analogy with sex
isn't all that distant, as its possibilities are so limited.

Indeed, but sex seems such a very poor candidate for refining!  In the
presence of immensely superior physical and mental pleasure systems, how
is sex going *not* to become obsolete?  How is it going *not* to be seen
eventually as "that unhygenic thing our ancestors did before they left
behind their primitive animal urges"?  After all, it is *very* similar
to mutual grooming in its binding function, and we've transcended that.

OK, supposing that most people do gradually, incrementally upload.
What happens then?  When you are a computer program running in machine 1,
and you have an opportunity to shut down and start up (where you left
off) in roomier machine 2, will you take it?  Or will you insist on
"gradually, incrementally" moving to machine 2, with first one line of
code, and then another, moving over?

What if you have the option to keep running in machine 1 and also start
up in machine 2?  Are you going to take it, or would you feel better if
your machine 1 program was stopped when the machine 2 program started?

Will the machine 2 program be the same "you" as when you were the machine
1 program, or is it a different program that just thinks it's "you"?

I find that when I think of myself as a program in this way, I am
inclined to believe that my identity is preserved across these kinds
of interruptions and copies.  This leads me to conclude that the same
thing is true about copies which span meat and machine.

That's not "the voice of the people". That translates into a dollar a 
vote. The people with the money get the ability to influence the lives of 
everybody else. So I guess it's the "voice of the people who count"

Oh, great, and The Words of God(tm), are a good basis for dealing with 
society. Why should we accept poverty? If we are talkking about such 
grandiose things as uploading, Dyson Spheres and immortality, why can't 
we discuss utopias for all. It shouldn't be beyond humanity's grasp.

Does that mean they should be ground up by the wheels of the capitalist 
machine? Libertarianism would work if everybody could compete on fair 
terms, but they can't, so some are going to lose all the time.
 
What is considered a fair advantage and what is considered unfair? 

When we get genetic engineering, will genetic flaws be considered an 
unfair advantage?

Businesses can thrive quite well even if they don't serve the consumers.

SOme very good points. I know I get ticked off enough at the idiots in
this world, and I've only got a measly 160 IQ points, with a rather
sedate metabolic rate. Imagine a >H person at 1600 IQ and a speed of 500
MHz, 500 or so teraflops, etc. putting up with your average moron. I
suspect that there will have to be quite a bit of programming going on

is total emotional emasculation, just to keep Omegaman from swatting the
human fly in frustration.

IAN: Sometimes I have to accord myself the luxury of not
documenting ever statement I make. Your questions can only
be answered property from a lengthy inquiry, which it seems
you've yet to begin. But here are quick answers, and they're 
all I've time for:

(1) Poverty is measured by the inability to access resources. 
Laissez-faire capitalism has basically done one thing: maximize
accessibility of resources as a result of free enterprise and 
mass production, founded upon the theory of private property. 
Laws do not and cannot reduced poverty, they can only spread 
it around. 

(2) Homelessness is measured as a condition in which the supply 
of available housing falls below demand. Price controls, such as 
rent controls, are universally correlated to this phenomenon.
Such cantorls are vioaltions of laissez-faire markets.

(3) The penal system overload is a direct result of violations 
of Laissez-faire capitalism, specifically, free trade in drugs.

IAN: It's not a matter of "deserves," it's a matter of fact. 
If I receive no votes, nobody voted for me, ipso facto. Did I 
"deserve" no votes? I guess the whole of the people thought so. 

You see, the position you hold stands at odds with the will of 
the people. If people don't want to vote for someone, the redist-
ributionist will force people to vote for them. That's why the 
redistributors instinctively seek to marshal the weaponry of 
the State to force their neighbors against the threat of physical 
violence to serve their will and to distribute their resources 
according to their plans. I think people do not deserve that.

The allocation of votes -- capital -- should be 
directed by choice not force. That's democracy.

IAN: You claim that it's "not 'the voice of the people'," 
yet you've not presented an argument to support your claim.

You make the claim and then observe that people with money have 
influence. True enough. You then seem to concede my observation
in part, that it's the "voice of people who count."

But after all this, my point that the allocation of capital in 
the market is the voice of the people, still holds. The "people
who count" are the people who the people vote for, the people 
who the people count on. 

I vote for those who most effectively service my needs. A cruel 
task master am I. My ballots are limited only by the degree to 
which I do or do not service the needs of others. Democracy 
cannot possibly give all candidates an equal share of the 
votes, such would be the logical abolition of the demo-
cratic process, and yet that's exactly what the soc-
ialist yearns for.

IAN: We'll just wave our magic wand -- utopias for all 
and for all a central planner. The wonders of magic.

It occurs to me that I presented you with evidence that your anarcho-
socialist ideas required central planners, and you never presented 
a logical argument to defeat that point, in fact I think you just 
avoided it.  Nevertheless, here you are plowing full steam ahead 
with your illogical utopias. This therefore forces me to toward 
the conclusion that your not an honest but a magical thinker.
Did I miss your counter argument?

#1 - Once you are uploaded, an incremental duplication could take
nanoseconds. Maintaining simultaneous existences would simply be a
virtual method of reproduction, in a budding sort of way, while gradual
crossover to new hardware, even if one wished to remain in the same
hardware, would be a method of maintaining the integrity of the self.
Budding is simply making more selves. As nanotech and space migration
increase the resource base, then transhumans can purchase, build,
whatever, the hardware needed to "house" budded selves. As the
technology advances, virtual reproduction in a biological sexual sense
(i.e. melding two genotypes) would create whole new mixtures of
transhuman templates, rather than just copies of old ones. 

Becoming uploaded will enable an entity to reproduce in whatever manner
is most beneficial to the entity at the point in time that the entity
chooses to reproduce.

maybe it's still the little Catholic kid inside me, but I still think
that to not maintain the body/mind awareness through the transfer would
break some sort of link. Even though a flash loaded mind may "think" its
me, I still have doubts. THe human mind runs on too slow a baud rate, in
terms of impulse transfer rate, and even the best silicon/biological
interface will be a tight squeeze for a whole mind at once.

Yes so you say, but what proof do you have to back it up? The Scientific 
Method demands evidence, and in this case you don't have the tiniest particle 
of it, you don't even have unscientific testimonials, every one of the fast 
uploads says everything is fine and they are the same person they  ever were.
             
Unless you believe in the mumbo jumbo that religion has to say about the soul 
(in which case I don't see why you'd be interested in Science or this list), 
consciousness MUST be generated by physical means. All uploads are physical 
systems, if the Scientific Method can not find a difference between an unload 
that is made quickly and one made slowly, then Science says that there is no 
difference.

On the other hand, although the Scientific Method has always worked 
wonderfully well in the past, it has never been proven to work all the time, 
so this doesn't mean I have proven your theory wrong, I have most certainly 
not done that. There are lot's of ideas I can't prove to be false. I can't 
disprove the theory that when uploads are made on Monday Wednesday or Friday 
the person will survive but if the upload is made on Tuesday Thursday or 
Saturday the person will die. That theory and yours have an equal probability 
of being true.

        Who's to say the wealth aren't consumers?  There is so much
discrimination towards the rich and I have never quite understood why.
Generally, the rich *earn* the money that they have.  The 'Ten Pennies In A
Paradigm' thing.  Generally, the poor *don't* earn their money.  Generally,
they rely on either governmental subsidiaries or quarters flicked by the
occasional passerby.  This is a simple concept that many people aren't able
to willingly accept.

P.S.  I *do* mean 'generally'

        Referring to my theory [also a parallel thread running on this
list], I think that both programs would initially be 'you'.  However, once
the machines start running seperately, they begin to have a different
consciousness...or rather, not the same consciousness as the other machine.
To effectively replicate consciousness, initially the consciousness has to
be --again referring to my theory-- reduced into binary form.  Once the
humongous binary snip of consciousness is made and copied repeatedly, it is
then dormant until it is installed and\or loaded.  From the first second
each copy is run, it begins a different stream of consciousness.  For
example, when reduced to binary, it might look like 100011010011010011001010
as opposed to 100011010011010011001011 on the other machine.  Very subtle
difference, but different nonetheless.  This can be because of many things.
If I am applying the 'conscious chip' to an 'android' or mechanical body,
then the initial waking acknowledgements of its wherabouts are going to be
different than the waking acknowledgements of another 'android' with the
same original consciousness.

        Both programs will think that they are "you", though they will be
different.  Their experiences --and yes, I believe experience is a major
portion of defining consciousness-- will begin to vary right from the moment
they are activated.  Both programs will think that they are "you", and both
programs will be correct, though they are different.  Consider it a form of
budding.

        Going back to Hal's original paragraph above, I presume that it
would be best to have a modem-like line constantly transfering "your"
consciousness program on to another computer.  This receptive program must
not be activated during this transfer of binary consciousness.  I hope my
response isn't too confusing, sometimes it's hard to find the words I need
to describe my thoughts...semantic thread anyone?  :-)

Well, right, that's even less than circumstantial.  Motive and method
are also needed.  I'm saying the motive is just that hiding is necessary.
Whether there's a possible method...because we're talking
about civilizations more advanced than our own, we can only ask, can we
prove that it's *not* possible to be computing with (what looks like)
dirt?

By the way, in case I wasn't clear, it isn't that dirt, or any of our
particular surroundings, are what I would expect to see.  "Dirt" is just
my code word for whatever science would lead us to expect are natural
things to see at this stage in the evolution the universe.

If looking like "dirt" is a great advantage, and it's possible,
then I would expect advanced civilizations to look like dirt.

>As you point out, all that sunlight streaming away seems
>inefficient.

Yes.  But maybe that's just the cost of hiding.  Our civilization is
certainly paying the same price without much complaining.  Or, and this
is something I've been thinking since, sunlight may be the dumping of
waste heat.  A little more on thermodynamics below.

Sure, "route around it," in John Gilmore's immortal words.  "To see
the internet in a grain of sand..."

My assumption is that our activities are so gross and slow that they
pose no problem.  Even we humans know how to do distributed computing,
redundancy, moving running processes between processors, etc.  Anyway,
I think we would be part of the computation, whether intended
or noise or bugs.  We don't seem much more troublesome than, let's say,
rainstorms, though.  How to compute with dirt seems much harder than,
"Given I can compute with dirt, what if it gets up and walks?"

>How much physics do you know Steve?

    "...Clever people may learn as much as they wish of the results of

     aberrations of thought which through long training are deeply

     something is unexplained, they grow hot over the first notion
     that comes into their heads and looks like an explanation..."

Well, not enough, but tell me the fastest-reproducing human cell and

Wow, do we?  How does it compare to the computing cost of *simulating*
events at the quantum level, or even at the classical-physics level of,
say, folding proteins?  I know no single number completes the picture--
my point is, it's the *amount* of interaction at various scales that's
interesting, and I was under the impression that our computers have many
orders of magnitude to go before we even start to dent that.  Plus, our
computers are a pretty small fraction of the mass of the solar system.

Whoa.  Computers I know.  It is 1996 and almost all computers have single
processors with clocked logic.  One thing we know is that neither of
those design choices are necessary.  Sure, we know "a lot," but how much
do we know about what all computers *must* look like, under all design
constraints--especially the dirt constraint?

Unless (sorry to repeat) it's strategically necessary to design things
that way.  It might be fun to try to come up with a method for designing
logic circuits where every signal looked as noisy as, say, a feedback
shift register.  By the way, it's looking natural that's the constraint,
not looking like noise.  Orderly or stereotyped patterns--say, the
recurrance of atoms in the periodic chart--are part of looking natural.

>To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an
>optimum design for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.

So I hope I've made my point that you have to look at the driving game
theory, not just 20th century notions of computer design.  If hiding is an
absolute constraint, then efficiency is secondary.  If the most important
measure of "optimum" and "advanced" is whether something looks natural,
dirtlike, then whether it looks "crazy" is also secondary.  Heck, almost
necessary.  Just look at the way bits flow through an encryption algorithm.
[I will not say, "Yeah, crazy like a fox!" as this would spoil the
paragraph.]

I think the right point of view is to look at how much information
is sitting, colliding and moving free at each scale level, and then take
that as the given and design a computer and software (if the two must be
distinguished) to make use of it.  When you're done you know how much
computing you can do--and you (the great intergalactic empire) live with
it.  Them's the breaks, we can't compromise security.  In computing there
are often ways of making use of speed *or* storage space, according to
what's available.  Also ways of trading speed for thermodynamic efficiency.
I imagine aliens with billion-year patience would have extra slack here.

There are also strange tradeoffs in crypto.  Like Chaum's cash protocol
where you can spend money once anonymously, but if you spend it twice you
reveal yourself.  Imagining much more advanced crypto calls into question
what we know about the kinds of computing that need to be done, and also
simple game theory.  For instance, imagine it was possible to cause
something to happen, but not know where it happened.  What would that do
to notions of territory?

The thing I wanted to say about thermodynamics is that calculations of the
kind of computing and communicating you can do depend on the background
noise, or temperature.  When trying to figure out how much computing dirt
or stellar plasma is doing, there is a problem: are those particle
motions really random?  To what extent?  If someone could throw off the
motions they didn't want and replace them with motions they intended, then
the effective temperature for the users and outside observers would be
different.  That would change how much computing would seem possible.

(The other cryptocosmology quip: "God is in the least significant bits.")

I don't know whether physics would let this kind of temperature
difference exist for long, or at what cost.  Imagine (metaphorically)
extremely cold parts moving extremely fast in an extremely well-designed
machine.  Does physics let you keep that up without friction "melting the
parts" quickly, even with refrigerators?  Even with, say, big systems in
known quantum states (setups too perfect for us to imagine making)?

The sun's light might plausibly be refrigerating the sun.  Not so plausibly
the planets.  Of course sunlight can power planetary refrigerators, but so
few of those BTUs are falling on planets.  This really makes suns
look like the place to compute, except that plasma is even more unruly than
people (or is it?).  Maybe planets are very very slow mass storage, doing
processing only in order to store and retrieve and refresh.  But then there's

Planets and suns both seem to have it over interstellar gas and dust because
they're compact, but considering what I said about speed/storage tradeoffs,
and also all that mysterious free-range sunlight, there could be something
going on there.

If we want to think about advanced civilizations, I think we need
to recognize what a wildcard that "advanced" is.
Cryptocosmology says They might need to evade probes like science.
At best we can ask whether computing is possible in "dirt" *as we know it*.
If not, the Great Filter has more plausibility.
If so, there's a giant "OR...NOT" thrown into the picture, with no
probability assigned at this point, but it would make some questions
in crypto and game theory more interesting.

I don't beleive the mumbo jumbo, however, you have not presented ANY
evidence that the original entity, the meaty one, will not have an
abrupt cessation of awareness of this universe, i.e. death. I would
agree to the assertion that the uploaded mind would have a continuous
stream of awareness from bio to electro, but any perfect copy should by
definition do so. You have not presented any evidence that if I were to
do a flash upload, that my "stream of conciouness" that I consider to be
"me" would not cease, even though there would be a perfectly operating
electronic copy of me insisting that it feels fine.

Since we are nowhere near the technological level to do any of this, it
is rather a waste of breath to continue arguing about it, since neither
of use knows enough to make an informed statement as to its truth or
veracity. And in any case, I believe that the technology for slow
gradual uploads will develop much sooner than a flash upload capability. 

Frankly, you sound more like a religious dogmatic, willing to take a
leap of faith, than I. I at least want to test the waters first, to make
sure it works. Tell me: Are you so positive that you would flash upload
this instant, given the chance?

People with money do not neccessarily get it from the majority of people.

You have more ballots than most people. If you become rich enough, it
doesn't matter what other people think, you can impose your will on them. 
That's what I think will happen with unrestrained capitalism. You will
either get an dictatorial oligarchy with more money than everybody else,
or you willget a traditional Marxist revolution type thing. I don't like 
either ofthose things.

Going back through the posts I think it was you who dropped off the
argument.

Why is an utopia illogical? 

 I'm advocating voluntary socialism, pretty much. No I can't
impose this by force, because that's just not right. 

I like democracy, but only when there's options for the minority as well
as the majority. 

Okay, thought experiment:

We get rid of all coercive institutions, both government and corporations.
Then we see what social structures turn up. You say the natural
relationship between humans is trade. I say it's cooperation. I
think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary
success. 

Only when a small minority obtain power through generally nasty means, can
they tell everybody else that these are the rules they must follow.     

Why do you equate the desire for a good life for all with central
planning. I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also
hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their
advertising and poison my water with their pollution. Uggh, there must be
a better way than unrestrained capitalism.

This "sex is obsolete" thread reminds me of an old original Star Trek
episode. It was the one where 3 highly advanced beings held their
consciousness in spheres for thousand of years, waiting for someone to
come and help build android bodies for them.
One line I remember, from the being Sargon, was "There was a time in our
history where we dared think of ourselves as Gods." :)
They wanted to assume physical form in order to reexperience the
pleasures of physical touch & intimacy.
I hope a post-human state of existence gives us a choice to experience
the pleasures of life in all forms.

How are corporations coercive again? Governments are fundamentally
coercive, right down to their root. Big corporations usually avail
themselves of government coercion (so does nearly everyone who
votes), but I don't see any deep connection between the notion of
a corporation and the use of force. A corporation is just a form
of voluntary association.

Where did you get the idea that trade is not a form of cooperation?
I've got A and you've got B and I like B better than A and you like
A better than B and so we trade, and both benefit. Win/win.
Cooperation.  Human beings spent most of their evolution living in
small tribes, cooperating with the members of their tribe and
ignoring or competing with all other human beings. But we don't
live in tribes anymore (or at least, we need to cooperate with more
people than just the people we know personally). Trade is the method
we've evolved for cooperating with all the other people in the
world. Trade is a method of cooperation that you can use with people
that you don't know well enough to trust to cooperate with in any
other way.

Desire for your own good life doesn't imply central planning, but
desire for strangers to lead a good life (beyond simply attending
to their desires, which is just trade) does imply central planning.
It does so because desire for strangers to lead a good life (again,
other than simply sometimes doing what they want you to do) implies
that you can know what constitutes a good life for anyone other
than yourself and those you know very well.  Lately, I have become
convinced that it is impossible for me to know what constitutes a
good life for anyone other than myself.

As for lying advertising, I hate it too, but corporations are hardly
the only ones who lie. Lying goes much deeper than such shallow
and recently invented social structures.  The lying that you see
emanating from corporations is, ultimately, committed by individuals
within the corporations. It is so difficult to say, after all, what
exactly honesty might mean as long as we still relegate the question
"What is truth?" to the philosophers instead of trying hard to
decide for ourselves. And also, I don't know about you, but I find
that I have a very difficult time distinguishing between stupidity
and lies. Left-anarchism isn't going to be able to magically do 
away with stupidity.

And as for the water... did you actually experience corporate
pollution in your water, and did you personally trace the causality
behind that directly to some evil corporation, or is it possible
that you are repeating things you've been told without thinking
through all the reasons why you might have been told them?

IAN: That's what they once said about regular toothbrushes. Because
those people didn't stop laissez-faire capitalism then, now even the 
"poor" can afford toothbrushes. If we don't stop capitalism now, 
the same thing will happen again.

IAN: If people share your fear, nobody will get that many votes.
They can only "impose their will" once they start to buy up all the 
land.  Buying off and then growing the govt is the logical course 
to take, and the most effective pretext for growth is socialism.
So the logical course is anti-socailism, or laissez faire.

IAN: Your saying that capitalism will lead to either [1] socialism
or [2] socialism so we would be better off with socialism.

The fact is that both varieties of socialism you fear -- both 
rule by a central cabal -- are achieved only by means antithetical 
to capitalism, so there is a clear path: laissez faire.

 > Going back through the posts I think it was you who dropped off the

IAN: Your argument that no central planner is needed because people 
will "keep tabs on each other" was the last point I saw you make. 
It could work only in one small community where each person 
could visually inspect the wealth of their neighbors, and 
hold them to task for any evidence of more wealth than average. 

I explained several other reasons why this is untenable and
am not aware of your counter to those points.  Since it 
seems you are, you could forward it to me if you like.

IAN: If its goal -- equalization of wealth -- violate it's 
tenants -- liberty -- as in the case of "anarcho-socialism,"
then it's illogical.

Nope, i'd define one of those egoists as someone who'd never help another
unless they profited by it.  
it seems to me that the opposite of "egoist" would be "selfless",
as in "her selfless actions brought hope to many".

incorrect, the _We are all self-employed_ meme (M:WaaSE), is being discussed
as being useful to propagate, therefore it is not now universally current.
But being responsible for others in our communities is (where i come from)
a common even old fashioned idea.  Therefore we do not require M:WaaSE to
exist for help to be given.

And if M:WaaSE was dominant, would people give aid if it didn't return a 
profit ?

A simple alternative is meaningless.
The alternative to "Always help those in need" (Saintliness) 
is "Never help those in need", i would not advocate either.

Also, by your own argument above, would not a more useful meme (and one fairly
current) be "I am responsible for my own life".

I come from a thriving Social Democratic society, at our last election, 
3 weeks ago we had a turnout in the high 80's (%), we have fairly 
universal (if somewhat abraided by New Right Economics) health care 
and Social Welfare.

New Zealand is a bloody wonderful country, with a strong history of
middle of the road Liberal/Socialist policies.  Pure Libertarianism
Capitalism may be a workable system (tho' i doubt it), but i know by
looking around me that it ain't the only way that works.

"he who has the gold makes the rules"

As an excercise, may i suggest that you visit several different public
places and observe.  Check out a Library, a beach, a playground,
a supermarket and your family home.   Watch peoples' behaviour,
is every relationship a business relationship ?  or are there more
economical (using Occams razor) explanations and models ?

I never mentioned alcoholism as dependent on the state of the economy.
But come to think of it, i suspect you'll find that there are statistical
correlations between Unemployment levels and, Violent Crime, addiction rates,
suicides and mental illness.

I strongly disagree.  By your argument, if we exterminated those losers
who "choose" to be poor, then we'll have "solved" poverty.

Yep, extremist-woolly-liberal middle-of-the-road socialism.
Not State Socialism.

Actually i take Mr Proudhons' stance that Property (in Capitalist terms)
is Theft.  If a mining company discovers, claims and mines a large seam of 
coal, then i believe that they have stolen it from me and by implication,
the everybody else (aka The People).

Communism, State Socialism isn't the only form of Socialism.
It's unsophisticated and only useful for controlling peasant economies.
There are many sucessful countries that are Socialist, look to Scandinavia,
Australasia etc

Taxing the rich (a little) to aid the poor (a little) is not Communism.

Im not against a market economy, but i feel that, like all things, it should
be applied in moderation.

Your argument that some people "are lazy, stupid or pessimistic too", implies
the Calvanist doctrine that the rich deserve to be praised for the wonderful
qualities that made them rich, and that the poor must be chastized for the
being the worthless slobs that they self-evidently are.

maybe we should drop this or take it to private email, 
is this on-topic for extropians ?

Some argumentation is required, agreed. (though I consider the fact being

Alas, I don't think I (nor anybody else) will have much to say in the 
matter, at least not for long... Mind ecologies will have their own 
dynamics, impose its own set of constraints upon its denizens -- whether 
they like it or not.

I don't think the uploads will be able to afford conventional (simulated 
flesh) sex much longer. If we assume resources to be limited (unless 
computation can be detached from the material carrier and we start 
engineering our designer universes) _and_ we admit Darwinian evolution in 
(it will be impossible to keep him out, I'm afraid -- notice that this 
automagically introduces some form of death, or do we speak Lamarckian 
evolution here, where mutation leaves the organism altered, but alive-o?), 
we'll wind up having scarce resources, more sooner than later. Some of them 
being time (attention devoted, etc), computation, whatever.

Burning computational resources for body dynamics, fakespace renderers, 
etc. might become too costly, once entire system matter has been 
converted into a Dyson shell computer (very soon, <<1 kYr), and this 
mind substrate dish populated sufficiently densely (much faster, <<1 Yr).

Please observe the caveat in the original post. If we have sexual
autoreplication (chimaeric offspring generated from two or more 
contributors), we will have a form of sex. Since I (extremely 
unscientifically) conjecture we'll stick with emotions, the act will be 
probably emotionally loaded (since emotions probably cause us to act at 
all).

As I said, the substrate is different, yet it still has its constraints. 
Maybe, as Anders once said, we'll keep our olfactory bulbs & Co, as a 
fundament for otherwise streamlined structures... I do not know.

Democracy is generally seen as the ideal political system by most of 
the western world, but does it make evolutionary sense ?  

Democracy says that all parts of this complex organism 
called society have a say in how it grows.  That is to say that a 
plumber, a mathematician, a poet and a politician all have the same 
ability in judging what is best for the whole of society.  
Specialization of this skill makes a whole lot more sense to me.  
As an analogy one can see in the human organism, that it is our brains 
which "decide" where we are heading in our evolutionary jungle, 
although it depends on the correct functioning of the other organs, 
they do not participate in the decision process.

The ideal situation for maximum growth would be to have people who 
know what the best evolutionary paths are, in power.  Democracy's 
answer to the question of "how do we decide who knows best ?" is 
simply to say that it'll take the average of all human decisions 
(including the bad ones).  
To me, it makes more sense to have a dictator in power.  The method 
of his ascension will not be voting, but rather becoming a leader 
because of his success in the free market.

Leaders will autoevolve in a free market system, without the 
artificial intervention of democracy.

There are still people out there who can't afford toothbrushes, but 
that's a different story. The average standard of living has improved, 
but the average poor person lives in much the same way they did 200 years 
ago, with a few more perks. While the rich standard of living has 
increase, say , by a hundred fold, the poor standard of living has 
increased maybe three fold.

Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?
They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it. 
THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they 
don't need anybody else's.

How will laissez faire prevent those things from happening? Either the 
workers and the poor, of which there will be far more, will revolt as 
Marx predicted. Or the powerful will have such control that the 
peop[le won't be able to revolt. Laissez faire will not move wealth 
around. It will centralize it into the hands of the most ruthless or capable.


Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different. 
Batista, Duvalier, Suharto, and Duarte all ran with capitalism, and yet 
they were, (still are in the case of Suharto), completely totalitarian. 
This is because the government was run for and by the private interests. 
Which is what I think happens with laissez faire.

I live in Canada, which is a fairly good  liberal socialism. I agree with 
Banjo that capitalism needs a bit of government in order to keep it from 
running amuck.

But it doesn't. The freedom to do what you choose is still there, but of 
course there are limits, because then you impinge on the freedom of 
others. There is more freedom than capitalism because noone can tell you 
what to do (with you having to take it, with no reasonable alternatives). 
There is also mroe equality. Of course it's not a perfect system. But I'd 
like a system that is flexible enough to meet the problems it runs into 
without too much bureaucratic  procrastination.

Well, no. Because the business interests have so much power, i think we 
need to get a strong populist government. The emphasis on the word 
populist. It's a neccessary evil to counteract another evil.

Suresh Naidu said, to Ian Goddard, "You say the natural relationship between 
humans is trade. I say it's cooperation."

Suresh, if you want food and I want a house, and we each have what the other 
wants, when we make a trade with each other, isn't this cooperation?  I don't 
see how you can maintain that trade isn't cooperation, when it most clearly 
is.  In a trade, all parties are cooperating with each other for everyone's 
benefit.  This is cooperation.  This is working together to achieve common 
goals.  I'm not sure why you refuse to see that.  

In trading and in the capitalist system, only those who are willing to 
cooperate with others can make any money.  In the capitalist system, people 
don't trade unless they will get something in return that they value at least 
as much as what they're giving up.  This means that those who don't offer 
others value don't profit from the capitalist system.  This means that 
non-cooperative behaviour is AUTOMATICALLY cast out of the capitalist system, 
by its very nature.  

In the capitalist system, those who don't pull their own weight don't get a 
ride.  In other words, unless you help people, they won't help you.  Thus, the 
capitalist system is cooperative AT EVERY TRANSACTION.  Certainly you don't 
advocate a system of "cooperation", where a lot of people who are able to work 
don't contribute to society but still receive the benefits of other's work.  
These people would not be cooperating with the rest of society; they would be 
parasites.  The capatilist system has a very elegant way of getting rid of 
parasites; no one will trade with them because they have nothing to offer in 
return. (Although truly helpless people are often given assistance by those 
with kind hearts)

The capitalist system is ENTIRELY about cooperation.  It is the best system of 
cooperation that exists.  Every act of trade is an act of cooperation.  Those 
who aren't willing to cooperate won't be able to find anyone to trade with.  
Thus, the capitalist system encourages people to cooperate, and the more they 
cooperate with others, the more they are rewarded.

Suresh, you reveal what you truly are against with this sentence: "But I also 
hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their advertising 
and poison my water with their pollution."

You are against lies and pollution, according to this statement.  Yes, some 
businesses do pollute and do lots of other awful things, but that is no reason 
to get rid of businesses and the capitalist system entirely.  It would be like 
killing all humans because some of them do terrible things.  

You are not really against the capitalist system, because it is EXACTLY the 
type of massive, large scale cooperation that you have been advocating.  You 
are against people cooperating with each other to pollute and to lie to other 
people.  Unless you get clear about what the real enemy is, you're like a 
blind soldier, wandering around the battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy 
alike.  

The capitalist system is fundamentally a GOOD thing; it is about people coming 
together, by mutual agreement, and trading what they have with each other.  It 
is also a good way of insuring that those who refuse to contribute to society 
don't get to benefit from it either (unless someone chooses to give them 
something).  

Get clear about what you're REALLY against, and attack THAT; don't attack 
people for engaging in the peaceful activities of helping each other by 
exchanging goods and services.  By attacking the capitalist system, you attack 
the very thing you advocate; cooperation.

         First of all, who here, assumes that sex, or
uploaded simulation of, requires a flesh simulation?
We can understand that "mind" itself can experience
orgasm, in a 'wet dream' why must the uploads be 
in flesh form to trade the impulses, electro
chemical or neuro connected (glandular) versions 
of the pleasant, visual "fireworks " of orgasm or
pleasureable contact? In this case I wonder if you
are missing the point entirely of being "uploaded".
The idea of uploading assumes computational 
abilities which can carry an intelligence, a human
personality which we can *recognize as us* into an
environment. If we do want to retain some human 
elements, it may be neccessary to emulate some 
hormonal action- remember this thread started with
Rich, who seems to think men are pretty much
hormone driven creatures; - )
How much bandwidth to simulate the impulses of the hypothalamus? In our
current  "WETWARE", it takes up
only about one three hundredth of the brain.


>>>_and_ we admit Darwinian evolution in 
(it will be impossible to keep him out, I'm afraid -- notice that this 
automagically introduces some form of death, or do we speak Lamarckian 
evolution here, where mutation leaves the organism altered, but alive-o?), 

I'm afraid Lamarckian evolution finally  may
have it's day in any conscious software that can
reprogram itself at will.

>we'll wind up having scarce resources, more sooner than later. Some of them

Not enough bandwidth for VR? I notice there is no talk
here of what TYPE of upload, dry, semi-soft, wet... 
In neural activity, things move rather quickly, and
upload time will be at least as fast, a healthy sexual encounter may be
considered leasurely and lengthy
if it takes a second....

>>>Burning computational resources for body dynamics, fakespace renderers, 
etc. might become too costly, once entire system matter has been 
converted into a Dyson shell computer 
(very soon, <<1 kYr), and this 
mind substrate dish populated sufficiently densely (much faster, <<1 Yr).
 

You know this to be the only future? How so?
Even Moravec doesn't put too much faith in this.. 
I think he called Dyson's ideas "new and half baked..."
these are lovely ideas, but hardly concrete.
but even if it is so certain in your mind...

... why this attachment to replication and body? dont you enjoy a good

IAN: The flaw in your experiment is the baseless assumption 
that cooperation is the antithesis of trade. The error is quite
clear to see: "cooperation" implies consent. Consent implies 
the freedom to say no.  Therefore, I will "cooperate," or
say "yes," when I find the terms to be suitable = trade.

gaining such power to compel such surrender to the collective?

IAN: But why should they keep all the pollution to themselves? They're 
spreading it around.  It's a collectivist duty to take on your share. 
It's your petty bourgeois notions of private property that cause you 
to entertain such bourgeois notions as "pollution."

Rich had suggested I'd misunderstood you, and that you were saying not that
sex would be abolished, but that it would take more subtle and controllable
forms. From your response, it seems that you *were* indeed talking about
abolition. Sex will go because we won't be able to afford the resources.

This is the point that I find highly unlikely. I agree that many posthumans
may choose to use their computational resources for other things ("sex? --
been there, done that"). However, I seriously doubt this will be due to
Darwinian competition leading to scarce resources. The trend has always been
to effectively *less* scarce resources. As technology continues to develop,
I see no reason to expect that trend to reverse. 

Actually, I can see that *maybe* the first uploads might not be able to
afford to simulate bodies and bodily experiences, though soon that would
become affordable. Even with early uploads, I suspect (but cannot
demonstrate) that simulating much of bodily experience in some form will be
desirable and probably necessary. Psychologically, most people will *want*
to have the experience of bodies when they first upload, even if they later
feel comfortable changing that. (Even they will no doubt avail themselves of
the ability to select which bodily sensations they experience, when, and to
what degree.)

So, my basic disagreement is with your view that resources will be scarce.
If at all, I see that as plausible only for the first early uploads. I see
computational resources gettting less scarce over time.

We've been discussing uploading and whether the upload is really the person 
who was uploaded, or whether they are some new person who only thinks they are 
the original person.

First of all, if we're assuming that we can be uploaded into a computer in the 
first place, we are assuming that our consciousness is basically a type of 
computer program.  A computer program can be looked at as a way of 
transforming numbers into other numbers.  In the case of a person's 
consciousness running on a computer, the computer would be transforming a very 
LONG and complex number into another very long and complex number from moment 
to moment.  It doesn't matter how long the moments are in between 
transformations of the numbers that represent the process of someone's 
consciousness, it only matters that the same process is being carried out.  An 
interruption of a million years would make no difference to the upload, if 
they carry on then just as they were before.  The "stream of consciousness" 
doesn't have to be flowing all the time; it can stop and start, but as long as 
it always picks up right where it left off, it is still the same "stream of 
consciousness".  As long as uploading faithfully copies the computational 
process that is your consciousness, you will be uploaded AS you.  There may be 
disagreement about how accurately an uploading process can copy your 
consciousness however.  But as long as it doesn't alter it any more than it 
typically gets altered in the normal course of events, I see no way to argue 
that the upload isn't as really you as you are.  But, we'll just have to wait 
around and see how good the technology is (of course, those of us who are 
interested should actually get out and work on this technology, rather than 
sitting around waiting for someone else to do it).

Now you are saying the wealthy can't be customers in your society!?  It would

You don't want _anybody_ to be wealthy.  No matter how hard they work.  You
want us all to be equally poor.  You want class warfare?  And, you want the
poor to win so that there are only poor people left in your society?

What's wrong with that?  Isn't the whole idea to make something your
customers can afford?  

You want me to make only things that _who_ wants?  Only the people who can't
afford it?  I guess airplanes, cars, Ringworld, computers and spacecraft are
out of the picture in your society.  

So in your society I can sell ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T afford it.  It is
illegal for me to sell to a person who CAN afford to pay.   You don't want me
to sell _anything_ do you?  You don't believe in ANY private property at all.
 

It's probably also illegal for me to work for a rich business person.

IAN: That molecule already exists. See the works of Timothy Leary, 
a strong proponent of space exploration, both external and internal. 
However, people with big sticks are payed to track down and destroy 
the space exploration molecule and all who posses it.  Indeed,
this keeps the serfs and their minds "down to Earth."

what we can and get on with our own lives.  Don't drag the society down to
the level of the poorest of poor.   Compassion yes, charity yes,  but I have
a life to live also.

Socialism helps people remain lazy by giving them something for no work, e.g.
nothing in return.   Give them a Freeman Dyson Sphere,  a Dan Anderson Double
Dyson Sphere, or a Larry Niven Ringworld and there will still be homeless,
lazy, poor, and fun-loving people who don't like to keep track of or make

Capitalism lets people free themselves from geography by creating means to
move and choose where you want to go.  I don't know of any capitalistic
society that forbids travel or even travel out of the capitalistic society.
 I do however know that socialistic governments place travel restrictions
even within their own borders.  In this way a capitalistic society is closer
to libertarianism than a socialistic government.

People born handicapped were killed in the (very socialistic) USSR and Nazi a
Germany.  I don't know of any capitalistic government that has ever done
that.  I fact there are many non-government groups in capitalistic countries
that help the poor, handicapped, jobless, homeless.  I see no reason to go
back to a socialistic government where those private groups are outlawed and
only the government rules.  I don't see charities decreasing in capitalistic
countries and see no reason why they would decrease in a
libertarian-capitalist society.

I have seen people "ground" into submission by governments but they always
seem to be the socialist governments.  Socialist governments want all people
to be equal, equally poor, starving, no rich at all.  The only exception I've
seen is the Swiss were everyone is equally rich. They don't let anyone enter
their country and become a citizen that is poor.

Centralized government or centralized business is a great problem.  When
either gets too much power the people can not negotiate a free and prosperous
life.  Perhaps you are talking about "centralized (business monopoly)
capitalism".  If so, we agree on that one point, at least.

<<Libertarianism would work if everybody could compete on fair 
 terms, >>

Decentralization helps because it lets people negotiate their choices with
many different other people.  The central authority does not control.  If you
don't like the people you are dealing with, go to the next one.

<<but they can't, so some are going to lose all the time. >>

"Some people will lose all the time" to me is a meaningless statement.  Some
people we call "just plain losers".  Some people are lazy, stupid or
uneducated.  And, some people will not help themselves no matter what you do
for them. 

Some people will not choose to help themselves no matter what you give them
to make things equal.  Equality is not a stable state if people choose to
work harder than other people.  Soon they gain the fruits of their labor and
everything is unequal again (poorer vs. richer).  If one person learns more
than the next. . . you no longer have intellectual equality (educated vs.
uneducated).   China tried this and the educated scientists cleaned toilets.
  Did the uneducated make a new scientific discoveries?  You should not force
equality anymore than you force people to do anything else.  China had a
disaster when they tried. They chose to stop the "inequality" of intellect.
 Ironically they got an _Atlas Shrugged_Ayn Rand disaster of their own
making.      

Equality is not the answer.  It's too unstable.  The minute everything is
equal, things change and the society spontaneously drifts out of that
unstable state.

everyone, and so it will benefit me to teach lots of others how to create 
wealth for themselves (then there will be more people creating high-quality 
products for me to trade with).  The only way we can all be wealthy is if 
everyone learns to create their own wealth.  It won't happen by redistributing 
the wealth that some create to those who don't create wealth.  Everyone must 
take responsibility for their own lives and use the resources they have to add 
value to everything they can.  That is how we create wealth.

I can see your point in cases involving natural resources, such as land and 
water and coal and mineral ores and so forth.  I can kind of agree that these 
should be considered to belong to everyone.  But when I create something of 
value with everyone's natural resources, what I create is mine.  My work is 
mine.  Sure, we all share mineral ores, but if I go through all the work of 
mining the ore and refining it and designing an automobile and building it, 
then the part of the car that I am responsible for creating is mine alone.  
The materials that the car is made of may belong to everyone, and perhaps I 
should pay some small rent to everyone to use those materials, but no more 
than someone who has a big pile of unrefined ore in "their" backyard.  When I 
create useful objects, their utility is my creation, and I own that; the 
usefulness is something that I personally added; it is not the creation of 
everyone, and so it does not belong to everyone.

Natural resources may belong to everyone, but the value added to the natural 
resources belongs to those who add that value.

It is important that we interact with each other in ways which respect that.  
Redistributing someone's work without their consent is theft.

I have NEVER been to a government run facility where I was communicated
with in a freindly manner, or treated in any way like I was a human
being. Unfortunately, I cannot take my government business elsewhere, as
they currently enforce their monopoly quite strictly (i.e. Waco, Ruby
RIdge, Justus Township), so they are not motivated to act any
differently. I can however go into any type of business I choose for the
products or services I need, and if I don't like even the smallest bit
of  my experience there, I can walk out any time I want to. I also grew
up in a small town, of less than 10,000 people. However I grew up when
people in this town still felt they had to be civil to each other, this
is slowly not becoming the case, as people from states and cities where
they have let governments have overrun their lives are moving here, and
are bringing the same cancer with them. I guess the 90's haven't gotten
to New Zealand yet.

now you're being ludicrous.  you obviously have no idea of where the
rich people get their money from. The overwhelming majority of wealth in
this country is in real estate. Something which EVERYONE needs. If
someone makes an ugly house, on a toxic waste dump, its not gonna sell,
and if it does, they won't be in business too long after.

no one will voluntarily become a slave. Socialism enslaves people to the
will of the majority in power.

Free market does not care what you look like, what you beleive, etc..
What it cares about is 1)what can I do for you today? (when was the last
time you saw a gov't bureaucrat say that with a smile?) 2) When do you
need it? and 3) How much do you want to pay for it? If an equitable
voluntary agreement is reached on those terms, then a sale is made, and
a consumer is happy.  Free market breeds hapiness.  Ask any salesman,
who is not just out to make a buck, but a real salesman, what they like
the most about their jobs, and 9 times out of 10 they'll say they like
making people happy.  Bet you can't get the same response from 10
bureacrats.

Freemarket capitalism means there is a nich for everyone and the
cumulative demands of individuals motivate producers to produce as much
as is neccessary, unlike in an oligopoly or socialist state, where one
size fits all, and if there isn't enough, too bad.

Fortunately, we are working on just that. haven't you noticed that since
government has deregulated businesses that 1) prices have gone down, and
2) they've gotten a lot more sensitive to consumer pressure to do the
right thing.

Sorry, the USSR and East Block countries made much bigger messes of
their environment than any western country ever did. You just don't hear
abou them much because of the secrecy of those governments, and a media
bias not wanting to make leftists look like bigger polluters than big
bad capitalists.

More environmental cleanups and preventions have happened in the west
because business has become more responsive to consumer disgust with
pollution. WHy? because business, more than ever, HAS to. The government
approved monopolies like AT&T, Cable, Elecrtic Utilities, etc. are no
more, and industry must compete for public approval, or risk wholesale
boycotts by consumers. This IS what a free market is about.

Naturally, unrestrained capitalism is NOT the same as free market
capitalism. Unrestrained capitalism is unresponsive to consumers (see
what happened to IBM? Evolution in action).  Free Market capitalism is
totally responsive to consumers. A free market also means there is room
for private nonprofit type advocacy groups, like Greenpeace, etc.  THis
has always been available in market economies, and not in socialist
ones. You can go back to the early church, which provided services to
the sick and poor when the feudal government would not.

I highly recommend that rather than being a "sometime math student" that
you make a full time study of economics before you come back here with
your drivel.

Nobody forced any one to drink. Its a voluntary action. The number one
quote of the addict is "I can quit anytime I want to" and they can. I
did. Someone who chooses to keep enjoying the effects of a substance
which ruins their lives obviously gets more out of the substance in
value than they lose elsewhere, so they are voluntarily accepting the
cost of their actions.

The contention that alcoholism is genetic is highly debatable, ANYONE
can becoe an alcholic. The wilingness to remain one is more a matter of
nurture than nature.
>

I did. 2/3 of the homeless in America are substance abusers, i.e.
addicts. The majority of which have alcohol as their drug of choice.
Ergo, homelessness, once you understand the process of alcoholism, is a
natural funtion of substance abuse, and not the state of the economy.

Well we've certainly proven that the opposite isn't true. We've spent
more on welfare in the last 20 years than on all the wars we've ever
fought, and there's more poor people than ever. Simple biology, you feed
a culture, and it grows. You kill it, it doesn't grow any more. However,
I DO NOT advocate this sort of policy with humans. I do advocate a
policy of cutting off the feed trough. THey have no right to feed off of
my productivity without my approval, just as I don't have a right to go
around with an uzi cleaning up the garbage.

Really, I never saw a title with your name on it. If the people pass a
law establishing the mineral claims system, then YOU voted on it buddy.
Funny though, I don't see you saying that income tax is theft, though.

Actually, the original term was better and more succinct: "Stealing from

Very interesting experiment.  After much consideration, I look at it 
this way:

After one duplicate was killed, from your viewpoint, no one would 
have died.  
>From the viewpoint of some observers, however,  you did die.
I guess this would mean that the consciousness of the observers would 
no longer be synchronized between the two worlds, since you are dead 
and not dead at the same time to the observers, depending on who you 
ask.

I believe incremental replacement of individual brain components is 
completely feasible.  After all, the brain is a fault-tolerant, error 
correcting design.  This would be the easy part though.  Extending an 
architecture never designed to be extended would be a much more 
difficult pursuit.  Beyond simple component for component 
replacement, high level architectural augmentation should be extremely 
difficult.

I was saying that you cannot produce a physical or spatial translation of 
information without also producing an equal physical or spatial

This is a physical context, not an information context.  You are 
generating a copy of the output of Turing machine A on Turing machine 
B.  The information that is output by Turing machine A exists as soon 
as it is generated.  The problem of copy latency is a physical one, 
not an informational one.

Nothing murky about this at all.  This is a very basic theorem that 
has been proven in very concrete terms.  There are many similar 
theorems.  A large areas of information theory is counter-intuitive.  

The science as a whole is very practical and is generally used in the 
design of complex, distributed information systems.  Large-scale 
distributed databases and distributed operation systems use this 
area of mathematics extensively.  In its full scope it also includes 
topics such as data compression and cryptography.

Another interesting mathematically proven theorem of information 
science:  It is mathematically impossible for an information agent 
(such as humans or computers) to prove that their information is 
synchronized with that of another information agent.

The above theorem is also counter-intuitive (with many implications) 
but true nonetheless.   In the real world, distributed systems assume 
synchronization because they can't really know.  Humans also "assume" 
synchronization, often called "common knowledge".

Your consciousness is interrupted, but not terminated.  Our minds, 
like most modern operating systems, are event-driven and capable of 
running more than one process at the same time, some in the 
background, some in the foreground.  If this was not the case, you 
would have to think about breathing to make it happen, and a 
phone call would make you forget to breathe.

Information exists in the physical universe, but it has no physical 
properties. There is a big difference.  There is no 
difference between originals and copies.  The problem starts when 
consciousness comes into play.  If you think of your mind as an 
instance of a very complex block of information, you create a 
situation where a block of information contains the ability to 
recognize the difference between itself and all other copies of 
itself via the mechanism of self-awareness.  Self-awareness allows 
a block of information to uniquely recognize itself without necessarily having 
any differences between itself and it's copies.  

Yes, the copies may be identical, but to the self-aware, they are not 
the same as itself.  Other self-aware, exact copies would be 
identical to each other from its own viewpoint, though.

2 + 2 = 4 is hard to destroy for a number of reasons.  Mostly, 
though, it is because it is thoroughly encoded on many, many 
substrates throughout the universe.

As for Shakespeare, you wouldn't know who Shakespeare was if every 
bit of information on Shakespeare was destroyed, and therefore, you 
couldn't "rediscover" the information.  Rediscovery requires prior 
knowledge hence the information could not have been completely 
destroyed.  The monkey might 
bang out plays, but they would no longer be Shakespeare's plays 
because there would be no evidence in the universe that Shakespeare 
ever wrote a play.  They would be random noise generated by a monkey 
pounding on a typewriter.

How information is encoded is irrelevant to the information itself.  
Information *can* be encoded in two different ways, and usually is.  
The way your mind stores a block of text is very different than the 
way it is stored on a page, but the information content is the same 
either way.

I think that we will have the most enjoyable sex anyone has ever had on the
planet when we're uploaded including sharing memories but we will need to
ration it to avoid people  becoming stuck in endless loop scenarios. We
could even plug an "ah-ha!" euphoria into uploads on request.

Won't work because builtin commands such as 'dir' are run before any
executables so this approach wouldn't work and besides, most people running
windows don't tinker in dos anyways so that would limit the spread to
people who actually use dos.

Dictators _do_ get alot accomplished and if you have a good dictator or
king, the populous prospers. Interesting idea though about becoming a
leader due to their success in the free market. Bill Gates for head of the
country anyone? I would change this idea though to have the people vote on
the leader who's the success in the free market because what if one of the
possible leaders is an egotistical maniac or has strong racist feelings?
Not everyone with $$ have brains. Some were just damn lucky. I do like this
approach though. We just need to find some other title other than 'dictator'.

I agree. A few of you aren't very extropian if you're thinking the future
is going to be about overpopulation and scarce resources. History tells us
that with human innovation and ingenuity we can accomplish about anything
we wish to do. We will have more resources in the future, not less. Some of
you doomsayers may dub me as naive but take a look at the hard facts
without the doom 'n gloom slanted perception. This is all about boundless
growth not growth restrained by physical limits. We can work around any
physical limits, it's only a matter of time till we discover the knowledge
& tech to do so as shown thoughout history.

Somehow, this silent assumption of physical love-making has crept into my

Ok, so you're already considering reward centre stimulation, 
something resembling these ancient rat autoelectrostimulation 
experiments. No flabby flesh physics to simulate, agreed. 

But even this version is still obsolete, methinks.

(Btw dreams involve all the body representation systems, just inhibiting 
the actual motorics. I think uploads have to forsake such things 
relatively soon).

At least in the beginning. From then on, this version has to

backtracks, issued by clone history consensus) into something Different.

I think actual implementation will rapidly drift away from raw physics, 
into something more abstract, something with a yet better map to the 
underlying hardware. (Always assuming canonical Dyson computer cluster. 
Things beyond we cannot quite parse (yet)).

Uh, so you want to make sex something casual, something which does not

this is my idea of upload sex. But then this pesky partner selection...

It won't be Lamarck alone, most likely it will be an amalgam of Darwin

AR, not VR. VR is something you can buy even now. Requiring an artifical 
reality closely modeled after the pre-upload physical world is a weakness, 
imo.

I think only one optimal solution for a given conformation of atoms and 
energy flux exists (assuming non-transcendence scenario here, which does 
not look too likely assuming the Silence in the Skies). This solution 
will precipitate pretty soon, even leaving no corpses of the other TYPEs in 
its trail ("Assimilation, the new industry standard" -- Borg Gates).

Yes, but relatively to the rest of the AR, one second lasts centuries. 
Sign off now, and login to something utterly incomprehensible just a few 
fleeting aeons later.

No. This is what I can talk about. Future will be different. Sufficiently

Point of Misinformation: Again I have to say that socialistic does not
mean totalitarian. The Nazis were not socialists. you'll notice that among
the people lumped in the death camps were the communists, who hitler
feared, because of his links to the industrialists.

A state sponsored capitalism is even worse than unrestricted capitalism.
Like we have here, where the government health care system is at the mercy
of pharmaceutical companies price increase. The companies know they can
increase the price of equipment as much as they want and the governemnt
will soak it up. Same thing with the pentagon: guaranteed state market.

I don't want that. Look at socialist democracies. They work fine. There is
no oppression, but there are taxes. It's not the best system, but within a
market economy, it's working fairly well.

I love competition. The thought of netscape and microsoft going head to
head over who develops the best product is great, because nobody is
getting crushed in the process, and I get (depending on who wins) better
software. But with multinationals, and monopolies, this spirit of free 
trade and beneficial competition goes out the window.
 With unrestricted capitalism, I think you'll get monopolies happening
faster than ever, simply because unethical corporations are not punished,
as thus can do whatever they want to get ahead. Then one corporation will
be nastier, make more money, and be able to purchase all the other ones.

That would be great!! But I have a feeling there won't be a next one. I
think you'll get a situation much like the last century, where workers
were ill-treated, and the merchants did whatever they could to further
profits, regardless of the human impact it had.

But everybody should have the same opportunity. I would like everybody to
have the same chances offered to them to be rich as anybody else. If they
refuse it, fine, but they should have the chance. Yes, having scientists
clean toilets exclusively is bad, but rotating the menial jobs about, so
the scientist has to clean a toilet a week, isn't.

Yes, rigid equality is grotesque. I just picture Zamyatin's We. What I
want is equal opportunity. This isn't offered in capitalism because the
capital is held by others, who wouldn't  give it to you because they don't
like you. Your idea may be profitable and great, but if you speak up
against those who finance these things, you'll go down.

I received a message from you that looked like it was intended either
for extropians or most of the subset who are on netcom, but somehow,
all I got was the header.  It didn't even have a subject.  I'm not
sure whether it's my mailer's fault (I use procmail, and occsionally I
get strange results) or something else.  If you sent a message last
night, would you mind re-sending it to me so I can figure out why my
mailer might have mis-handled it?

Thanks,
Chris

Gee and my mother just taught me to be polite, to walk on the outside,
to open doors for women, and not to swear.

[SNiP]
i'm sorry i don't understand what you're trying to say

I say:
What a pity--I thought it was clear enough. 

(2) The kind-acting person who runs the candy store may actually like 
kids, or not--but if the kind-acting person who runs the candy store 
catches a kid stealing, there will be consequences (in my rosy, 
Norman Rockwell tinted view, they will be rather limited and will 
not include death, dismemberment, lawsuit or jail time). 

Contrariwise, the candystore owner-operator had better not cheat his customers. 

This contrasts with the other relationships mentioned:
commerce is not (1) mother-love, and it's not (3) a life-risking 
encounter with a potential exploiter (maybe I should have made (3) 
a pimp at the Port Authority instead of a crack dealer).

How's that for an explanation?

I place "commerce" with, in part, following the rule "don't cheat 
people, it isn't fair."

 I consider it a "least hypothesis." Perhaps you were never taught 
this. It is polite, it has very little to do with walking on the outside, 
opening doors for women, and not swearing, as far as I can tell.

I agree with you that commerce is not all.

What you say above and what you say below can't both be right. I think what  
you say above is correct.

Not so, I presented excellent evidence that I am still alive after I am fast  
uploaded, namely I produced something that has my memories, acts just like me, 
and insists that he is indeed me.  As good as this evidence is, I admit it 
falls short of a proof. You will NEVER be able to prove that my upload, 
fast or slow, has my consciousness, but then, you can't even prove I had 
consciousness before the upload, just as I can NEVER prove you are conscious. 
Nobody worries about being the only conscious being in the universe because in 
our hart every human being on this planet takes it as an axiom of existence 
that when something act's intelligent it is conscious. For the same reason, 
I don't worry about an upload who act's just like me not being me.


                >I believe that the technology for slow gradual uploads will                 
                >develop much sooner than a flash upload capability. 


It seems to me that a destructive upload would probably be easier to do than 
a non destructive one.

I honestly don't know what more I can do. I examine 2 physical systems, I can  
find absolutely no difference in them, I conclude there is no difference. 
Where is the faith? If There is no physical difference, and you say you don't  
believe in superstitious mumbo jumbo, then the question remains, what exactly  
is the difference?

Well, I can admit I'm still a big time esspresso addict (thanks a lot

and their book "Fallen Angels" (as well as great psycholibertarianism
like RAW & Leary), I believe I've developed the space drive that will

Unfortunately, this assumes that ANYONE should be "in power"  Look at
the biggest organisms on the planet- coral reefs, Mangroves, underground
molds, and hyperthermophilic communities in the earth's crust. The HTP
biomass is estimated to exceed 90% of all the living mass on the planet.
None of these has anything like a central authority, yet they are the
most successful organisms.

Here's an analogy, using an idea of a possible alien judgement on the
superior species on the planet: 

The most superior species on the planet must be the cereal grains. They
occupy all the best real estate, are tended to by an autonomous species
which propagates the cereal's seed, and have a whole host of species
which serve one or more of their needs. They absorb the vast majority of
the solar flux, as well as material natural resources.

BTW, they also do not have a central authority.

Actually, if you look at the growth the human brain experiences from
prenatal to teen-age years, it is quite capable of extension.

What do you mean by high level?

Resources will only continue to expand if we continue to grow. The
"sustainable living" movement thinks that we can maintain the existing
level of civilization, population, etc. with minimal harm to the
environment indefinitely. Wrong. If we don't transcend, we will be stuck
in a downward social and evolutionary spiral, as planetary resources
become more and more scarce, more expensive to recover and refine, etc.
Getting OFF this planet and/or onto silicon is paramount to our
continued growth and existence.

So you DO agree with me that married people DO have this trade contract: to
love, honour, etc. This is a form of trade.  Love for love, honour for
honour. etc.

To live I need a somebody (a business) that sells food.  To Love I need a
person who will trade their love with me (buy-sell).  To learn I need someone
to trade their knowledge with me (buy-sell).  To leave a legacy I need

Very good.  This is close to "We are all self employed".  The only difference
is that being self employed means being responsible to yourself AND to your
"customer".  

I think WaaSE is *better* because IARFM-Own-L could mean a win-lose "kill the
other guy" situation.  WaaSE means only Win-Win. Win-lose is undesirable.  I
still like WaaSE: responsibility for BOTH buyer and seller e.g. even trade.  

Giving a gift to someone implies an even trade in exchange, not altruism and
not theft.   Even giving a gift of a kidney the "seller" (giver)  gets a
feeling of worth (saving a person's life) as "payment" from the "buyer".   I
think this is the PROFIT in helping people.  Not true altruism.

universally current and is well propagated.   It is a variant of  the meme
"Self preservation".  

As you have said helping is an old fashioned idea.  Being responsible for
yourself first came long before helping others.  A dead person can can not
help anybody.  Therefore, taking care of yourself _must_ come before helping
anybody else.  Mentally ill people son can not help other mentally ill before
getting themselves cured first.   

Do you really think the meme "self-preservation" came AFTER the meme "help
(be responsible for) others"?  Do you think "be responsible for others"
(selflessness, altruism) is a wider held meme than "self preservation"
 (selfishness)?  

Who cares?  Because, I think "we are all self employed" encompasses _both_
ideas.  The business of self employment needs to survive IN ORDER TO  be
responsible to serve customers (help others).  Self-preservation CAUSES
people being _able_ to help others.  It's up to them then if they choose to
do so.

Trade IS cooperation.  You want something I have and I want something you

Non-cooperation with a small controlling group (government or industry) is

 It is the freedom you have with capitalism.  You are free to choose.

Then why do business with them?  You are free to choose.  
You are confusing ALL of capitalism with the few Win-Lose companies.  

You are blind to the Win-Win business deal --- main reason for repeat
business in capitalist trading (and cooperation of any kind.)  The repeat
business is the ONLY way ANY company can stay in business because a company
has no guns and prisons to punish me if I don't by their product.

I can't understand why a business is so fearful to you.  They don't have
guns, or police, or armies,  or prisons.  They will not come to your house at
3 AM to arrest you for not buying an IBM computer or using MCI instead of
AT&T.  

The government grounds out all competition. How many competing governments do
we have to choose from?  Not many.   People crash through the gates to get
into capitalist countries,  you _never_ see that with communist or
fascist-socialist countries.  

Businesses on the other hand are in competition with dozens of other
companies everyday on a world wide basis.   Are you talking about win-lose
monopolies?  Only then would I partly agree with you. (They still don't have
prisons and police).  

But, even monopolies can't force you to buy unless their product can't be
purchased through other means, the black market, and it has to be a product
extremely important to life.  Healthcare mergers (monopolies, HMOs) are not a
good deal for the patient in my opinion.  Even then smaller companies start
up to compleat for healthcare markets.  A friend of mine started one up last
month because the "big boys" got too expensive.

This is but one option, IMHO, and I assume you mean

First we must create AI. SI. Whatever else needed.
Or we must find some transportaion to get off

Here is a quick little thought experiment for everyone on this
uploading/consciousness thread:

Assume uploading actually moved your currently operating stream of
consciousness to a computer.
Suppose the upload apparatus was connected to a multiplexing device so that
the upload data could be sent on two separate channels at the same time.
Now suppose you have two different computers connected up to the two
different channels.  Both computers reconstruct your stream of consciousness
as though each was the only computer connected to the upload apparatus.

If the apparatus is actually uploading *your* stream of consciousness, is it
possible for it to exist in two places at the same time?

Isn't having a single stream of consciousness and having two simultaneous
instances of a single stream mutually exclusive?

Which instance is really *your* stream of consciousness?

Yes, there have been many Star Trek episodes that suggest regret towards
scientific progress, loss of innocence, and other such nonsense.

My favorite character was always Mr. Spock.  The only thing I didn't like
about him was his "human" side.  McCoy -- with his incessant ridiculing of
logic -- was annoying.

The Voyager series is particularly obnoxious with its characters who
worship their primitive ancestors, it's ever-present cultural diversity,
and routine depiction of aliens as humans with birth defects.  I will be
very disappointed if political correctness is still in vogue four hundred
(?) years from now.

This is the point I tried to make earlier.  Uploaded minds could easily

Hopefully, uploads will experience some desires -- the desire for

I don't see how this follows.  For example, genetic engineering is already
enabling us to do some of the gene manipulations that previously could only
be accomplished through natural reproduction.  Resources may never become
unlimited, but they will surely become increasingly abundant.

Everybody already has the opportunity.  Admittedly, not everyone has the
*same* opportunity as everyone else, but it is about time that you accept
that LIFE IS NOT FAIR.  No amount of anything will ever make life fair for
everyone.  Cream always has a way of rising to the top.  To say otherwise is
to say that all people are absolutely identical.

Why should scientists clean toilets?  They weren't born scientists.  They
got there via a long and arduous path where they may have cleaned many
toilets along the way.  Not having to clean toilets is their reward for all
the work and suffering the endured in getting to be a scientist.

If your idea is really that great and profitable, you will find capitalist
who will support it.  If not, then maybe the "greatness" and "profitability"
is in your own mind.  

Having capital does not equate to equal opportunity.  Many great businesses
have started using a technique called "bootstrapping" which has very little
capital requirements.  Sure, you have to work a little harder for your money
initially, but in the long run, you are better off because you are in full
control.  Getting capital from capitalists puts part of your idea and
business under someone else's control.  It is not a case of something for
nothing.

As I said above, opportunity exists for anyone will to put forth the effort
to take advantage of it.  My own life is a case in point.  I moved to the
Silicon Valley five years ago with $7 dollars to my name and a high school
diploma.  I am now college educated, run my own business, and am extremely
successful financially.  I got there because I work 70-80 hours a week and
am goal oriented.  I strongly believe that anyone who really wants to
succeed can if they are willing to work hard enough.  

Having capital is useless if you don't have the ambition to take advantage
of it.  And if you have enough ambition and will, free capital is
unnecessary.  I know many successful entrepreneurs and the common factor
among them is they work very hard and they make things happen instead of
waiting for things to happen to them.  Very rarely do people succeed simply
because they have capital.

I don't think the argument is whether or not what is uploaded is equivalent
to you.  The argument is whether what is uploaded is the *same* as you.
Equivalence and sameness are very different, especially when factors such as
self-awareness come into play.  Although a self-aware program cannot tell
the difference between equivalent instances of its own program, it can tell
the difference between itself and other instances.  

There is a parallel to this in the computer world.  Consider what happens if
you start two copies of Microsoft Word on your computer.  You have two
identical programs both running in the memory of your computer, quite
possibly in exactly the same state.  Question: how does your operating
system tell the difference between two copies of identical software in
exactly the same state?
The answer is that every instance of Microsoft Word has an externally
identifiable signature that only has significance to the operating system
and other programs.  When the Word program is running, it operates only in
its own context. It does not require knowledge of the signature to run
perfectly.

Note that the signature is based on spatial and physical properties of each
instance of Microsoft Word, since there is no other possible way of
distinguishing identical programs.  In the case of computers, this would be
a RAM address.  You could start and stop each instance of Word as many times
as you like and the signature, hence identity, would remain the same.

The signature is essentially the "self-awareness" of the program.  A program
is deleted by changing or erasing this signature.  Suppose now that you copy
one of the running copies to a whole new block of memory and continue
execution exactly at the point it was at before you copied it.  This would
automatically generate a new signature by definition.  In the context of the
running program, nothing would have changed.  From an external context
however, it would be an entirely different instance of the program that was
just running before it moved.

The point to all this is that even though your consciousness "felt" the same
after upload internally, external observers would only recognize an
equivalence, not a sameness.

By "high level" I mean replacing macro-scale brain structures with hardware
based on a foreign computational architectures.

Actually, the difficulty isn't so much in the hardware as it is in the
interfacing software.  On a micro scale this is fairly easy since you are
only looking at discrete signals.  On a macro scale, however, you also have
to consider the relationships between signals on the order of millions or
billions of simultaneous signals.  This has to be done both going in to the
hardware and going back in to the brain.  The computational complexity of
decoding this type of interface would require immense quantities of
computational power.  

You could use neural network based enhancement hardware to minimize the
interfacing problem, but neural networks are not efficient computational
architectures for many classes of problems.  In the long run, it would break
down to how much you are willing to spend for computational enhancement.
The cost/performance ratio could get prohibitively large very fast, based
almost exclusively on the complexity of installation and integration.

Of course not. But this is an operational question posed from *outside* the
skin of the two would-be uploaders.  An important issue unresolved by this
`Turing test' question remains, as I posed it earlier: would one be prepared
to die (sacrific one's current instantiation) in order that an exact copy of
oneself be reconstituted elsewhere, or on a different substrate?  To insist
upon this question is not to be a hostile `upload skeptic', at least not in
the sense that the philosopher John Searle might be, denying that a
consciousness could ever be instantiated on a computer system.  

Greg Egan's fiction, which I keep blathering admiringly about, plays with
these questions in a series of skin-crawling gedanken experiments.  His
favoured mode of upload/duplication/extended non-carbon life is a growing
`crystal' that is implanted in the brain, and echoes (in effective, mirrors
or redundantly and passively stores) every brain state from then on: `learns
to be me'.  It's a bit like the two cerebral hemispheres, to the extent
(whatever that extent is) that those are not complementary but redundant
backups.  Eventually, when your consciousness is running on a joint system,
neural net perfectly echoed by the crystal, your meaty brain is scooped out.
This, to the unprejudiced, is no cause for alarm.  Had the mirroring been
done at a distance, onto a human-capable machine via radio, the same
situation would obtain.  

Well, what if all twins were perfectly telepathic... but that doesn't quite
work, because they are differently situated *as visible actors* in space,
and the loss of one body would surely devastate the other locus of their
shared consciousness.  

What if everyone were *given* a cloned double, with whose brain-states he or
she became redundantly resonant...  No, it's hard to retain empathy for the
subjects of these thought games.  Vinge's 101 dalmations in space, in A FIRE
UPON THE DEEP, goes some way toward exploring the experience of a
disseminated consciousness some of whose modules die and get replaced by
variant plug-ins (ie different doggies entirely).

Bottom line: physical continuity and general brain-process continuity
jointly create our sense of continuing identity and allow us to believe that
the person who wakes up tomorrow is the same one who went to sleep tonight
(or in 10 years after a coma, but nobody denies that this case is deeply
traumatic; or after half the brain is removed due to cancer, and no one
denies that this case is even more deeply troubling).  Even if *I* can't
tell the difference between you and your perfect clone, *you* surely can, as
they strip you down.  Check out Algis Budrys's classic 1960 sf novel about
matter transmission, ROGUE MOON, where there's a copy at each end, or James
Kelly's much discussed recent story `Think Like a Dinosaur' (I believe it's
called) where aliens with matter transmission tech impose a requirement that
the person left behind must be killed when the double is materialised at the
far end.  I'd go kicking and screaming... not at all reconciled by the
simultaneous existence of my double in the receiving pod - *unless* I
remained, throughout, in perfect non-local continuous connection/identity
with him.  In that case, I'd swiftly get used to the notion that it was just
like dropping off to sleep on the jet and waking up in another town.  Of
course, I could be *fooled* into believing that this were the case, even if
a destructive-uploading expert knew it wasn't, which would soothe my dread.
`Just step into the nice warm shower, Damien...'  But I'd rather not be
deceived in that way.

But the key word is COPY.  COPY COPY COPY COPY. as opposed to ORIGINAL.
I think what you are trying to say is that a copy is as good as the real
thing, bit it isnt in the view of the original, as the original is STILL
stuck in the body, if it is a nondestructive flash copy job, or dead if
it is a destructive copy.

A flash upload will basically need to scan our entire brains down to the
quantum level in an instant, while a slow upload would consist of slowly
adding more and more capacity and augmentation to the existing brain,
until the mind has grown to the point where it would not notice if that
old slow bioware suddenly developed some bad sectors (Alzheimers) and
got corrupted and erased (dead). Many individuals and companies are
working on the technologies now to accomplish this in various ways,
while the flash upload is more of a science fantasy concept that belongs
with Star Trek teleporters.

I just described the big difference between the two. The leap of faith
is trusting that even though your brain is gonna get fried in the
process, the copy of you is still YOU and not a copy that thinks its
you. There IS a difference. Frankly I couln't care if it was you or a
copy of you, but I'm sure that the original you would be quite perturbed
to get halfway through having his brain fried to figure out its not such
a good idea.

Michael Lorrey said, "I have NEVER been to a government run facility where I 
was communicated with in a freindly manner, or treated in any way like I was a 
human being. Unfortunately, I cannot take my government business elsewhere, as 
they currently enforce their monopoly quite strictly (i.e. Waco, Ruby RIdge, 
Justus Township), so they are not motivated to act any differently"

I haven't noticed this phenomenon directly, but my mother once got a job 
working for our city's utilities company (the city generated its own power), 
and the other employees told her, "You don't have to be nice to people; they 
have to come here."  She was horrified by this attitude and by many other 
serious problems with the government workers who didn't really care about 
anyone and acted very rude and childish, so she quit the job after a few 
weeks.  

It just goes to show that the government really DOESN'T CARE about people.  
Why should they?  The workers pretty much keep their jobs no matter how poorly 
they perform or how rude they are to customers.  Their supervisors don't have 
anything to lose if the people they are in charge of perform badly.  Their pay 
won't be cut; they won't lose their job, it's just more work for them to try 
to change the behavior of those they are in charge of, work that they won't be 
rewarded for.  Some people have the discipline to do good work anyway, so 
there are exceptions, but there is no monetary motivation to excell, like 
there is in commerce.

I passed this thought along to Greg Egan, who commented as follows (I quote
with his permission):

-------------------------------------------------------
I thought about the "quantity of dust" issue a bit more after I finished
the book, and I can't see how (if the "dust theory" is true at
all) you could tell the difference between a universe ultimately made of
just two distinguishable "pieces of dust" called "1" and "0", which are
"recycled" (i.e. perceived to be arranged in patterns like 1001001110, when
there's really only one of each "in existence") ... and a universe with a
certain larger but finite quantity of "1"s and "0"s.  To be finite or not
is a property of the way you *use* the dust -- of the upper-level laws of
physics.  So our universe could be a closed, finite universe, and the
Permutation City universe could grow forever ... and *both* could simply be
different rearrangements of the same two pieces of dust.

I suppose that's really just Platonic materialism -- but I don't think
there's a choice between that, and a finite supply of dust you can run out of
(against your own laws of physics).  I think the dust theory implies
arbitrary freedom to recycle, so the notion of "quantity of dust" is
meaningless, so for economy's sake we should say there's just a single "0"
and a single "1".

The meme: WaaSE is dated back to the old Testament: "God helps those who
help themselves".

Is currently popularized under the motto: TANSTAAFL, which stands for:
"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch." and is known in science and
engineering as the Laws of Thermodynamics.

I personally believe that  space migration is the fundamentally
important one, even if just to get our eggs out of one basket. Living in
a gravity well anywhere is a dumb idea. It's like living in a one

I would assume that during the upload process, to keep the stream of
conciousness "connected" the mind would have to be cognizant, and would
sense, in the case of one computer and one human, a sense of being in
two places at once, and in the case of two computers being uploaded,
three places. THe tough thing is running one mind off of multiple copies
of the same file. I would expect some call conflicts to crop up. Once
the upload is complete, the bio hardware would be basically blank, or
remain connected to one of the new minds. Being connected to both I
would expect to create a multiple personality type conflict. Perhaps the
two new minds would have joint custody of the human interface tool? 

Mike v 2.0.A: "I get the old Mike on Mon, Wed, and Fri, while you get
him for Tues, Wed, and Sat, and we'll trade off on Sundays"

Mike v 2.0.B: " No fair you'll have him for both Monday Night Football
and the X-Files...."

Mike A: "OK I'll take Thursday and you can have Friday."

Mike B: "But that means you'll get our night with Betty, and she's not
doubled yet...."

Mike A: "Ok we trade off Thursday instead of Sunday, but I get the weeks
we stay over at her house..."

Once the upload is finished, the two minds would be separate people.

Both. This is budding, and we are each the same Mike as before, but not
the same as each other, as we each start having different experiences,
that make us different people.

I think you may be premature on that one. I certainly see plenty of 
evidence to the contrary--mothers groom their kids everywhere I look,
and the kids reciprocate.

Further, it has been argued that a certain amount of social conversation 
serves as a substitute for grooming. If true, have we really transcended?

The wonderful thing about transcendence, in my view, is that one can 
choose what qualities one wants to retain, or even enhance. I think 
Max said something of the kind recently.

Yes, scanning every last connection and impulse is not neccessary. Using
algorithms describing the neural behavior to build identical system that
operates at various speeds (accelerate as the user gets used to the new
hardware) and can be hooked up to the brain would I believe be all that
is needed, plus time. Given a hookup to unused capacity, it is the
natural tendency to occupy the space. There are very few parts of the
human brain that cannot be damaged and rerouted around, and those tend
to be the visual and spinal areas, areas which will be the first to be
augmented. Once the human has shifted enough of their capacity to new
hardware, cutting the cord would have no discernable effects. Given new
capacity, the mind will grow as a natural consequence.

Yes some types of computation are difficult with neural systems,
however, with the new hardware, it will be much easier for the
individual to engage in rapid interface with auzilliary systems that can
do the work. Like having a calculator hooked up to your mind, rather
than having to punch out all the buttons...

Absolutely! But taking our own scarcity along won't get us far.
We certainly need a lot of diverse, life sustaining  technology. And all the
rest of the bag of tricks we can muster to keep us alive on an offworld
colony. I dont think it's going to be like in Star Trek where all the planets
have air we can breathe and humanoids who speak English 100% ; - ) 
This is all I meant by directing the attention to what we can do here and
now. Of course we want options, lots of options...

        These questions have come up multiple times on the list; I thought I
had answered them, but obviously not well enough.  Michael Lorrey did a good
job of explaning, but I'll still try to point out *my* thoughts.  Here goes
(in the shortest, most precise words I can find):

        Yes, it is possible for *your* consciousness to exist in two places
at one time.  Each independent consciousness that acknowledges itself as
*yours* will carry on as if it is *you*.  However, each consciousness that
acknowledges itself as *yours* will have different experiences, ultimately
leading to a renewed stream of consciousness.  As Michael said, it is
potentially a 'budding' system where all consciousnesses are created as
identical replicas of *you* but stray away to become different *yous* based
on their individual experiences.  Okay, so the words weren't so short or
precise...but it's the *thought* that counts --pun intended! :-)

This delay is not a minor engineering consideration, it is built into the 
very fabric of the universe. If information could not work in a physical  
context it would be a useless concept. Information is not a useless concept.

I've never heard of the "Information can not be moved only copied" Theorem 
and I am not totally ignorant in such matters, but if it really exists please  
tell me exactly what it means. Why it is concrete and practical if as you say 
it has nothing to do with "the physical context"? How would our physical 
Universe be the slightest bit different if it were untrue?

I not sure I know what you mean by "synchronized", but it is true that Godel   
proved in 1930 that any mathematical system with a finite number of axioms 
will be inconsistent or incomplete, some things are just undecideable. For a 
few years after Godel made his discovery it was hoped that we could at least  
identify those undecideable things, that is, statements that were either 
false or true but had no proof. If we could do that then we would know we 
were  wasting our time looking for a proof and we could move on to other 
things, but in 1935 Turing proved that sometimes even that was impossible.

Exactly, and in a fast upload my consciousness wouldn't even be interrupted, 
I wouldn't even know anything unusual was happening.

I'm delighted you uses the term "mechanism", a mechanism works by physical

we can duplicate a mechanism.

Huh?? This mechanism finds a difference between 2 blocks of information that

What does it even mean?

If the 2 atoms look and act exactly the same then you could exchange them and 
it would make no difference. Atoms have no individuality, if they can't even  
give themselves this property how can they give it to us?

Just replace components in steps until you get the architecture you want.

True enough. But why are there SO MANY damn doomsayers??!?! It's probably
due to the fact that in the 'great meme of the world' christianity, tells
the story that things get progressively worse in the future and that they
will need to be prepared for the second coming when God will annihilate the
universe and start over. I guess this
is partially correct if our universe has a godless big crunch sometime in
the future and we're unable to stop it.

I am REALLY looking forward to the upcoming probe missions to Mars stirred
up by the possibility that microbial life may still exist in isolated
places on Mars. Did you see this month's Scientific American? It has
incredible computer-generated photos of how Mars would've looked like in
it's warm oceanic youth. Wednesday er, tomorrow the first of the probes
will launch carrying 80% of the science carried aboard the failed Mars
Observer. I wonder if Eric Paulos from Berkeley have thought of using their
'web blimps' as rovers on Mars to explore the terrain? I have seen no
meantion of this on their website. Check out their concept of telepresence
at http://vive.cs.berkeley.edu/blimp/

I can quite agree. I worked for the City of Redondo Beach in the
Information Systems Division when I was 15. Not only is the public treated
inhumanly but at my city, employees weren't treated humanly either and
there was a strict militaristic feeling to the whole bit. Not positive at
all. It was actually a relief when they layed me off due to my inability to
juggle high school and a job because I was only able to work for 3 hrs a
day. The stress was unbearable for someone that age and they wanted the
whole thing run with zero failure or they'd call me up to the carpet and
get lectured. This has unfortunetly poisened my idea of what jobs are like
and I haven't been employed since then (I'm only 18) and it makes me
apprehensive about getting a job soon. Most jobs treat you like a person
don't they?

Uhh! Upload Holocaust! Scary. I wonder how the teleport tech works in Star
Trek. Nano, accelerated particles, or upload clones? Remember the episode
where they teleport Riker off a ship and the teleporter malfunctions and
they have a clone that remained on that ship for like 20 years? Or the
episode where that guy was afraid to go into the teleporters because he was
afraid his consciousness would cease to exist? Perhaps we're seeing a
million clones of Riker, and Picard!

You almost had it right, it's actually "http://www.leonardo.net/eztv/"
gotta watch out for those case-sensitive net addresses. Also I've noticed a
problem that everytime I see a punch of repeating patterns right next to
each other my eyes refocus and look at it as though it's a stereogram. I
used to look at stereograms when they were first toying with the concept by
making pink-static golf balls. I can look at any stereogram and instantly
see the picture but this reflex i've created from looking at *alot* of
stereograms causes me to involuntarily refocus my eyes whenever i look at a
repeating pattern. Strange. Anyone else heard of someone doing this?

A few months ago I wrote 3 messages to the list about a little adventure I 
had. As the question of personal identity and copies has come up again and 
there are a lot of new members I thought I'd repeat it.

===========================================================================
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 


I need some advice and it's not the sort of thing I can write to
Ann Landers. About a year ago I started building a matter
duplicating machine. It could find the position and velocity of
every atom in a human being to the limit imposed by Heisenberg's law. 
It then used this information to construct a copy and it does it all 
in a fraction of a second and without harming the  original  in any way. 
You may be surprised that I was able to build such a  complicated machine, 
but you wouldn't be if you knew how good I am with my hands. The birdhouse 
I made is simply lovely and I have all the latest tools from Sears.

I was a little nervous but I decided to test the machine by
duplicating myself. The day before yesterday I walked into the
chamber, it filled with smoke (damn those radio shack transformers) 
there was a flash of light, and then 3 feet to my left 
was a man who looked exactly like me. It  was at that
instant that the full realization of the terrible thing I did
hit me. I yelled " This is monstrous, there can only be one of me",  
my copy yelled exactly the same thing. I thought he was
trying to mock me, so I reached for my 44 magnum that I always
carry with me (I wonder why people think I'm strange) and
pointed it at my double. I noted with alarm that the double also
had a gun and he was pointed it at me. I shouted "you don't have
the guts to pull the trigger, but I do". Again he mimicked my
words and did so in perfect synchronization, this made me even
more angry and I pulled the trigger, he did too. My gun went off
but his gun jammed. I buried him in my back yard.

Now that my anger has cooled and I can think more clearly I've
had  some pangs of conscious about killing a living creature,
but that's not what really torments me. How do I know I'm  not
the copy? I feel exactly  the same as before, but would a copy
feel different? Actually there is a  way to be certain, I have a
video tape of the entire experiment. My memory is  that the copy
first appeared 3 feet to my LEFT, if the tape shows the original
walking into the chamber and the copy materializing 3 feet to
his RIGHT, then I would know that I am the copy. 

I'm afraid to look at the tape, should I  be? If I found out I
was the copy  what should I do? I suppose I should morn the
death of John Clark, but how  can I, I'm not dead. If I am the
copy would that mean that I have no real  past and my life is
meaningless? Is it important, or should I just burn the  tape
and forget all about it?

==========================================================================

Feb 14 1996


A few  days after I posted the above the shit really hit the fan. My PPA 
the Acme Protection Agency found out about it, and  I'd love to know which
one of you guys squealed to them. Anyway, they were hounding me
constantly, following me around and asking all sorts of
embarrassing questions. I tried to explain to them that nobody
really died because no consciousness was stopped or even
interrupted, but they weren't impressed with my arguments. All 
they were interested in was that there was a dead body and it
had John Clark's  DNA and John Clark was one of their clients. I
picked Acme originally because they were a honest, tough no nonsense 
organization,  but now I wished I had picked a PPA that had 
a more philosophical bent. The fact that Acme also has capital punishment 
didn't seem as appealing as it once did either. 
        
I knew that if I was going to do something I had to do it quickly. 
My lawyer told me I should expect to be arrested in the
next few days. He said that my best bet was to plead self defense,
but he didn't seem very optimistic, and  even if I eventually
won it would take years and every dime I had in legal  bills. 
I had a better idea, it would solve things in one day and it would
only cost half my money, but I would have to do something I'd
been dreading  first. I looked at the video tape,  my worst
fears were confirmed, I am the  copy, no doubt about it. This
sort of threw me for a loop at first, but I  gradually got used
to the idea, and now realized that I feel just the same so it
can't possibly make any difference.

I set up my video camera so it covered the entrance to the
duplicating  chamber but was careful to make sure that this time
it couldn't see into the chamber itself. I turned on my
duplicating machine and walked into the  chamber, a few seconds
later I walked out but there was somebody with me, somebody who
looked just like me. I sent the tape to Acme and they dropped
all charges against me. They had no choice, Acme may be tough
but no PPA will  prosecute someone if they know there is a 50%
probability they are innocent. They have no way of knowing
which one of us killed the original John Clark,  even we don't know. 

Well, this solved one problem but it created another one, the copy. 
I've tried  to be broad minded about it, really I have,
but the man is just obnoxious.  Mr. Know-it-all is always
droning on and on about the stupidest things, and he thinks he's
SO smart, personally I think he's a moron. Just as I feared he 
says he deserves half of my money, but I'm the one who made it
not him, I remember how I earned every dollar. I don't like the
way he looks at my girlfriend either.

This entire experience has made me a wiser man. I now understand
the value of subtlety, putting a bullet in the brain of the
original John Clark was stupid. I also understand that the world 
is a dangerous place and that dreadful accidents happen every day. 
How very sad. 

I'm looking at the jerk right now  and he has an insufferable grin 
on his face. I don't know why he's looking so smug but that's OK, 
let him grin while he can, it won't last long. I know exactly how to 
deal with him, and to think, people used to say that I understood machines 
but not people. I'll soon prove them wrong.

It looks like he's also writing a post but I can't quite make
out from here what he's saying, probably just a bunch of
pretentious nonsense, I'll read it when I come back, right now
I've got to drive into town to get some supplies. I'll be
mighty happy when summer comes, I do so hate driving on these icy
mountain roads.


===========================================================================
Feb 18 1996

I had decided that the only way to get Acme Protection Agency off my back was 
to make a duplicate of myself, that way they couldn't tell which one killed 
the original John Clark  so they couldn't prosecute either one of us. 
I walked  into the chamber expecting to see my double materialize next to me, 
but nothing happened. Terrified that the machine was malfunctioning I ran to
the control panel, one of these days I've got to figure out a way to build a 
matter duplicating machine without using 89 pounds of enriched plutonium. 
To my surprise I could not find anything wrong with the machine, then I 
noticed  I wasn't alone. A large tough looking man was staring at me. 

"What the hell! How did you get in here?" I yelled at him. 

"Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to offend,ah, are you John Clark" He stammered.

For a tough looking guy he was sure acting like a wimp. I never could  
intimidate big gorillas like this guy, but I guess those assertiveness 
training  tapes I bought on the home shopping network were paying off after 
all.

"Yea I'm Clark and who the fuck are you"  I said in the tough man voice the 
tapes had taught me. 

Then I  noticed it was dark outside, 5 minutes before when I walked into the 
chamber it was about noon. 

" What's going on?" I said, not sounding quite so tough.

" Oh I'm sorry, my name is Spade, Sam Spade, I'm a private investigator, 
I work for Acme, but don't worry I'm not here to arrest you or anything. 
Ten and a half days have passed since you walked into that chamber, and 
there is nothing wrong with your machine, it's sort of hard to explain but 
the fact is, I used the machine's maintenance logs to reconstruct you  
5 minutes ago, just as you were the last time you used the machine, 
10 and a half days ago."

For some, finding out they were a copy of a copy would be big news, but for 
me it was getting to be old hat. What was amazing was that some gum shoe had 
done it, and from the maintenance log. The information on the state of the 
machine and thus on every object I ever duplicated is in those computer logs, 
but the format of the logs would make it difficult to extract because that's 
not what they were made for. I never used them for anything except 
troubleshooting  the machine.

"My congratulations Mr. Spade" I said " it's not every private eye that has a  
good enough working knowledge of Schrodinger's Wave Equation, quantum 
coherence and non linear error correcting codes to read those logs correctly".

"Yeah well... I got an A in shop class when I was a kid" He said with a touch 
of pride.

"Really! I did too." I said " But what's been going on for the last 10 days?" 

Spade said "The copy of John Clark did duplicate himself, but apparently the  
two versions didn't get along". 

" I've been told I'm a hard man to live with" I said a little sheepishly.

"Both Clarks are dead, and they died at almost exactly the same time, 
it  could be accidental, but the deaths are a little suspicious, especially 
when you consider two almost identical posts made to the to the internet by 
them that are somewhat incriminating. One Clark was found in his car at the 
bottom of a thousand foot cliff. The roads were icy, but the brake lines 
didn't look quite right to me. The other Clark was found crushed under a 
Coke machine. The consensus is that  he put in his 50 cents and when it 
didn't give him his Coke he started beating on it until the machine tipped 
over on him and fractured his skull. Well maybe, but that machine was heavy, 
I tried, I could tip it over and I'm bigger than he was. I think they killed 
each other, they were similar enough to want to kill each other but diverged 
enough in 10 days to chose different methods".

" Now you can't blame that on me" I said indignity, " I know nothing about it, 
I didn't even exist then, well not exactly..."

"Nobody's blaming you" Spade said soothingly " and you are still one of our 
clients, so when I mentioned the maintenance logs in my report my boss said 
we were legally bound to make a good faith effort to revive you, so he told 
me to give it a try and do my best."

He brought out a document from his coat " I am also authorized to offer you 
this deal, Acme agrees not to prosecute you in any manner for this incident  
and to seal the case file, there are those who might find it, ah, titillating. 
In return, you absolve Acme of any liability in this matter and agree to 
resign from The Acme Protection agency within 5 working days. The unused 
portion of your premium will of course be refunded."

Now you can't beat that deal with a stick, I signed the paper before they 
could change their mind. 

I said " I want to thank you Mr. Spade for bringing me back. Can I offer you 
a drink?"

He was already heading for his car at a trot "Thanks but no" He said " I've 
got this, this important thing I've got to do, It's ah, a thing of importance, 
I've got to, ah, wash the lawn, I mean mow  the dog, I mean... good-bye".  

I'm afraid our Mr.Spade is a bit of an oddball , I seem to run across more 
and more people like him lately.
    
As I stood there amid the smell of burning rubber a disturbing thought 
occurred to me, it was a pretty tricky job to get all the information about 
me just from the maintenance logs, was I really  OK, had Spade gotten 
everything right? I've always been good at mental arithmetic so I gave myself 
a test, 5 and 5 is 10, 19 minus 6 is 12, 8 times 9 is 73. Right on the money! 
That was reassuring. 

I must be John Clark, I have all of his memories, I remembered a happy day in 
my childhood when I joined the Vladimer Lenin fan club and received an 
autographed  8 by 10 glossy of the master that has hung in a place of honor 
in my bedroom until it disappeared that very day. Spade must of stolen it.  
I remembered my triumphant election as the head of SHIT (Stop Heretical 
Independent Thoughts) and how I had always hated the Extropian and Transhuman 
philosophy. The memory of the time I played Twister in The Kremlin with 
Marilyn Monroe, J Edgar Hoover and The Dalai Lama while the Pope serenaded us 
with a lovely rendition  of Louie Louie, are as sharp in my mind as the day 
it happened.

Clearly there was nothing wrong with my mind, but what about my body? 
I looked at myself in a mirror and I don't want to brag or anything but 
I looked great! My skin was a nice healthy blue, the scales on the tail were 
strong and sharper than ever. I smiled, what women wouldn't fall for that 
infectious grin and the handsome green slime that oozed out between my fangs 
and fell artistically to the floor.

Okay. Government regulation is "trying" to keep the businesses from
hurting the public. I think things like environmental regulations and
health safety standards try, at least, to help the consumer. If there
weren't any such regulations, companies could easily get away with doing
dumping and selling hazardous products. Which they would. Companies are
adept enough at manipulating media that they can paint a benevolent image
of themselves with one hand and hurt people with the other. Nestle, for
example.


Businesses are subsidized more than taxed. During Reagan's "regime", they
had a large tax cut for businesses, but the poor were still worse off than
before.

I can't thik of a single socialist government in Africa, especially not
Nigeria. Nigeria is a fine capitalism, regardless of the military regime.

You cannot decentralize the government aspect of things without giving
free reign to the business side of things. If you're going to have a free
market, you're going to need a government to keep the private interests in
check. Unless you reduce both drastically, they are both neccessary.
Giving one preference is invitation to totalitarianism. Power is
centralized both on the market side and on the government side. GIving one
control over the other doesn't help much.

That's an excellent blanket statement, but not much logic behind it. I

They left the economy alone, which I think means laissez-faire in the
traditional sense. In fact, most of these geographic areas that are
considered "good investing", have a history of human rights violations.
A bank teller tried to convince me to put my money in Latin America or
South East Asia, two areas that haven't had the best track records for
freedom.

If you're going to have capitalism, you're going to have government. I
still say we drop both of them.

Use a free *nix, e.g. Linux. Last I heard there were no known viruses 
under Linux. Can't do much damage anyway, unless you run untested 
binaries as wheel. 

Another reason to choose free software... Apart from being free, that is.

Uh, I don't think we can ignore physics. We certainly haven't got the 
whole picture, and we can certainly expect further knowledge breakthroughs.
But we must play to the rules of the game, even if we do not know all the 
rules yet.

If the two programs are in exactly the same state, then you are not running  
two programs you are only running one program, you are just doing it in an  
inefficient manner that will cut its speed in half. You are telling the  
machine to make exactly the same calculation twice, but if you already know  
the answer then it's pointless to calculate the same thing again.

You're theory is that the space-time coordinates of a brain are important in  
differentiating one consciousness from another, but I don't see how that  
could be true. You argue that two identical brains somehow produce different  
subjectivity because the brains are in different positions, but a brain 
without senses can't detect it's position. A brain can't detect time either,   
I could speed up or slow down your brain as much as I wanted, I could even  
stop it for a billion years and you would  never notice. A brain without   
senses can't detect anything. 

Sensations can certainly change subjectivity, so the space-time position of  
the sense input is of paramount importance, but the position of the 
information  processing machine is irrelevant. For most of human history 
people thought that the hart was the seat of consciousness and the brain just 
a minor organ to cool the blood, it didn't matter, those people were still 
conscious. The same is true for an Upload, he might not know or care where
his brain was, it could be distributed in thousands of computers all over the 
planet. On the other hand, he would be very interested where and when his 
senses were.

                >the same.
                

Then the two programs would no longer be identical.
                

                >A program is deleted by changing or erasing this signature.  
                

And if I deleted my letter on one Word program but not the other, then my 
letter survives.

Well which is it? Before you said things would look the same to an external 
observer but not subjectively, now you say the opposite. If you felt like you   
survived after the upload, what more do you need?

I could be wrong but I think you would agree with me that the mind is what  
the brain does. Playing music is what a phonograph does. If 2 phonographs are  
synchronized and playing the same symphony and you destroy one machine,  
the music does not stop. And it's real music not simulated music, just as a 
computer performs real arithmetic not simulated arithmetic.

No, but then it's not even possible for consciousness to exist in one place 
at the same time because consciousness does not have a place because it is 
not a noun, it is an adjective.

That's the beauty of a really FREE market - It automatically weeds 
out the badies.  A person with strong racist feelings would simply not 
_be_ one of the richest people in the world, because the majority of 
people don't support this idea.  

> Not everyone with $$ have brains.

Everyone with $$ has the right combination of brains, courage and 
pragmatism, otherwise they wouldn't have that much money.

I don't support the idea of having a free market on the one hand and 
politics on the other, where the winner in the money game gets to be 
the winner in the politics game.  It makes more sense to me to only 
have the free market as law maker.

Well, you may be right, the way things are going.
I had a talk with my cereal this morning...
The cereal community is really concerened because
it is losing it's rich, diverse texture.. Too many cross breedings of cereals
and grains, combined with the
grinding and blending of different cereals together 
are causing the cereals to lose their individual
identities. Their flavor, so to speak.

A new government program is being discussed which
protects the rights of various grains. As cross cereal
issues become more complex, I am sure we will have regulations which ensure
that all cereals are equal.

True, but we as a race can survive with only the first. If the others

I'd still like to see more people get intelligence amplification enough

There are so many doomsayers because there are so many people who are
antitechnology, thanks to our fine liberal tradition, so even if they
are smart enough to forsee the Malthusian conflicts ahead, they are too
anti tech to see that technology is the only solution.

Of course your money is with humans, you are one. But if it's just who
survives, then my bet is with the hypertheormophilic bacteria. Using
Mars as an example, the latest word is that a Martian meteroite tested
by British scientists which is only 600,000 years old has the same life
traces as the 15 million year old rock publicized earlier. This second
rock is from a period of maritan history when the environment was pretty
much the same as it is right now, leading to the high possibility that
there are still such organisms in volvanic vents and under the crust of
Mars.

SO if simple survival proves superiority, the HTP bugs will be here long
after we are gone.

Actually, if you do some web surfing, use AltaVista to look up
"Extrasolar;Planets" and you will learn about all the planets we are
discovering. It turns out that planets seem to be a natural phenomenon
of just about every sun-like star, though less likely with binary
systems. From this, it seems pretty likely that inhabitable, oxygen
atmophere, water ocean worlds will be pretty common.

Also, the dominant form of biological life will be based on carbon, like
we are. THe next best element as a replacement is silicon, has less than
50% of the versatility chemically as carbon, so is less likely to be
used. However, DNA may not neccessarily be the form of building bioware.
A star with a bit too much ultraviolet light output would simply
scramble DNA too much to be of use, unless you had an environment like
Seven Day Planet where massive reproduction, high metabolic rates, and
high rates of evolution would be the norm.

Additionally, though I can't promise English speaking, for obvious
reasons (though with augmentation, maybe even a fish in the ear ;),
universal translators "may" be possible), i read a recent study of
likely forms of intelligent aliens. According to the analysis of
evolutionary behavior, the humanoid form is the most likely to be
intelligent, though not necessarily mammalian or even human features,
but the bipedal, two eyes and ears, two to four arms, and four to six
fingered hand, who is omnivorous. Of course,this is based on an expected
limited database of how much we think we know about our world, and how
little we know about others.

And government is the master at media manipulation. THey don't promise
they'll clean it up, they just want to LOOK like they are advocating
regulation that have the apparent purpose of makeing someone else clean
things up, when the reason things were dumped before was because
government gave them tax breaks to invest in certain industries, then
refused to build the waste disposal facilities that the businesses
needed to get rid of the waste. Sotring it was an OSHA health hazard, so
they had to get rid of it somewhere. Where they put is was not the
governments responsibility, so long as they didn't dump any where IN MY
BACKYARD.

Excuse me, but income taxes have gone down, and anyone in the US who
makes less than 20,000 dollars a year pays no net taxes at all, on
average. Business taxes have gone up, especially on small businesses,
typically owned by a husband and wife, employing less than 50 people.
Big monopolistic, non-laissez faire corporations get all the tax breaks.

You are obviously blind. Try Ethiopia, Botswana, Angola just to name a
few off the top of my head. Due to the long history of tribal tradition,
paternalistic, socialist regiemes experience high popularity.

Thats exactly right. Giving one exclusive power in ANY case is bad. I
would say that one of the very few things government might be good for
is enforcing anti trust regulations. Read Vinge's "Conquest by Default"
to understand my meaning.

Officially, no. Instead, dissidents are branded as lunatics. If you
conception of reality does not concord with the official majority
concept of reality, them you must be insane (that is the accepted
definition of insanity). So consequently, you get "socialized", or
"helped", or "reeducated" or simply drugged and electroshocked "for your
own good".  See our way is so fine and good that you must agree that we
are helping you get along. You do want to get along don't you..... Here
in the US, one is not "politically correct", or is a sexist, racist,
homophobe, "capitalist" (as if thats a bad thing), or baby seal killer,
even though one is not any of those things.

Capitalism promoted and developed with government support and

Canada has probably had the best opportunity to offer its citizens the
promise of bread and circuses of any nation in history. Since the US
basically paid for the majority of its defense for the last 50 years,
and benefits from the same maquiladoro type border economy as Mexico's
border states, they have been basically able to write a blank check so
long as their trade balance with the US has been positive. However, now
that trade protections are down, and the baby boom is starting to
retire, it has had to enforce a bit of fiscal sanity in order to keep
from bankrupting itself. I think this is good, in s pite of the short
term suffering. Dont' get me wrong, a girlfriend of mine who lives in
Ontario is not very happy with a Masters in Environmental Science and
unable to get a job, so I'm not an insensitive slob, but over the long
run, its a good thing.

What then? How are people going to live? Is everyone going to have their
own farm, their own factory that makes everything, and their own power
plant?  Granted, if (and thats still a big IF) nanotechnology fufills
its sci-fi promise, then we can each have all those things, and the only
two bases for trade will be information and relationships/entertainment,
but that still requires free trade )i.e. laissez faire capitalism to
work for maximum benefit for all, but that is still at a very minimum
20-50 years down the road. Don't hold your breath.

On Tuesday, November 05, 1996 2:55 PM, Eugene Leitl insisted:
<AR, not VR. VR is something you can buy even now. Requiring an artifical 
reality closely modeled after the pre-upload physical world is a weakness, 
imo.>

In these recent discussions, no one appears to considered the 'alternative' 
of 'ER', the type of things that Alexander Chislenko has written about 
ENHANCED REALITY at http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/EnhancedReality.html
(also published in Extropy #16):
<[A]ugment human senses with transparent external information 
pre-processors ... create personalized interactive illusions ... propelled 
by real events, but would show the world the way a person wants to see it 
... wiring exosomatic sensors to our nervous systems may allow us to better 
feel our environments ... virtualize and superimpose on the image of the 
real world your favorite mythological characters and imaginary companions, 
and provide other educational and recreational functions.>

This seems much more economical than trying to develop an AR from scratch: 
you wouldn't have to rely entirely on your own creations (the whole world 
is 'off-the-shelf'), you could interact with billions of other conscious 
beings all slicing and dicing and reaggregating the real-time feeds from 
around the wired universe along with you.

The BIG problem with this scenario, however, is that it might kill the 
sacred cow of "H. accelerans". The need (under ER) for real-world 
interaction and the desire to make use of *all* available substrates for 
data storage, communication and computation makes it unlikely that 
gradually uploaded, or augmented, minds would be much faster than analog 
meat minds (at least initially). Also, an ER-based mind would likely want 
to use distributed sensing and computing components.

On Thursday, October 31, 1996 12:04 PM, James Rogers objected that:
<Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if you 
don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may have access 
to vast quantities of information, but if you are still processing it or 
thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't much better off. [SNIP] 
Bandwidth and latency is also an issue.  A distributed intelligence would 
require some level of synchronization between its distributed components to 
operate in any type of coherent fashion.  Imagine if our neurons had to 
communicate with each other via UUCP!>

Still, on Monday, November 04, 1996, Michael Lorrey declared:
<I believe that the technology for slow gradual uploads will develop much 
sooner than a flash upload capability.>

And, 'way back' on Tuesday, October 29, 1996 6:34 AM, Algimantas Malickas 
wrote:
<I have wrote a paper "Gradual Uploading as a Cognition of Mind". It is 
placed in
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Uploading/gupload.html>

In this essay Malickas proposes:
<The gradual uploading requires addition of artificial neural network (or 
other means of AI) to the brain. After this, the brain and the external 
system would operate as one system. During this common coexistence, the 
memory and other functions of mind would gradually grow into the external 
system and would survive after the brain's death.>

Gradual uploading and ER have the advantage that they are things that can 
be worked on now (as opposed to John Clark's destructive "pulse gamma ray 
laser that can make a hologram of the human brain").  BUT, a serious 
disadvantage is that a gradual uploading approach, such as that proposed by 
Algimantas Malickas, might not be able to capture *all* of the memories and 
emotional/value preferences that might be burried in deep neural structures 
because, as Malickas admits:
<The gradual uploading would be uploading of mind functions, not uploading 
of a morphological brain architectures.>

This might even have advantages over simply copying the existing brain 
structure: we could throw out any emotional quirks we no longer want to be 
burdened with, experiment with removing obsolete structures left over from 
evolution, optimize various functions for the cyberspace environment, etc. 
 Still, judging from the recent posts from people fearful about losing 
their unique stream of consciousness, this might not be acceptable to those 
who want to be uploaded with all their organic experiences intact.

However, as Lyle Burkhead wrote in his Fri, 11 Oct 1996 post on 
"made-to-order cells", eventually:
<We will be able to design a very small "monitor cell" whose job it is to 
insinuate itself into the brain, and, in conjunction with millions of other 
such cells, keep track of everything that goes on in there.  [snip] If we 
are going to have a very fine-grained model of the brain, something like 
this will have to happen. We have to have sensors in there, picking up 
real-time information about how the neurons work, and this has to happen 
while the brain is "on," so to speak.>

Under this scenario, uploading would be a gradual process of 'raising your 
consciousness', slowly growing it into other, more permanent and flexible 
substrates, until eventually you've uploaded and *taught* your systems all 
'they' need to know about your data, rules, forms, views, experiences and 
goals, so that you've actually succeeded in *implanting* your consciousness 
into these cybernetic extensions of your biological being.

Now, if you go to all this effort, is the upload that remains really 'you'? 
That depends on how good a job *you* did in creating and informing your 
'higher' self.  Even an instantaneous and perfect upload of your current 
brain won't eliminate the need for alot of hard work at self 
transformation.

I did not percieve people as being fearful of losing all of it, but rather
desirous of keeping some of it.

OK, so DIR is a shell built-in command.  Choose some other, common,
non-built-in command, one that's used by such things as common
autoexec.bat files.  I know as little as possible about DOS, but this
kind of thing is trivially easy on UNIX.

It's worse than that (cf. the "education crisis"): the worse they do

I like to think that anyone can lead. The real question is whether
or not anyone chooses to follow. In my ideal world, everyone is
the leader of a contingent of one, and there are no followers.
But I'd be willing to settle for a world in which individual
followers each choose their several leaders with a bit more care
and consideration, and concentrate more on learning from their
chosen leaders than on trying to draft the other sheep into their
contingent. And leadership goes way beyond politics: there are
leaders in art, leaders in science, leaders in philosophy, leaders
in business, leaders in engineering... the list goes on and on,
and it is my hope that this list of different kinds of leadership,
different arenas of excellence, will keep growing.

And of course (pace Ira Brodsky), parents should lead their children.
But it would be nice to live in a world in which most people over, say,
25 years of age were adults in the sense hinted at above. 

The default paradigm of leadership seems to be "one leader, many
followers". I prefer "one follower (me), many leaders (those I have
chosen)". By picking and choosing which knowledges, skills, and
values to learn from which leaders, I remain an individual even
while engaging in the activity of following. And following in the
general sense is very important: anytime I am studying someone
else's work, I am following them. Following others is how we learn.
But following in the sense of "I'll let my leader have the final
say on what is good" is something I don't care for at all. This is
a fatal attitude even if one chooses 51% of the local population
for one's leader. What is legal, what is good: these are two
different questions, and ought to remain so, because the former
ought to be a closed question whenever possible, and the latter
has long been and remains an open question.

Subject: Sex as obsolete and "hormone-driven"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

The idea that sex has only one evolutionary function is too simple.
Very little in our makeup has "one function," and the longer something
stays around, the more functions it gets involved in.  Sex has been
around a long time.

It's another case where people are imagining an evolved system minus this
or that integral part.  Doesn't generally work that way, folks.  Evolution
keeps things.  The longer they've been around, the less likely they are
to be dispensable.

Sex has a function in culture, the meme pool.  So even non-biological
evolution will need to hold on to it.  Something similar probably goes
for human-like sexual differentiation and the gender memes that are
allied with it, for instance, although gender as we know it is a more
recent invention.

Besides, any sort of code-swapping between replicator sets *is* sex.
Recombo is the *main* reason for sex, so we might expect analogs to
the paraphenalia of sex to evolve alongside any meme-poolery.

The epithet "hormone driven" also strikes me as way uninformed
for a discussion among extropians.  Hormones are communication signals
between parts in complex systems.  Don't kill the system because of
its...messenger.  It's like saying that a certain part of a computer is
"green-wire-driven" because it happens to have a green wire in it.
So what?  And where is the part of your brain that is *not* hormone-
driven??  We're talking neurotransmitters, folks!  Axon to dentryte,
axon to dentryte, helLO-o!

The main thing I see in these simplistic notions is an attatchment
to old-fashioned prudery.  There's a better thing to evolve out of.

 The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual. But the 
businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste. The businesses made 
profit off the polluting industries, then, when told they had to take care 
of the harmful side effects. If the taxpayers gave these people money in 
order to make a profit (admittedly, jobs were created, but there is a 
better way than environmental degradation), then why should the taxpayers 
pay for the byproducts. It's like giving them money twice for them to 
make even more money.

That I can believe. But as soon as a business gets powerful, the government 
accepts them as part of the elite, and gives them tax breaks. Taxes,

Angola is currently waging war against it's people. I don't know much 
about Botswana. Ethiopia is doing relatively well, if it wasn't dealing 
with internal breakup with Eritea. Tribalism would not lead to socialism, 
as least not the type you see. YOu might get socialism within a tribe, 
but a doubt tribalism would accede to a centralize socialist government.

Do you have any evidence? I've talked to many people from those 
countries(Netherlands, other europeans countries like that) , even rabid 
skinheads from those places, and they don't compain of any ministry of 
truth. I don't hear any reports of the ministry of love coming to pick 
people up. This could be because I hang out on the wrong side of the net, 
but that's my experience.

El Salvador certainly was. If the U.S. hadn't pumped 6 billion into 
keeping the rich in power, there would be a popular government.  Chile was 
since pinochet came into power, but 
under the socialist democratic government, there weren't the same  blatant 
disregard for human rights. Nicaragua had a far better record for human 
rights under the Sandinistas than under Somoza. Guatamala is a U.S. 
puppet state, so companies like United Fruit can exploit the labour, 
prevent any attempt at social reform, and make more money.

You can still have trade. Under any system that allows it, people are going 
exchange stuff. It's when people who have capital dictate terms to those 
who don't that trade fails. Fair trade works, free trade doesn't,  Yes, I 
agree that people should take care of themselves 
first, but they shouldn't do it at the expense of other people. 

I would like people to become self-sufficient, but that's not going to 
happen anytime soon. Factories and farms are owned by the community, thus 
everybody gets a say on what activities the business is doing. No this is 
not state socialism. It's a business run democratically, so both the 
consumers and the workers have input, as to the residents of the area of 
the factory.

by  different means, then there MUST be a physical difference of some sort 
between them, the only alternative is to invoke the vague mystical powers 
that religion and superstition so love. If Science says he is the same  
person and the person says he is the same person then I feel very confident

You would be justified in worrying about this exactly as much as you worry 
that you are the only conscious being in the universe, the Turing Test is  
central to both ideas. If you trust it in one case you should trust it in  
the other. Anyway, it's self contradictory that something could think it's me,  
have my memories, think my thoughts, feel my feelings, and yet not be me,  
because that's what is mente by "me". At least, that's what I mean by the word.

No you have not. All you did was describe how exactly the same thing could be 
made in 2 different ways. Only the final product is important and if I show 
you that, you are unable to tell me which way it was made. If I purchase a  
paperback novel there is no way I could know, nor would I care, if the author 
originally wrote it with a quill pen, a IBM PC, an Apple, or scribbled it on 
the backs of  envelopes with a crayon. The finished product is the same and 
that's all that matters.

Show a demonstration of fitness and I'll think about it.

A demonstrably large percentage of the supposed intellectual elite
around today remind me more of the sniveling latinos of the late Roman
empire that let the barbarians in the gates, than the early ones whos
mother's told them, "Come home with your shield or on it."

As for leading today's whining masses? Excuse me I've got better things
to do. 

TO me, leading is by action and example, not by political maneuvering,
rhetorical warfare, and pandering to the most common denominators.  I
would show much more leadership by getting the hell off this planet just
to prove that all the crap that people claim is a bunch of nonsense.

Why wouldn't they be able to keep all their organic experiences intact with
a gradual incremental upload? Your brain would slowly be converted to a new
faster medium neuron by neuron. Imagine your brain running on a quantum

But two atoms of exactly the same kind *do* have individuality and that
individuality is that they cannot occupy the same space at the same time.
Their "individuality" is based on spacial location.

Popular opinion, yes but it should be decided by which organism is the most

Perhaps creation or discovery of a silicon-based lifeform would be a large
step toward uploading because a silicon based lifeform would possibly be
more versatile than a carbon based one due to the complexity of the genetic
architecture needed to support it. Some of the most successful organisms
grow where the fewest resources exist.

Michael Lorrey said, "universal translators "may" be possible".

With regards to aliens, the "may" ought to be stressed infinitely more.  I 
think it is extremely unlikely that any sort of "universal translator" will 
ever be possible.  My belief is that the sum of all human thinking is an 
almost insignificantly small subset of all possible ways of thinking.  I 
believe that nearly all ways of thinking are incomprehensible to the human 
mind.  Shit, most of the ideas I think about would be nearly incomprehensible 
to anyone not as intimately familiar with my mind as I am.  Nearly everything 
I think is impossible to translate into language that other humans would 
understand (I do try my best, though.  But what I'm able to translate is only 
a small subset of my thinking).  I think the situation would be even worse 
with aliens.  Communication is only possible among sufficiently similar 
systems.  Communication is a form of resonance, a way for one system to cause 
another to behave similarly.  The greater the resonance, the greater the 
communication between two systems.  If two systems aren't similar enough, they 
can't cause each other to resonate together.  They can't mimic each other to a 
high enough degree to be considered to be communicating.  Human minds share 
enough similarities that they can create sensory experiences for each other 
which cause their minds to think similarly about various things.  We can guess 
the mental patterns of another human, based on how they're acting (what sounds 
they're making, what bodily movements they're expressing, things like that).  
We're good enough at guessing each other's mental states that we can maintain 
a reasonable level of communication.  And the better we get to know someone, 
the more accurately we learn to guess what they're thinking, based on their 
actions.  I don't think we'd have much luck guessing what a being truly alien 
was thinking.  Not well enough to communicate, I think.  

I think that one of the basic reasons that humans have even the low level of 
communication that we do is because we mimic each other so much.  We mimic 
each other's forms of expression so much that we have developed a lot of 
common forms of expression that we use with each other.  Thus, we build a lot 
of similar memories.  We also have grown up in similar cultural and physical 
environments, so we have at least some common ground.  I see no reason to 
expect that aliens will have much at all in common with us in our thinking and 
our ways of doing things.

If they are short sighted, why do you want them to have the authority?
If the businesses invested under the instigation of the government, the
government has a responsibility to fulfill its end of the bargain. 

Nuclear Power is a phenomenal example: The reason why nuclear power
costs are so high is that, legal costs aside, over 25% of the cost of a
kWh here in the US from a nuke plant are government fees. These fees are
collected, as a part of the licensing agreement, for the specific
purpose of building long term, safe, radioactive waste containment
facilities. The trust fund is now HUGE (about 200 billion dollars), far
more than is needed to build the waste site. Yet does has the government
YET opened a waste site, 50 years after starting this program? Nope.
They just finished building a low level site, which is being contested
by the state gov't it is in, but the high level site, under Yuma
Mountain in the Nevada Desert, where there isn't a drop  of water to
pollute, a fault to tremble, ar a person to scare, for at least 100
miles, is still being fought over, basically because the congressional
delegation from Nevada can't get enough pork barrel project funding from
the congress, and California won't give up the fight it's in with Nevada
of water rights in a completely different issue.

Meanwhile, all the nuke plants across the country must build their own
"temporary" storeage facilities, the cost of which is also added onto
the cost of power generated, plus all the legal fights brought up by the
mere existence of the storeage facility is being there, so the community
gets ticked off...

That is only if the people allow a system of government that enables
such oligarcal/monoplistic practices. As Benjamin Franklin said,"A
nation which would give up a certain measure of freedom for greater
security will wind up with neither. People get the government they vote
for, and deservedly so. Just take a look at the election here in the US
as a phenomenal example.....

The funny thing Suresh, you quote Marx, Lenin, what have you, but you
completely ignore the KEY tenet of marxist socialist philosophy: that
EVERY economy must first pass through an industrial/capitalist phase to
fully develop the information based society that enables perfect
socialism.  To try to force socialism prematurely is a waste, and can
cause much conflict, bloodshed, tyranny, and even a retrogression into a
fuedalistic state. Not only do you need to get some experience in the
world, but you need to read your Marx a bit more. I did. I followed Sun
Tzu's advice:"Know your enemy, and know yourself."

Thats because it's called the Ministry of Health, Education, and Welfare
And of course, nobody hears about it, if they did, they would be insane
too, because such things do not happen in a socialist democracy. One is

Now you are blaming everyone but the people for their problems. They get
the government they are willing to put up with. if not they can will and
should get another one. If they like getting repressed, they'll get
that.

Nicaragua had a good record in the human rights that the liberal media
cares about. The central one, being able to vote for your leaders, was
curiously denied.

If I've got something, and you want it, I'm only going to give it to
you  if I can profit at selling it. If thats too much for you then you
need to find someone else who has it cheaper. Thats free trade. What you
are talking about is what is fair for YOU, not anyone else.

Sorry the world does not work that way. There ain't no such thing as a
free lunch, buddy.

Yes it is. It's called giving every one a free and equal chance to screw
things up. Look at the Kibbutzes in Isreal: if the government wasn't
subsidizing them, they'd be ghost towns. 

Sure polluters should be held liable but should also be given a way to
take care of the problems. 99% of the time, things don't get fixed cause
there is a government regulation in the way.

You want to talk about businesses ripping people off? Try the
environmental remediation businesses, that are typically owned by people
who used to be government environmental experts who got the laws passed
to clean things up certain ways. They then get their bureaucrat buddies
to create HUGE out of proportion fines, and mandate the certain cleanup
methods that the former bureacrats now are in business to provide.
Consequently, they charge HUGE rates, far above costs, more than any
other business I've even seen, when what they usually do is just mix
dirt with dishwashing soap and then rinse it. (of course, its
conveniently repackaged as "remediation" material, not something that
can be bough for pennies at CostCo. 



No, you REALLY need to get some experience in living in the real world.
youseem to be a good natured sort, but you tend to wish the world worked
in a way that would best suite YOU. Funny thing is Suresh, thats the
basis for free trade. We ALL want the world to work that way, but we are
rational enough to see tha if it did, we would be stepping on everyone
elses toes. We just try to get whats best for us so long as the people
we deal with feel that they are getting whats best for them. That is
free trade. That IS fair and equitable.

You just don't like people having power over you to make you do what you
don't want to do. Here's a secret: the government has the power to do it
the most. Businesses you can sue to the high heavens, but government
only lets you sue them if they agree to let you sue them. Business only
acts like a government when the government is in their pocket, and it
takes YOU to vote it that way.

Figure out who your real target is.....

Suresh Naidu said, "The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual. 
But the businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste."

I would correct this statement, to make it more accurate.  It was *PEOPLE in 
the businesses* who dumped the waste.  There were certain, specific 
individuals who dumped that waste, and the fact that they were business owners 
has as much relevance as their skin or eye color to the fact that they were so 
unethical that they would do such a horrible thing.  These polluters are 
highly unethical people who HAPPEN to be business owners as well.  Being 
business owners didn't *cause* them to be evil polluters.  Capitalism doesn't 
CAUSE people to be unethical.  Yes, there are unethical people who trade in 
the capitalist system who ALSO do very bad things, but to decry all of 
capitalism and business because of the acts of a few assholes who fuck people 
over is as stupid and irrational as being racist because one black guy attacks 
you and steals your clothes.

Suresh, you're over-generalizing, BIG-TIME!  You're standing in the middle of 
a battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy alike.  "The enemies are humans; 
shoot the enemies.  All humans are enemies; shoot all humans"  is the same as 
"The bad people who pollute and fuck people over are business people; stop 
them from committing their evil acts.  All business people are evil; stop all 
businesses."  Both are examples of very bad logic.  Yet this is exactly the 
logic you are using.

Check your thinking; you've got a bad meme in there somewhere, trying to take 
over your mind.

Find out what the REAL enemy is.  It's not business.  It's not even 
government.  There's something much deeper.  And until you understand the real 
sources of the world's problems, all your grand plans for society will be 
misguided and ineffective.

Not me.  I read mail in emacs using Telnet over a SLIP connection.  I
haven't found anything yet that has the automatic filing/filtering
capabilities of vm under emacs, so I'll be a dumb tty until everyone
else catches up.

For me, the fact that my mail reader knows to save your mail in the
~/Mail/Extr/extro file is much more important than some bold fonts.

*** Scientists find oldest evidence of life on Earth

Life may have emerged from Earth's primordial slime millions of years
before scientists thought it did, a team of international researchers
reported Wednesday. They said they had found evidence that bacteria or
something equally tiny lived in what is now Greenland 3.8 billion
years ago--not very long after the planet became fit for life.
Currently, the earliest known fossils are 3.5 billion years old. The
researchers found traces of carbon in apatite crystals that seem to
have been created by living organisms. For the full text story, see

 *** Short people may live longer, U.S. study finds

 New research has uncovered a possible link between height and life
 expectancy. U.S. scientists found that dwarf mice with a hormone
 deficiency lived up to twice as long as mice of normal size. The key
 seemed to be a lack of growth hormone. The researchers compared 28
 normal and 34 dwarf mice which were kept in the same conditions and
 fed the same food. They found the dwarfs lived much longer, with a
 difference of more than 350 days for males and more than 470 days for
 females. For the full text story, see

IAN: Talk about the "one size fits all" syndrome, how pathetic.
Thanks for this example. I'm compiling info on DARE. Many studies
have shown no effect to a negative effect, such that kids who take
the DARE course are MORE inclined to use drugs. That's exactly what 
I predicted, the forbidden fruit syndrome. If you tell kids, "Don't
go in that room...Don't go in that room..." where do you think 
they're going to go as soon as you leave them alone. "Gee what's
all the fuss about, what's in that room, it must be something 
special. I've got to see..." I predicted that outcome and  
wrote about a few years back on the internet -- I've 
got to try to dig that up. 

Now Clinton is talking about giving DARE more funding. You'd think 
they want people using more drugs, heck, the CIA's even running 
the drugs. Hmmmm... A mercantile govt drug running monopoly;
economically and profitably, very logical indeed.

Sorry Dave, that sounds like psychomystical claptrap to me. The fact is
that using mathematics, and our knowledge of the physical laws, we
already have a Rosetta Stone to relate with any technological society of
aliens. If they were non technological, I'm not sure it would be so
easy. The fact that we would be two intelligent races with scientists
makes for a huge overlap of common ground from which to build greater
communication.

Who ever said that humans have a  "low" level of communication?

The fact that any one human can have such diverse thoughts shows that we
have the diversity of thought to communicate with many different modes
of intelligent existence. Now I know the first objection is gonna be
"What about the whales? we can't understand them and they have such big
brains they MUST be intelligent." Wrong. Their minds are almost totally
occupied with  the vast signal processing required by their sonar
system. Did you know that they can create a sonic image of the whole
pacific ocean? That takes major processing. That does not leave much
room for abstract thought. Plus if you look at their brian mass to body
mass ratio, they would still be far below humans, as are all othr earth
animals.

For support of my scientific Rosetta Stone idea, I direct you to read H.
Beam Piper's short story collection "Federation" (this was long before
star trek), in which a human expedition to Mars uncovers a dead
civilization. They think they can't ever decode the language till they
come across a Martian copy of the table of the elements.....

Even if Malthus was an entropic bastard, his argument is valid. We cannot
expand faster than light, and inside a bounded volume (like spacelike
slices of our future lightcone) the Bekenstein Bound seems to hold. This
implies that exponential growth of *anything* only is possible in the
"short" term (which could be *very* long), then it has to grow as t^3 or
slower (assuming a Minkovsky spacetime). 

[To circumvent this we need either a way to expand FTL, build interlinked
wormhole empires or break the Bekenstein Bound. None of these are known to
be possible (although the wormholes might be less unlikely than the
others)]

I think you are drawing the distinction between personal responsibility and
leadership.  Personal responsibility is about recognizing you have control
over what you do -- you choose your own role models and mentors.

The problem arises when people confuse personal responsibility with
self-indulgence.

Today's politicians are care-takers, not leaders in the classic sense.  The
self-indulgent see nothing wrong with redistribution of income -- as long
as *they* are on the receiving end.

The problem with today's teachers is they have stopped teaching; education
is now "child-centered."  The self-indulgent believe you learn what you
want to learn when you want to learn it.

The problem with parents is they are told and believe the village will
raise their kids.  The self-indulgent are too busy to tackle this complex
problem.  Let somebody else figure it out.

Intellectual and moral leadership have become passe in Western culture.
Today's heroes are basketball players.  The self-indulgent are too busy
feeling good to have any time for noble actions or noble thoughts.

Can we all lead?  Sure, through personal responsibility we can lead
ourselves.  But you have to master that before you can lead others.

Just think of me as a very pro-technology reactionary. <g>

        by Ian Williams Goddard

        In Louisville, Kentucky, two men, Fadel Salem and 
        Mohammad Khalid, were recently released after serv-
        ing two days in jail for what police believed was 
        cocaine but turned out not to be [1].

        The men were held in prison until the lab tests 
        confirmed that the "fist-sized white chunks pack-
        aged in plastic" were not cocaine, whereupon the 
        judge ordered that the suspects be released. 

        The two men spent their two days behind bars 
        trying to convince the police that the assumed 
        contraband was powdered yogurt, which is apparent-
        ly often sold in this fashion in Middle Eastern 
        stores. The police dog is also reported to have
        indicated a "hit" on the packages.  More likely 
        this "hit" was simply the dogs way of saying, 
        "Mmmm, that smells good, I want some."

        These men, caught in the middle of the insane
        war on powdered substances and dried flowers
        should sue the police department for wrongful
        arrest and imprisonment. How should it be that
        a dog's taste for yogurt should ever result in
        people being locked in a cage? Insanity defined.

end, the Powers are reduced to operating through 'mere' human forms and 
some 'magnetic slime mold' (the Countermeasure - a more serious 'mystical' 
crutch, BTW, than FTL travel) in order to stop the Blight.

Is the infected human Pham really just "His [Old One's] robot at the Bottom 
of the Beyond." 'No!" says Ravna, "you're human, and we're just working for 
the same things."

These "same things" are the Patterns that Powers may play with at the Top, 
advanced races may trade in at the Middle, but only certified, 
uncontrolable primitives like humans (see experimental evidence from 
Hanse), can actually implement at the Bottom.

At the risk of appearing Deathist, I might even suggest that it is 
primarily the threat of death that inspires humans to master the magic of 
self transformation.  Without this capability (ST), be we Power, Blight or 
Flenser, we are all Godscatter in the end.

He's no prophet (I humbly hope), only a warner. (Interesting: "malthus"

Um, last time I looked population growth was still hyperbolic. It may 
not have topped some extrapolation, yet it certainly has dwarfed the 
majority of them. Of course, if you have some recent, less gloomy data I 
am always ready to be convinced...

Anyway, there is no such thing as unlimited growth in a limited universe 
(ok, it might not be limited, but we cannot tell yet). You might expand 
into space almost at the speed of light, but trailing just after the life 
shock wave a saturation zone exists. The maximum concentration of beings on 
a given petri dish, medium being atoms and energy. 

At least that's what current mainstream physics says.

Wrong?

Capitalism encourages people to be unethical. The most unethical can be 
the most profitable, althought this is not always the case, it happens 
way too frequently. The amount of environmental damage one person 
can do when he doesn't have total control over a large organization is far less. 
On his own he could pollute a small piece of land, as the 
businessman he can destroy an entire ecosystem. Capitalism gives power to 
the unethical so they can do more damage.

The bad people who pollute and fuck over people are the ones with the 
most power in capitalism. That's a method of getting rich, forfeiting 
ethics in favour of profits. Thus, the ones who get power are the 
unethical ones. You may call it pragmatic, but I call it nasty. This is 
the logic I'm following: Profits can be earned by the nastiest methods 
possible, thus the unethical  ones in society will accumulate the most 
money, and thus power. 

While I acknowledge that not all business people are evil, some are 
ignorant of the effects their number crunching has on other people, and 
some are trying to help, but don't know how to do it and remain 
competitive. It's very hard to be nice and

Okay, can you tell me??? If I find it I'll let you know. I really wish
there was some cabal of people (y'know, like the Roscrucians, Freemasons,
Illuminati, Communists, Capitalists, Muppets, Extropians) making
the world bad, then at least you could direct efforts to topple it.

 But I guess the fault lies with
ourselves, and all the failings currently being human entails. This isn't
something you can fight without indoctorination or massive dosages of
Prozac(Television?).

 The
reason I advocate anarchy is because I hope it will
encourage the same principles of mutual aid that have helped us evolve to
this point, so we can develop into a species that will take itself to the
stars. <ahhh, starry dreamy eyes>

(I hate vi)

I know the real enemy is not big business. But they are a sore point in
society. The real enemy is .... RICHARD SIMMONDS(sorry...I'll take my
methadone). It sucks that people are sometimes rapacious, brutal and
savage,but
that's why we need to keep power imbalances from happening, so that
nobody, regardless of how "benevolent", can dictate terms to anyone else.
The last thing anybody wants is to have brutal people have power over you,
so the only way to prevent this from happening is to minimize the absolute 
power anyone has over anybody else.
     

Let's face it, any system would work if people were a bit "nicer".

James Howard responds:

I used medline to check for citations regarding melatonin, about a month or two
ago.  For the 1994-1996 years, it provided 467 references.  For 1993, there are
347 citations.  For 1992, there are 363; for 1991, there are 329, etc.  Between
1960 and 1971, there were 230.  I suggest that many of you, who are interested
in melatonin, should use medline to find these listings.  Many of them have
abstracts that are available through medline.  Read them for yourselves; you can
understand them.  This will help to avoid the "miracle" or "scam" label that has
been variously attributed to melatonin.

I have produced a mechanism of sleep, based on melatonin and DHEA, that one can
find at http://www.naples.net/~nfn03605 on the web.  (For the cynics among you:
I do not sell any product or service, nor am I associated in any manner or form
with any entity (person, company, corporation, etc.) that does.)

Hey, Homer had a better story on that than Plato did, IMHO. :)

My point was that such talk is cheap, not unlike Confucius's 
"Rectification of Names"--"A student should study, a teacher should

Dreams probably serve in a similar funtion to the scandisk/defrag
functions on a computer. Imagine the entire database of information one
stores from video, sound, touch, smell, and taste in just one day,
enough to recall any detail under hypnosis. One would have to defrag
once a day to keep it all organized for long term use.

Actually uploading in one's sleep would not be a bad idea then, just
inject an RNA code into the person to defrag the mind into this brand
new hooked up capacity while spleeping, or even just part of it, to keep
the body hooked up if that is wanted. it may take one night or as much
as a whole year of nights to shift everything over. I imagine if it took
one night that you'd have one hell of a chip-ache hangover in the
morning.

Actually, there are a few cetaceans that have a higher brain mass to body
mass ratio that humans.  The dolphin is one of them.  The dolphin also has a
more convoluted brain than humans.  They exhibit complex intelligent speech
patterns as well.

I disagree about the signal processing issue, though.  Cetaceans have
excellent audio capabilities, but mediocre, non-stereoscopic vision and
vision processing.  Humans have mediocre audio capabilities, but very good
visual processing capabilities.  Humans receive something like 90% of their
sensory input through their eyes.

I used to work on DSP applications, mostly audio, but occasionally graphics
oriented.  Visual processing applications almost always require an order of
magnitude more processing power than audio ones.  I have heard the argument
before, but I have a difficult time believing that cetaceans use more of
their brain for audio processing than we use for vision.  State-of-the-art
audio rendering software can run in realtime on a processor capable of less
than 200-mips.  

Also, our hearing is more capable than most people think.  I have seen
experiments where blind people were able to echo-locate objects with a cross
section of 1 square inch in a room using their own voice, and could detect
changes in position of 3" at a distance of 15' of objects with a
cross-section of 1 square inch.  Non-blind people tend to only have a range
of 3-7', but everyone possesses the capability.  I actually took one of
these tests.  My effective range was 5-6'.  Most people don't know they can
do it until they try.

Actually, taking into account the limits on migration imposed by
national borders to examine the population curves, it seems to be more
of a third order equation....

How so? Capitalism which is unresponsive to shareholders and consumers
may be, but it is not a corporations job to teach that. Corporations
tend to do background checks on new employees, and develop files on the
integrity of the individuals. I would not hire someone who had
demonstrated poor integrity in the past, as that person is also likely
to steal from or take actions which may damage the company.

It took one drunk to cause the Alaska oil spill, and he wasn't an

Profits like that can only be earned in the short term. With free
communication like the internet, it is much harder to hide such events,
bringing ever more likely the swift retribution of a corporations'
consuming customers. WIth government in charge, spills are a matter of
"national security", and reporting such things is treason.

Look at all the nuclear and chemical wasteland in Russia. you probably
don't know about them, other than Chernobyl, but they are a whole lot
worse than ANYTHING that has ever happened in the west, and that was by
a PEOPLE's government.

You are starting to get it. Free market IS anarchy. How decent our
society is is only a matter of how decent its individual components
(i.e. people) are, as it is sthe same with corporations.

Monopolies of any kind only happen with government connivance and media
acquiescence.

If you join us in the fight to prevent both, you are on your way.....

I agree that this issue came out looking great!  Max did a bang-up job,
Natasha added some nice typographic elements (the "Advances" graphic works
very well), and several adjunct editors put in long hours.

One thing I especially like about this issue:  It highlights the work of
Extropian women.  They earned some justly deserved credit for enriching
transhumanist thought.

I thank everyone who helped produce EXTROPY -- and everyone who consumes it!

I'm not at all sure what you mean here.  The concepts stimulated in my

Powers are explicitly somewhat de-mystified.  Transcendance isn't a
mysterious disappearance, a la _Marooned in Realtime_.  It's having a
really big brain and being able to construct sentients to order and
having loyal nanomold.  The Gods don't have strange powers beyond our

Well yes, they don't have telekinesis.  To move something they have to
do some action to move something.  This is what I _liked_ -- the Powers
don't manipulate matter through direct consciousness; they have tools,
like us.  That's why it is harder SF.

And I don't see what Countermeasure is more of a crutch than FTL.  It's
a flexible nano-thingy, which could probably construct jump vanes if
programmed to.  It does something Zonal instead, befitting an object
from the High Transcend.

I suspect I haven't grasped what you meant.

What sort of planets?  Big super-Jovians, which are the ones we can

Uh.  The problem here is having organizations where lots of people will
do what someone else wants.  Such seem to be endemic to the human
species.  But in an ideal system a business could only ruin its own
land, which it would probably prefer not to do, while a bad government
can ruin everything.

In the real world, there's public land, and even more public air and
water, and yes, unethical businesses cheerily go after those.  So do
unethical individuals, such as sheep farmers on early English commons,
or everyone who drives a car.

A very common solution, used by many tribes through accusations of
sorcery.  "He's wealthy, he must be using sorcery, he caused my chickens
to become sick."  None of these tribes are going to the stars any time
soon.

Top-down: have a really big power that can easily minimize anyone else's
power.  The problem is obviously to control the great power.

Yep.  But anarcho-capitalism hopes to work by letting people's

Anarcho-socialism, or whatever you want to call it, seems to require

But because our brains aren't sequentially-based, it must have something to

Does this have to do with blowing virtual air though a virtual model to
produce a sound? I saw on the telivision show "Beyond 2000" a technology
where they would stick a instrument into a person's throat and map out
their voice box with a laser and make a 3D model of it. With the 3D model
they were able to make the person actually sing using the model. When the
internet VR 'metaverse' comes around in say 5-10 yrs max we will be able to
create characteristic voices for our avatars. Does anyone know of a link to
ongoing research about this topic?

The latest is actually in the biozone, though it is a jovian type
planet, which could easily have earth sized moons. The jovian planets
are the easiest to spot as they are the biggest and empart the most
influence on their suns gravity wize. This does not mean there would be
no earthlike planets, actually it makes them more likely, once you
understand the process of planet formation as a function of stellar
bleeding of angular velocity. If a star has got one planet, it's likely
to have more....

We are detecting a few smaller planets, though still not as small as
earth, more like between Neptune and Earth sized. They have even
detected water in liquid form on the latest discovery, which may be
water on one of its moons....

A few people are working on a process to detect chlorophyll....

Comparing a humans ability to echolocate an object in a room to a whale
creating a topographical image of the entire pacific ocean with one honk
is quite a bit of a stretch.

I would like to find out where you get the information that dolphins had
a greater brain/body mass ratio. What I had heard previously was they
had about 80% of our capacity at best.

ANyways, this is WAY off topic, as neither whales or dolphins have
anything like technology, so my argument still stands: We will have no
real big probelms communicating with an intelligent technological
civilization due to mathematics and science commonality.

Just the fact that dolphins and whales have such comparable brain/body
mass ratios, yet have not developed technology as we have proves my
other point, that the most likely body scheme for an intelligent
technological alien would be bipedals, with hands, as technology is the
result of an omnivorous creature with hands and no real defense
capabilities other than its hands and brain. Cetaceans have no need for
hands, and thus technology, so are stuck in an evolutionary trap
preventing them from becoming a technological civilization, unless we
"uplift" them a la David Brin.

Suresh, the reason why corporations that pollute do so and get away with
it is because it is on "public" land. Here's a little ditty to explain
it:

The problem with common ownership is that something which belongs to
everybody actually winds up belonging to nobody because everybody
wouldn't take care of it, and nobody was responsible. Somebody came
along and (polluted/stole/trashed/ you pick it) it. Nobody thought that
somebody would do it, but everybody just sat there watching, because it
was nobody's job to take make sure that didn't happen. Somebody said, I
own it now, and if anybody wants it, they are going to have to pay me to
use it, and while everybody objected, nobody would do anything.

See.....

If things belong to people as individuals, then they will take care of
them, and make sure nothing happens to them. Common ownership is
abandonment.

Depending on response, I'll see if I can co-ordinate some sort of conjunction.

Thanks Tom, but this description seriously short-changes Natasha's input.
She did far more than add some "nice typographic elements". She created the
main image for the cover, and as Art Director either created or helped shape
many of the layouts in the issue.

>very well), and several adjunct editors put in long hours.

This seems like a good time to clarify: I said that there are two people on
the production team. That's the in-house production team who put the issue
together, do all the design, layout, and production. In addition, there are
editors who sometimes help get articles into shape. This time, rather than
"several adjunct editors" let me thank publically the two who helped out:
Eric Watt Forste for co-editing the Advances section, and T.O. Morrow for
his roles both as Politics Editor and Puzzles Editor (the latter,
unfortunately not credited). 

I wish there were more editors to help gather and edit material for Extropy.

please contact me at: extropy@extropy.org

I intend to continue giving appropriate attention to extropic women as well

but I do believe in giving attention where it's due.

My thanks especially to those of you who subscribe and thereby support the
existence of the only magazine of its kind. And to those extropians who are
not subscribers I ask -- why not?! (Subscription info is available on
request, or on the ExI web site: http://www.extropy.org)

Praise for the magazine is always enjoyable, but I'd also enjoy input on

We now know from experiments on Bell's inequality that if hidden variables
exist at all (most think they probably don't) they can not be the sort that
Einstein had in mind, they can't be local. Also, drinking a cup of coffee
will change you much more that quantum uncertainty ever will

Not all particles have this property (photons) but you are correct, atoms do.
It's called The Pauli Exclusion Principle.


                >Their "individuality" is based on spacial location.


It's interesting that the Pauli Exclusion Principle can only be derived, in
fact it only makes sense, if we use an obscure idea in pure Philosophy, and
assume the exact opposite of what you say above. In 1690 the philosopher and
co-inventor of The Calculus, Leibniz, wrote about something he called
" The Identity Of Indiscernibles ". He said that things that you can measure
are what's important, and if there is no way to find a difference between two
things then they are identical and switching the position of the objects does
not change the physical state of the system. Until this century few thought
this idea was important, nobody thought it had observable consequences,
because nobody could find two things that were exactly alike. Things changed
dramatically when it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to
tell them apart.

The Schrodinger Wave Equation is one of the first and greatest discoveries in
Quantum Mechanics. It proved to be enormously useful in accurately predicting
the results of experiments, and as the name implies it's an equation
describing the movement of a wave, but embarrassingly it was not at all clear
what it was talking about. Exactly what was waving? Schrodinger thought it
was a matter wave, but that didn't seem right to Max Born. Born reasoned that
matter is not smeared around, only the probability of finding it is. Born was
correct, whenever an electron is detected it always acts like a particle, it
makes a dot when it hit's a phosphorus screen not a smudge, however the
probability of finding that electron does act like a wave so you can't be
certain exactly where that dot will be. Born showed that it's the square of
the wave equation that describes the probability, the wave equation itself is
sort of a useful mathematical fiction, like lines of longitude and latitude,
because experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a
particle, we can only measure the intensity (square) of the wave function
[F(x)]^2 because that's a probability and probability we can measure.

Let's consider a very simple system with lots of space but only 2 particles
in it.  P(x) is the probability of finding two particles x  distance apart,
and we know that probability is the square of the wave function, so
P(x) =[F(x)]^2. Now let's exchange the position of the particles in the
system, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x but is now x2 - x1 = -x.
 
The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the two particles are
the same, no measurable change has been made, no change in probability,
so P(x) = P(-x). Probability is just the square of the wave function so
[ F(x) ]^2 = [F(-x)]^2 . From this we can tell that the Quantum wave function
can be either an even function, F(x) = +F(-x), or an odd function,
F(x) = -F(-x). Either type of function would work in our probability equation
because the square of minus 1 is equal to the square of plus 1. It turns out
both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,
Bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin, Fermions,
have odd wave functions.

If we put two Fermions like electrons in the same place then the distance
between them, x , is zero and because they must follow the laws of odd wave
functions, F(0)  = -F(0), but the only number that is its own negative is
zero so  F(0)  =0 . What this means is that the wave function F(x) goes to
zero so of course  [F(x)]^2 goes to zero, thus the probability of finding two
electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is The Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Two identical bosons, like photons of light, can sit on top of each other but
not so for fermions, The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2 identical
electrons can not be in the same orbit in an atom. If we didn't know that
then we wouldn't understand Chemistry, we wouldn't know why matter is rigid
and not infinitely compressible, and if we didn't know that atoms are
interchangeable we wouldn't understand any of that.

NANOSCALE ABACUS.  Scientists at IBM Zurich have used a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) probe to reposition C-60
molecules on a copper substrate, making in effect the first room-
temperature device capable of storing and manipulating numbers
at the single molecule level.  The buckyballs (which are big,
sturdy molecules) act as the counters of a tiny abacus in which
low (indeed mono-atomic) terraces in the copper surface
constrain the buckyballs to move accurately in a straight line.
(The abacus is perhaps the first human calculating device, and the
Greek word means "sand on a board.")  IBM researcher James
Gimzewski (gim@zurich.ibm.com) admits that his device is
slow: "The tool we use (the STM probe) is the equivalent of
operating a normal abacus with the Eiffel Tower."  But things
should improve in coming years; with this new advance,
hundreds of buckyball ranks could fit neatly inside the same
linewidth that characterizes features on a Pentium processor chip. 
As for speed, engineers expect to fabricate arrays of hundreds
and even thousands of STM probes for simultaneously imaging
(and repositioning) many atoms and molecules.  (M.T. Cuberes

  Reuter excerpt:

  TWA flight 800 shot by US missile, Salinger says 

  20:37 Nov 07, 1996 EST 

  NICE, France, Nov 8 (Reuter) - Former White House adviser Pierre 
  Salinger said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy missile accidentally 
  shot down the TWA    airliner which crashed off New York in July 
  killing all 230 people aboard. 

  Salinger told airline officials an agent of the U.S. secret service 
  gave him a document in Paris showing the airliner had entered an 
  area where the U.S. Navy was carrying out missile tests. 

  ``The airliner was not the target of an attack...It was shot down 
  by a missile fired from a U.S. Navy vessel,'' he said. 

  He said the airliner had taken off late from New York and was flying 
  lower than its scheduled altitude of 20,000 feet to steer clear of 
  another aircraft. 

  The airport control tower, in ``a tragic error,'' failed to inform 
  the Navy, Salinger said. 

  ``The truth must come out,'' he said.

IAN: When I think of the avalanche of vicious ad hominem abuse 
I took in the newsgroups for simply suggesting EXACTLY what Former 
White House adviser Pierre Salinger has now come out and said to 
be true from first hand knowledge, it proves what a bunch of fact-
blind GovtMedia news feeding and worshiping zombies most people 
are. This PROVES we are feed a pack of lies; this PROVES that the 
U.S. media is guilty of a conspiracy to suppress the truth in 
defense of the U.S. govt because all the facts necessary to 
reach the this just revealed truth have been there from day 
one (notice that this news comes from Reuters in England); and 
this proves that the bulk of conspiracy researchers quickly and 
accurately divulged the real scoop and were smeared viciously 
for doing so. If you want to get closest to the truth, research 
conspiracy theory sources.

I laid this TWA 800 GovtMedia scam story all out, see: 

        http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm

Also see my (9/28/96) TWA 800 article in The Goddard Chronicles
at DEEP TIMES:

        http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/

Hell, ya got to toot your horn a little, particularly after 
being sh*t on so much for getting the truth out, for example:

The current issue of GEORGE Magazine smears people who suggest
that the govt may have shot-down TWA 800 as clueless paranoids.
They even quote me. Yet I gave them the facts, culled right out 
of quickly disappearing media quotations, that 156 witnesses re-
ported seeing a missile hit the plane and GEORGE Magazine censored 
these facts that they had in hand, and then they turn around and 
call those who know the facts, which they also know, "clueless." 
It's a naked con job. 

As Former White House adviser Pierre Salinger just said:

        ``The truth must come out.''

Yet I'll bet this report too will just disappear, and anyone 
who remembers it will also be a "clueless paranoid nut case."

After reading my post on the unlikelyhood of "universal translators" and being 
able to communicate with aliens, and a brief explaination of the basis for 
human communication, Michael Lorrey commented: 

"Sorry Dave, that sounds like psychomystical claptrap to me. The fact is that 
using mathematics, and our knowledge of the physical laws, we already have a 
Rosetta Stone to relate with any technological society of aliens. If they were 
non technological, I'm not sure it would be so easy. The fact that we would be 
two intelligent races with scientists
makes for a huge overlap of common ground from which to build greater 
communication."

First of all, what aspects of my post make it sound like "psychomystical 
claptrap"?  I think the concept of resonance between systems (broadly meaning 
that they cause each other to behave similarly) is a farily scientific concept 
(tuning forks are the classic example).  The idea the humans mimic each other 
is a matter of observable fact.  I don't see anything in my post that I would 
imagine someone could see as "psychomystical claptrap".  

I understand what you're saying about the Rosetta Stone and using our common 
base of scientific knowledge to develop forms of communication with aliens.  
However, I can conceive of possible alien beings who are technologically 
advanced and who have a very good understanding of the regularities of the 
universe (the knowledge that we discover through science), but whose concepts 
and ways of thinking are still profoundly different than ours.  I am thinking 
that our way of doing science and finding out how the universe works is only 
one of many ways to approach understanding the universe.  It may be that our 
science is simply a way that is especially well suited to the human brain.  

I imagine that alien beings would have developed their own, unique ways of 
developing accurate knowledge, which would likely be profoundly different from 
our own.  They may come to understand the various properties of the different 
elements and learn how to take advantage of those properties, but the way they 
organize their knowledge and represent it to each other may be quite 
profoundly different from our Periodic Table of the Elements.  It makes sense 
to us to arrange all the elements on a chart, grouped according to similar 
properties and in order of atomic weight, but it only makes sense because of 
the particular ways that we have developed to think about things.  Evolution 
on a different planet would likely yield intelligent beings with very 
different ways of thinking about things and approaching things.

Humans seem to have a hard time imagining that intelligent beings might think 
in ways profoundly different than we do.  We tend to think that our way of 
intelligence is the only way.  It's difficult to imagine other ways of 
thinking; they are too alien to our minds.  Humans also tend to  imagine that 
intelligent aliens will be humanoid in shape, or something reasonably similar. 
 We have a hard time imagining intelligent beings in shapes *very* different 
than our own.

Then there's the question of how the aliens would likely communicate with each 
other.  Would they vibrate the air, like we do?  Perhaps they would make 
intricate bodily movements and use some kind of sonar to observe each other 
move.  Perhaps they will have ways of communicating massive amounts of 
information in parallel, rather than in a stream, like we do.  Maybe they will 
have developed some sort of technology so that they stimulate each other's 
minds more directly, and their communications would be so subtle that we would 
consider it telepathy.  Their forms of communication may be so profoundly 
different than ours, and their ways of representing knowledge in their minds 
may be so profoundly different, that even if they understand the basic 
properties of the universe to the degree we do and have the same basic 
knowledge, we wouldn't be able to recognize how they've encoded that knowledge 
because we wouldn't understand how they even communicate knowledge to each 
other.  If their knowledge is being communicated between each of the aliens by 
subtle technological links between their minds, then it would be very 
difficult to understand the workings of their communication devices, which 
would most likely be almost seamlessly integrated with their cognitive organs.

Yeah, if they had a periodic chart written down somewhere, then we could 
compare it with ours and understand a little of their language, but what if 
they don't write anything down?  What if all their communication is 
"telepathic"?  How do we crack into their communication systems to even have a 
start at understanding the information that they are passing back and forth?  
And then how do we understand what they're "talking" about?  Maybe each of 
them has all the properties of physical matter memorized, so they no longer 
talk about it; they just refer to that set of knowledge with arbitrary 
symbols.  Then we would never see their scientific knowledge being 
communicated between them, only arbitrary symbols that are meaningful only to 
the aliens themselves.  

To communicate with them, we have to understand the ways they link concepts 
together and what symbols they use to represent which concepts. This is likely 
to be as much of an evolved and tangled mess as human thinking and human 
language.  I don't think we would have much hope of untangling their mess of 
concepts and symbols if we ever met an alien species.

Language is an evolved technological device, with symbols pointing to various 
concepts, which are linked to other concepts with varying degrees of fuzziness 
inside each individual's mind.  Language grows as we invent new symbols to 
point to our shared concepts and develop new fuzzy links between concepts.  
Language grows and evolves very much like an organism.  Minor mutations are 
constantly being made to the symbolic structure.  It's also very much like a 
computer program that keeps getting added to and changed here and there until 
it is almost unrecognizable compared to what it was and is very complex and 
messy.


Michael asks, "Who ever said that humans have a  "low" level of 
communication?"

I did.  It was right in my post.  Did you not see it? :-)

Humans DO have a low level of communication.  Most of the activities and 
thoughts occurring in our brains have no representation in our languages.  We 
can look at the sky, but can we communicate the color blue?  No; we can only 
refer the person we are talking to, to their experience of the color blue.  
When we're communicating with each other, we're basically referring each other 
to common, similar memories and experiences.  We can only really communicate 
about common experiences and concepts.  

Also, it is extremely difficult for us to communicate with each other about 
experiences we have in common but which haven't been talked about before, so 
no symbols have been developed yet to represent that common experience.  
Various bodily sensations and nuances of emotion are common, mutual 
experiences for which we haven't yet developed symbols, and so we cannot 
really communicate with each other about these experiences, because we don't 
know what sounds or images to make to get the other person to remember the 
experience we are wanting to refer them to.

Most of our thoughts have to do mainly with our own specific, individual 
memories and experiencs, and these thoughts cannot be shared through language 
because only the individual thinking them has the proper background (memories) 
to understand those thoughts. 

Do you understand what I am saying?  It's very difficult to communicate these 
ideas well.  Especially since I don't know how much background you have in 
these areas, and I don't know how much to explain and how much to assume you 
already know.  I also don't know how you think about things and link up 
concepts, so I don't know if I'm triggering off your concepts in the proper 
order so that you form the links that I am trying to get you to form with this 
communication.

Effective communication is very difficult to achieve between humans.  It is an 
art that requires much training and practice.

I take it you have something against an intellectual elite.  Aren't 
we all part of one already by having access to computers and the 
internet ?

The government isn't doing this because they want to be kind to the 
cereal, they're doing it so that the cereal _we_ (humans, the 
evolutionary front runners, the top of the food chain) eat is
healthy and won't die from one chance disease.

Because we have evolved to be such flexible organisms, I think we 
have a better chance of surviving a wider range of catastrophes (sp?) 
than do the HTPs.

I see survival as our only goal in this universe.  For the first time 
in the known history of evolution we don't have to worry so much 
about solving our short term survival problems like guessing where 
the next meal is coming from.  We now have the opportunity to start 
solving our problems of 100 years from now.

But the sole drive behind all our activity is still survival.

NO! You just fell into a common psychological trap: if something is said
with confidence and in scientese, it is probably true. That is not a good
heuristic, and quite often used by less than scientific environmentalists
(like Rifkin, who talks about his completely erroneous "fourth law of
thermodynamics"). You should instead demand clarification: "What the ****
is the Bekenstein Bound?!" 

A quick answer: if you accept the uncertainty relations of quantum
mechanics, it follows that you cannot distinguish systems that are similar
enough (Delta x * Delta p >= hbar) using any means. This in turn implies
that you cannot store information as different states if they are too
similar. Now, if you try to store information in a spherical volume with a
finite amount of matter/energy inside, the uncertainty relations tell you
that there is a limit of how many distinguishable states there can be
inside, ergo the amount of information you can store there. This is the
Bekenstein Bound, which says that the amount of information that can be
stored is proportional to the radius and the energy inside the volume (it
is a very loose bound, you can cram several megabytes into a hydrogen atom
and around 10^80 or so bits into the solar system). 

The Minkowsky space part was mostly a hedge to avoid having to deal with 
curved space and all that. It is just plain, flat spacetime according to 
special relativity.

(Fun problem: think of how to circumvent the Bekenstein Bound and get 
infinite information. It is possible in theory)

IRA to IAN: I hope this isn't interpreted as ad hominem abuse, but how does
a statement from Pierre Salinger "prove" that Flight 800 was shot down by a
U.S. Navy missile?  Excuse me if I point out a contradiction in your
analysis: Pierre Salinger works for ABC News.  He is part of the "GovtMedia
news feed."

I am also at a loss to understand how Pierre Salinger, residing in Paris,
has first-hand knowledge when hundreds of investigators off Long Island
still appear to be mystified.

However, if this theory does prove to be true, anyone who publicly
ridiculed your analysis will owe you a public apology.

But there is also still good reason to be skeptical about conspiracy
theories in general and about whether the U.S. Navy shot down Flight 800 in
particular.  More important, Pierre Salinger is an inveterate Statist who
thinks France is a swell place to live; I will always treat his statements
with a good deal of skepticism.


>Hell, ya got to toot your horn a little, particularly after

IRA to IAN: Isn't it a bit premature to proclaim victory?  Wasn't that a
government agent who gave a "document" to a media agent?  Are you sure you
want to bet everything on what a government agent -- whose original source
and motivation remain unknown -- gave to media and ex-government agent
Salinger (Pierre was part of the Kennedy Admin.)?

Perhaps this is a conspiracy by the government to discredit Pierre
Salinger!  If the government could shoot down a passenger airliner and
cover it up, then there is no reason to assume that "shooting down" Pierre
Salinger is beyond the intrigues of the FBI.

But it doesn't seem that likely we remember all input we receive. While
temporal lobe stimulation or hypnosis may give almost hallucinatory
recall, they have been shown to create our elaborations on memories, not
the actual sensory data. 

One dreaming hypothesis I have heard is that we *forget* during the night;
memories are moved into long term memory from short term memory,
presumably based on how important they are, if they can be subsumed into
other memories (this creates retroactive and proactive interference) and
other parameters. This fits in with the fact that we do not forget data we
memorized just before going to sleep as fast as data memorized before
doing something else (study one hour, take a nap, study some more, take a
nap...). 

Uploading in one's sleep is an interesting idea, and might be useful to
get a good base-state to start with. I have always wondered what happens
if you start up an upload with random activation states - probably
something nasty, the mind seem to be a metastable attractor.

Yes, creating a stable environment for uploads is a nontrivial problem. 
We need a large number of processes that interact in a robust, efficient 
way (no, no upload can run as a single process - physics prevents that 
powerful single processor systems, we have to go parallel) that can 
withstand errors, breakdowns and crashes.

For example, assume my brain is run on ten processor clusters and one
crashes (because a nano-squirrel munched up the power cable?). How to
handle it?  One natural solution would be to freeze the other nine
clusters as soon as the error is detected (which takes a short time
compared to my emulated mental processes) while error checking takes place
(was the data sent to the other clusters corrupted before the crash? I
don't want an involuntary digital ECT). Now we need to get the mental
state of one tenth of my mind, either from backup or by backtracking, and
place it on another processor cluster. Clearly nontrivial, especially
since most of us don't want to loose too much of our minds when the lags
on our networks become too much and out internal communications become
asynchronus. 

The above example suggests that fine-grained parallelism is the way to go 
with our minds, we might even be able to stand a few emulated neurons 
crashing.

Actually, this is a very good point. Both as a rehearsal and a way to
start your gradual uploading (I plan to put together my own first system
quite soonish, in fact).

I don't think H accelerans becomes impossible with this scenario, just
different. The brute force HA would just be a human with a mind
accelerated significantly, while a person using advanced ER could have a
myriad search agents, remembrance agents, planners, visualizers and
interfacers running very quickly, feeding him with information and
suggesting what to do. If the user took the plunge, they could even
(assuming sufficient sophistication) act for him, creating a fast, dynamic
exoself where the human is the main core for processing values and
long-term goals (supported by a motivational co-processor?). This is
actually quite similar to how consciousness seem to act: a slow, rather
limited control system that influences the much faster and powerful
unconscious subsystems.

Yes, this may be a serious problem (especially if you have the "wrong" 
views on personal identity; people like me who identify with their memes
and behavior have less trouble with this). If the brain dies/is removed
before enough has been transmitted, we just have a diffuse system with no
motivation or initial memories. What can be transmitted seems to be mainly
memes and what we can encode.

OK, I'll take up this challenge by posting a suggestion that Washington 
DC area Extropians get together soon.  I know that you're out there from 
your email domains, comments in postings, etc.

I don't have any great ideas for an Extropian-oriented event around which 
we can plan, but perhaps it would be a good start, as Max suggests, just 
to meet for dinner.

I encourage those of you in the area to subscribe to the exi-east list 
(if you haven't already done so) and post your suggestions there.

See you soon.

        I think a lot of communication stems from assumption.  Assumption is
a primarily human trait that enables us to make a judgment without hearing a
whole situation.  This realization was quite apparent for me yesterday after
an unfortunate car accident on my behalf.  Anyhow, I believe that assumtion
is one of the biggest flaws of human language.  Once someone makes an
assumption, that assumption will eventually turn into what that person sees
as true.  For example, a person passing by the scene of my accident might
say "He must have been going too fast around that turn." when truly, that is
not the case as all.  That person could go home and tell his\her family
about how someone was "...going too fast down Nash Street".  That is not
effective communication.

        What *is* effective communication is fact-based discussion.  If the
person [mentioned above] who saw my car after the crash was to find out
*exactly* what happened, then he\she could effectively tell his\her
family...or whoever truthfully.  However, if humans were to use fact-based
discussion all the time, there would be a tremendous lack of creativity in
the human race.  We're back where we started.  What exactly is the
definition of 'effective communication'?  Sure, fact-based discussion is
effective...but it gets very boring.  There has to be some sort of
equilibrium between fact and filler.  There must be some way to say what we
want to say while still keeping some sense of 'being human' within our
words.  Any help or enlightenment as to *how* would be appreciated!  :~)

I have something against any one group styling themselves as elite and
entertaining the hubris that they know whats right and best better than
anyone.  If we are deserving to be the elite, then it will happen over
time, as a matter of natural economic and political selection. If you'll
notice the actual issues that were endorsed by both sides in this
election, they typically, with the exception of the drug war, etc. had
their roots in the Libertairian Party. What matters is not that we
become the elite, but that our ideas become the common memes.

This is the psychomystical claptrap. The idea that there is any other
kind of science than science, or other kind of mathermatics than math,
or that another race may have different table of the elements. This is
the sort of stuff you see in tabloids, but not among intelligent people.

If they are technological, they can only do so according to the physical
laws, and even though we may not have discovered them all yet, we still
have enough knowledge to relate pretty closely, at least on our level.
If they were a superior species, they would obviously understand our
limitations and "stoop" to our level of understanding.

If they are technological, they are mor likely to have similar modes of
thinking than not. We have been using technology of various levels since
we got out of the trees, so it has had the most impact on the evolution
of our brains than anything since we got these big things.
 It only follows that a specied that developed technology would have
gone through the same evolutionary process, according to the same
physical laws, and developed similar modes of thinking.

There is only ONE table of the elements, we didn't invent it, we
discovered it, and have only been filling in the blanks.

So far, out of the three or more races here on the planet that should
have the capacity to be intelligent, we are the only ones to develop
technology, so it follows that other technological races would be more
similar to us than say, a dolphin.

How they communicate is not important as WHAT they communicate. If they
are technological, they will be communicating SCIENCE and MATH. We have
experience with many ways of communication, not just sound, including
the electronic form we are using now and we seem to communicate, though
this seems to illustrate the difference between communication between
technological and nontechnological entities. I'm an engineer, your an
artist (?).  Space traveling aliens are likely to be scientists and
engineers, so my argument stands.

Interpretation happens by using concepts that are shared to equate the

Yes I did, show me proof. Based on our limited experience, we are the
best communicating race on this planet, otherwize we would not be able
to organize this huge worldwide and soon interplanetary civilization.

Show me one other species that has done that and I'll concede the point.

There you just did, the sky is blue.

If you were an alien, you would tell me what the wavelength of "blue" is
translated in units measured, probably angstroms, as that is based on
atomic structure, and I would look at that wave length and say HMMMMM
interesting. If we saw in different wavelengths (unlikely for reasons
due to the effects of various radiation on genetic and biological
material) the best we could do is wait until we could graft one of their
types of eyes into one of our people. Using artificianl visual
augmentation, we should be able to "See" in any wavelength.

We all feel the same, and if one romance writer hasn't described about

Thats why we communicate, as a form of relation...

You erroneously assume that every human has as much trouble
communicating their thoughts as you do. This has more to do with
education than evolution.

Sure but once you are there, the same rule pretty much apply to any form

Or a Johnny Mnemonic type dolphin with cybernetic implants to enable them

Sorry to take so long to respond.  I've been sick with shingles.

Yes, if we just assume different people have different beliefs, we
expect those who think its a good idea to tend to be in govt more.
But why should there be such a variation in beliefs?  My model
predicts that most everyone would do as they do in their
circumstances.  

Consider the analogy of explaining war.  Some people think there is a
variation in beliefs about whether war is good, and those nutzos who
think war is good are more likely to be soldiers, and soldiers decide
if we have wars.  I don't consider this a very good theory of war.
I'd rather think in terms of strategic games with asymmetric info.

<Throw this under "what was that about a universal translator, again?">

Aside from the metaphysics, what I was primarily trying to say was that I 
didn't see all that much about "the glory of the Powers" in _A Fire Upon 
the Deep_.  The only Power we see (other than the Blight, which really 
isn't a Power) is Old One.  It cannot descend into the Slow Zone to 
activate the Countermeasure, so It has to reconstruct the human Pham to 
help.  In short, I found that Vinge was saying alot more about the heroics 
of beings at *all* levels than he was about just the Powers.

Damien:
<The concepts stimulated in my mind, which may or may not be what you had 
in mind, is that Vinge's Powers are explicitly somewhat de-mystified.>

Yes, somewhat.

<The Gods don't have strange powers beyond our ken; they're like us, except 
much better.>

I don't think they're necessarily 'better', just adapted to their Zones: 
bio works at the Bottom, comm nets in the Beyond, and who knows what 
substrates they use in the Transcend (see footnotes).

Damien concludes:
<This is what I _liked_ -- the Powers don't manipulate matter through

SF. And I don't see what Countermeasure is more of a crutch than FTL.  It's 
a flexible nano-thingy, which could probably construct jump vanes if 
programmed to.  It does something Zonal instead, befitting an object from 
the High Transcend.>

I liked that too - that the Powers don't manipulate matter through direct 
consciousness.  BUT, I think the Countermeasure is another matter.

Pham Nuwen (from the finale):

Footnotes:
I also mentioned that I thought Vinge's Zones may also have some 'basis' in 
cosmology.  Here are a couple of sticky notes (copied from Science News 
articles) that I found when I was glancing back thru my copy of the book:
7/4/92 MOLECULAR GAS IN THE MILKY WAY: "Researchers have detected molecular 
gas [clouds of carbon monoxide] at the extreme fringes of the Milky Way 
[that] extend along the outskirts ... 100,000 light-years from the galaxy's 
center [and] 1,000 light-years above and below our galaxy's thin disk.  The 
outlying clouds appear much fainter in carbon monoxide [than those near the 
Sun], suggesting they are cold and do not form massive stars."
5/23/92 EXPLORING THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (hmm, I recall some prose from 
somewhere about "explaining ultraviolet to the blind" ;)
"... a type of radiation, rich in information about stellar evolution, that 
occupies a highly ellusive part of the electromagnetic spectrum ... such 
radiation can't penetrate the patchy, tenuous fog of hydrogen atoms that 
fills much of the space between stars."  The point for this discussion 
being that this info-rich radiation might more freely flow on the outskirts 
of the galaxy.

The manipulation and usage of information has many concrete and practical
applications, even if information itself has no physical properties.
Information by definition does not have physical properties.  This is one of
the reasons it can be encoded on virtually any substrate.  

The "Information cannot be moved, only copied" theorem operates under the
assumption that information must be encoded on a substrate to exist.
The theorem basically states that if you have a unique piece of information
encoded on substrate "a", you cannot encode the information on substrate "b"
if the information does not also concurrently exist on "a".  If the unique
piece of information was not encoded on a substrate at the time it was to be
encoded on "b", the information would simply not exist, and therefore be
unencodable.

This is probably the basis for the theorem.  It does directly impact the
development of distributed systems and data replication schemes.  A class on
distributed system theory is where I first came across it.  Data latency is
the mechanism which generates the instance of this theorem in distributed
systems.

If you meet a set of identical twins, they know who is who, even if it is
impossible for you to tell the difference.  No matter how similar they are,
every consciousness has a unique self identity.

It would still be random noise, albeit noise with interesting literary

I thought you were claiming that what we observe, lots of random
looking noise, supports the theory that advanced folks are hiding
around us.  Now I see that you are only claiming evidential
neutrality, that both this theory and its converse would predict the
same observation.   

If so, I will place my objections against the internal consistency of
this theory.  As I elaborated in previous posts, I don't see why some
of these advanced folks would put obvious colonies out at a distance,
so see what sort of reaction they induce.

I think the most nontrivial problem might be to create an environment at 
all capable to sustain an upload... Making it stable is easy in 
comparison (actually, it's simply a side effect of the implementation 
paradigm naturally suggesting itself  ;)

No, not even a single, biologically realistic neuron can be run in 
realtime on a current single-processor machine, however capable. (Just 
ask Joe Strout of MURG, he'll quote chapter & verse).
 
A standard workstation class system (regardless, whether it has or 
hasn't got an FPU) equates to about 100 realtime _simplistic toy_ 
neurons (integer ops, shifts, primitive logics, lots of lookup tables, 
etc.) Whether these toy neurons are equivalent to biologically realistic 
neurons at some abstration level (translation procedure from raw voxel 
data to labeled geometry, then functionality, then reverse-engineering 
the according IAN circuit) is currently unknown (the big IF of uploading, 
since we're up shit creek should we be forced to stick to actual wetware 
geometry & co). The only way increase the size of the simulation is to 
increase memory bandwidth, which means going WSI (wafer scale integration 
of CPU/RAM dies, since on-die accesses are orders of magnitude faster, burn 
less power and don't need bond pads) really soon. Since die yield goes up 
exponentially with die size, and we need a goodish amount of functional 
dies/wafer (let's say at least 50%), this means dies must be small 
(=simple). The smaller, the better.

I don't think uploads will run on von-Neumann machines at all. They will 
require nonalgorithmic virtual hardware, e.g. Integer Automaton Networks 
(a form of ANNs), which will be mapped to extremely braindead molecular 
CAMs (unless strong nanotech proves viable, and we can create complex, 
compact computer 3d-lattice with better OPS/volume/Watt ratio).

Such hardware can't crash (if anybody is interested in mapping IANs to 
molCAM/quantum dot arrays, I can expand on that). Purely digital 
sequential systems should be confined to hybrid use only, everything else 
is much too dangerous.

While IANs do not crash, the hardware might die (molCAMs will slowly 
deteriorate, requiring periodic hardware "upgrades" (which can occur 
transparently incrementally)). However, we harly notice microstrokes, 
even though they mean miniature neuron holocausts (several M of 'em, at 
a guess). So probably no such elaborate exception handling (which might be 
buggy itself, and certainly has negative impact on realtime response, 
which is crucial e.g. in battle) is necessary.  

_Finest_ - grain parallelism is the only option possible.

I am not sure it is an advantage.  It is just a capability of human audio

E. Shaun Russell laments the fact that humans often assume too much that isn't 
based on facts.  And he laments that fact-based discussions are boring.  He 
says, "There has to be some sort of equilibrium between fact and filler.  
There must be some way to say what we want to say while still keeping some 
sense of 'being human' within our words."

I think one way to avoid many of the problems with assumptions is to never 
forget that an assumption is an assumption, based on certain facts that you 
actually experience.  Using the automobile accident example that Shaun brought 
up, the person seeing the crashed cars may reasonably assume that one of them 
was going too fast.  This may or may not be true, so they should remember that 
it is only an assumption, while the fact that they saw crashed cars is a fact. 
 

So when they get home, they can tell their friends, "I saw a couple crashed 
cars downtown.  I think one of them was going too fast, because the other one 
was smashed up really badly and thrown up on the sidewalk.  Or maybe the one 
that got hit, ran the red light and went in front of the other car.  I'm not 
really sure.  But there was glass all over the street and sidewalk, and the 
left side of one car was smashed in really bad, and the front end of the other 
one was all mangled up.  I bet the driver of the car that got hit was killed 
or hurt pretty badly; there were three ambulances there and two firetrucks, 
and the police were still pouring in and starting to direct traffic."

This way, they're stating the facts of what they saw and then stating what 
they're assuming, given those facts.  They've given a lot of facts and 
assumptions, but someone listening knows what they actually saw and what 
they're assuming from that because they use words like "I saw" and "I think" 
and "I bet" and "there was".  It's a matter of training yourself to accurately 
say things.  If you're talking about something you observed, then make it 
clear that it is something you observed, and if you're talking about something 
you are assuming from your observations, make that clear as well.  If you're 
expressing your opinion, make it clear that you're doing that.  And it doesn't 
have to be dry and boring, like my example shows; it just has to be clear to 
the listener what you actually saw and what you are assuming.

I'm reminded of the part in _Stranger in a Strange Land_, by Robert Heinlen, 
where a Fair Witness is asked what color a house in the distance is.  She 
says, "White, on this side."  The Fair Witnesses are trained to observe 
everything very carefully and remember everything fully.  They are very good 
at separating observation from assumption.

As the story is developing, it appears that the documents that 
Salinger has may be nothing more than the document previously 
circulated around the internet. I would be surprised that Salinger
would be so ill informed about the story and about the internet
to assume he had new info.

If that is all he has, well I really overreacted, D'oh !
I expected such an experienced reported as he is would have
known the topic and been very sure of the veracity of the
documentation he is in possession of. Reuters says he got
it from a U.S. Secret Service agent who also "showed him" 
how the Navy hit the plane. 

However, I would note that the internet document in question 
has not been proven false in any way other than the say-so of 
potentially guilty officials -- "we weren't there." Yet initial
reports said the Navy was there at the time.

In fact, when just asked at a press conference earlier today 
if the Navy ever uses the area in question -- which the inter-
net message said is a known test area -- for missile testing, 
Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen, in charge of this case for 
the Navy, said the area below the flight is:

	"Not typicality used for missile training."

When pressed further on this point later on in the conference he said:

	"Not to my knowledge have missiles been fired there."

These are clearly not clear "yes" or "no" answers. Considering 
that this question is KEY to disproving the Internet report, 
and that the Admiral has had weeks to get the story right, 
I find his answers totally unsatisfactory and suspect.

As to Ira's claim to enjoying battling "clueless paranoids" --
i.e., those guilty of the sin of skeptical inquiry regarding 
proven to be false and misleading GovtMedia new feed -- I'd note
that I've presented much evidence of GovtMedia conspiracy and 
have not seen Ira disprove a single feature of any theory. This 
document, listing many such case, was posted here in reply to 
a request to prove that some conspiracies are true:

I'm an engineer too, Mike.  I love designing things and making things and 
studying other people's designs.  I'm sure I don't have as much experience as 
you do yet, since I haven't been working at it as long as I'm guessing you 
have.

I'm also an artist.  I create lots of different forms of expression, using 
lots of different kinds of materials.

I'm also lots of other things. I'm a writer, a musician, a deep thinker, an 
athlete, an actor, a scientist, a mathematician, a technologist, a teacher, 
and many other things.  I enjoy working in many many areas.  In most areas, I 
am only a beginner now, but I am progressing quite rapidly in every field that 
I engage myself in.

I prefer not to limit my intelligence and creativity by using them in only a 
few fields of endeavor.  I want to do many things and excell at everything I

Michael Lorrey wrote to me, "You erroneously assume that every human has as

All my life, I have seen people having a great deal of trouble communicating 
with each other.  I saw it in school, when my fellow students would ask the 
teachers questions, and a great deal of the time, the teacher wouldn't 
understand what they were asking or else think they were asking something 
else, and so they would answer very inadequately, leaving the student baffled. 
 I understood exactly what my fellow students were asking, and I understood 
how the teachers misinterpreted them.  I have seen miscommunication like this 
all my life.  I often act as a mediator between people who are talking to each 
other but can't understand each other, even though they are both fluent 
speakers of English.  One person says something, and the other is baffled, and 
I restate it for them in better terms, and the person they are talking to 
understands.  I'm often saying, "What he's trying to say is..."

I am actually a far better communicator than most humans.  Most humans have 
much more trouble expressing things than I do.  My assumption is not in error. 
 Humans DO have a difficult time communicating with each other, except about 
certain, limited topics.

Effective communication also depends on what you want to communicate. You 
can probably effectively communicate your hunger to most people on the 
planet.

My experience has been that effective listening helps lead to effective 
communication. That and asking questions. Also, as a thought experiment 
listen to yourself and others, and interpret what they say literally. 
This leads to many questions for definition of terms. "What do you mean 
your 'job is driving you crazy?'" "By assumption do you mean 'taking for 
granted?'"
	And, it helps to sometimes ask stupid questions. I have been 
surprised at how much I assumed. Sometimes even the most self-evident 
'facts' (like humans should migrate to space, or dinosaurs once walked 
the earth, or the highway is west of here or, in fact, just about any 
statement using the word 'is'.)
	How, though, do we effectively tele-communicate? >, *, and :-)'s 
all help, but they are far from getting the job done. (Ever notice how 
smiley faces are never written after something really funny? :-> 

Though some of us (perhaps most of us) can't read HTML enhanced text 
within our email, isn't that the way of the future? The simple nuances of 
boldface and italics go a long way to conveying the tone of the users 
voice. (And color, font, layout, sketches, etc.)
	But, of course, this is just email. Any suggestions for other 
fora?
	One last thing. I found the Neuro-Linguistic Programming stuff 
really interesting. Made even moreso by the peculiar life of Bandler.

I really love this.  I too am a Renaissance person.  I recall someone having
said to me as a teenager, "You are doing too much.  Jack of all trades, Ace
of none."  And, I replied, "No. I will be an Ace of many trades!"

David , this is very transhuman.  Be prepared for people 
to be jealous, but we know they are just being 
challenged to do the same.  Hopefully with life
extension more people will feel that kind of pride and boundless optimism in

You're the strangest "anarchist" I've ever seen. Anarchy means no government, 
you may be able to dream up a nice euphemism for it, but what you're 
advocating has the 2 essential ingredients that make a government a government.

1) It claims rights and powers individuals do not have. 

2) At any one time in any one place, only one may exist.

OK, if it's really a business then I can resign from it, and because a 
business doesn't claim any rights that individuals don't have, when that 
"business" informs me that they don't like the way I'm living my life, I can  
just tell them to go soak their head.

Terrific! The consumers can vote for higher quality, lower prices and less 
pollution. The workers can vote for higher wages, more time off, and better  
health care. It's paradise, everybody's happy.

After that they can vote to change the Laws Of Physics and make gravity

I hate to go against the grain, but don't the affirmative cereal action

If you want to spend the time, fine. However a lot of us are either in a
hurry (like me) frantically going through 200 messages at a whack, or
have incompatible readers. Be nice. I also am getting junk email which
is nicely formatted, a sure signal to delete without further viewing. Ye

Let's see now. We have two Caves, each with the shadow of a chair, each
Shadow exactly the same. This leads to some questions:

1. Is it one Cave and two Shadows, or one Shadow and two Caves?
2. If I shoot the chair, does either Shadow remain, and which
    Shadow is the true identity of the chair?
2a. What if I shoot the Cave instead?
3. If I upload the chair, do I need the Cave to see the chair's
    Shadow?
4. If I can't distinguish either Shadow or Cave, where are the
    required Hidden Variables?
5. If I exchange Caves and Shadows, does any Information get
    transferred?
6. Are the tiles on the floor of the Caves done in a Penrose
    design?
7. Is Hemlock an entropian drug?

Facts are only tedious if one keeps putting them together the same way!
Facts can never be boring simply because there is absolutlely no end to
them or the ways they can be arranged. Being extremely concise doesn't make
communication unpleasant, only a rigidity of vision can do that.

Enlightenment may come when assumption is sleeping. If one really wants to
"see" something, put it in a utterly alien context - it's not the thing we
see, but it's juxtapostion or contrast. Every good painter knows that the
stars only come out at night because the sky is dark.

A careless arrangement of facts produces and incorrect assumption, while a
thoughtful arrangemnent may be highly functional and may even be close to
"the knowing the truth."

No, anarchy means no authority. We had industrial laissez faire before,
and more damage was done to people and planet in that brief 100 years than
any time period preceding.

If you really want to get down to it, nobody has any rights. Your vaunted
claim that ownerships is a right is just really just as "invalid" as my
claim that people have the right to have a say in matters that affect
them. Any social system is based on defining what rights which people
have. You take the right of ownership and assign it to everybody, so you
can take it away.  

It has no institutionalized authority. Which I see has having no
government.

Not so. You can have hordes and hordes of them, all over. If you don't
like one, leave, join another, or start your own. Of course, if you run a
repressive one, then nobody will join you as there are egalitarian and
free systems as alternatives.

Yes. You can. What are they going to do about it? But you better figure

Please, do you really have that kind of disrespect for people. I'm sure
people, when given the information, can make reasonable decisions based on
circumstance. When people understand the problems, they will solve them.
While government today hoards it's knowledge and says "we know what's
best", a democratic system depends on everybody having access to the
information. I don't think the consumers will vote for cheaper products if
they realize that the workers can't afford to feed themselves as a
result.

In the November 1 1996 issue of Science is an article about The Scanning 
Probe Microscope. These machines can not only see individual atoms they can 
manipulate them too. The trouble is, a one tip microscope, the only kind made 
up to now, is much too slow to build anything of practical value. Researchers 
reasoned that they could speed things up if they had lots of tips running in 
parallel. Calvin Quate of Stanford University has just made a 16 tip 
microscope and has greatly impressed people with the high quality images it 
produces. Others are working on a 144 tip microscope that should be finished 
soon. 
 
What really struck me is something Quate said at the end of the article, he 
predicted that by this time next year "we'll be writing 1-cm by 1-mm areas 
and we'll be doing it very fast".  On the atomic scale 1-cm by 1-mm is a HUGE 
piece of real-estate! Singularity speculation anyone?

Last night, while fiddling with the VCR, I happened to catch the end of
a "Strange Universe" story about an ape named Oliver.  Oliver is thought
to be a hybrid - genetic tests are being run to identify his parentage.
He looks mostly like a chimpanzee, but he walks fully erect!  
My question: Did anyone catch the whole story, 
and hear where Oliver was found?

I'm in Lebanon, NH, so anyone in New England or Northern New England can
contact me directly for any get togethers. I would suggest to Max that
Extropy have a list of regular time and dates of discussions, like 2600

Yes, one of the root rules with diplomacy is to never assume anything.
You can only go on the facts, and what is explicitly stated.  While
ordinary humans are rather sloppy in their communication, as they prefer
to be lazy with their language, and draw all sorts of perceptions based
on what their own agenda is, diplomats are highly trained in precise 
communication.  Whether they actually use it is another thing. One of
the big problems in diplomacy is the fact that so many political fund
contributors get appointed to ambassadorships without the requisite
training.  In any interstellar mission, I would expect that there would
be a team of people trained in sociology, diplomacy, semantics, etc. on
board in case of just such an encounter. Anyone who makes it to space is
also more likely to be highly educated versus the average bloke. This is
unlike the adventurers during the age of discovery like Columbus,
Cortez, etc. who were more interested in wealth than communication, and
were typically illiterate as well.

Never mind, I got an answer.  Oliver the ape

was displayed for some years as a circus freak.

Very good, David. I was wondering when somebody else was going to think
of that. This is the one real failing in human communication, and has
nothing to do with language or our ability to communicate. It has much
more to do with our reliance on inference as a crutch to substitute for
true concentrated observation.

Good for you. I also try to follow Heinlein's definition of what a true

WHile developing FTL capability would be GREAT, we must make plans on
what is practical, based on extrapolation from _known_ information.

Anders: Considering that actually going light speed IS impossible,
unless we are mere software riding a laserbeam to a reciever on another
planet, we will be a little more restrained than just the light locus.
Assuming an average 20 light years in our local area between habitable
earthlike worlds (not really neccessary, but a good motivator for the
majority of mere humans), and a requirement to only accelerate and
decellerate at 1 G, the average jump of colonization expansion will take
approximately 22 years, or an average rate of 0.9 C.  THen assuming that
we have a virgin world on the other end, a certain logistical base would
need to be built before the next jump could be attempted. If one has a
significant base of automatons, even nontech, one could concievably send
an automaton scouting party ahead at higher accelerations to prep a
base, which would decrease the lag time between jumps. If up-minds
wished to beam out to the new colony, there would also be a drag on
further expansion by the need to build capacity for the influx of
upminds. This would be a good problem to develop an algorithm for,
possibly another video game, Conquer the Universe or some such.

But that would be reverse discrimination! Corn flakes can't help it if

I know exactly how you feel. But don't assume that teachers are
excellent communicators.  I'll have you know that here in the US, the
average SAT score of teachers is the very lowest of ANY profession
requiring a bachelors degree. There are very few teachers I have known
that were in my mind capable communicators.

But you are still assuming that ALL humans are bad  communicators. It is
more a matter of laziness and ignorance than lack of brain matter.

What do you mean, the Powers can't operate at our level except through
us?  Vinge's A Fire Upon The Deep is *fiction*.  That's all.  Vinge can
no more write a realistic Power than an amoeba can write a realistic
human.  A genuine Power wouldn't be stopped by the Zones, wouldn't be
taken unaware by the Blight, wouldn't fade out after ten years, would be
able to deduce what Countermeasure was and where to find it without even
trying, and would see as obvious enough physics to rewrite the Zones any
time it wanted to.

The most unrealistic part of A Fire Upon The Deep wasn't the Zones.  To
paraphrase Douglas Adams, the Zones just presume there's something in
the Universe we don't know about, and God knows there are enough of
those.  The unrealistic part is Vinge claiming that there's something
the Powers don't know about.  That's just ridiculous, wildly impossible,
and the sole justification for it is that the novel required it.

The Powers, our future selves, will be smarter than we are.  They will
be able to do anything we can and a hell of a lot more.  There is
nothing they will forget that we know, no problem we can solve that they
can't.  Don't forget that.  Most of the discussion on this list is
absolutely ridiculous because we're discussing problems that will be
solved in instants by beings beyond our imagination.  Our sole
responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are; any problems
beyond that are not ours to solve.

Also, I doubt the Zones are a metaphor for anything.

This strikes me as the key to the debate, and to others I've read on this
list.  Various posters have denounced measures grounded in tenets of
mutuality by gesturing to the horrid consequences: you build your house,
say, and all the other lazy bastards take it from you, announcing that their
need is as great as yours and since their numbers are greater than yours
they win the moral right of use.  

I've never grasped why anyone thinks people are likely to behave this way as
a rule.  Yes, small embittered cohorts that have been excluded from the
benefits of an industrial culture - let us say out of  a history of bigoted
racism - surely do wave guns and menace their neighbors, destroy their
brains with intoxicants that numb their despair, lose the habits of
sociality (but not necessarily of honor and respect, in a narrow sense based
on balance of immediate terror).  

I find it interesting that this construction of others as malevolent, lazy,
stupid (or rat-cunning) tends to be more wide-spread in societies where
extremes of capitalism *or* state socialism have taken hold.  In many
European countries, and Canada and Australia, where a shifting blend of
these approaches operates, there is less street violence, far less
polarisation of rich and poor and hence of envy and fear (although that is
changing, and I exclude the usual brutal marginalisation of indigenes in the
latter two nations).  

In general, I expect people to help each other unless there is an
overwhelming motive for not doing so.  Unlike most people on the net, I'm a
complete klutz with computers - and would not be here, were it not for
various people who simply chose to be generous and help me out.  In return,
but not with any strict accounting being recorded, I do what I can to help
other people in areas that pertain to my skills.  
As a science fiction writer, all my adult life I've been part of a global
(if Anglo-centric) community of people called sf fans whose entire
weltanschaaung is based on what amounts to potlatching.  As less and less
jobs remain in a rapidly approaching (AI- and nano-modified) future, this
seems to me the pattern for decent human relationships.  We might not always
be able to love each other, but we certainly won't get far if we assume that
everyone else is out to scam our hard-won goodies.

Having registered my own pious plea, above, I now have to say that Suresh's
hope is empirically doubtful.  In my country, most consumers have achieved a
much more pleasant standard of living by importing huge amounts of very
cheap consumables from the sweatshops of south Asia, thereby effectively
wiping out the small industries that used to produce clothing, light
electrical goods, etc.  In the long run, of course, nanofacturing will do
this on a mammoth scale - but with any luck the goodies flowing from the
cornucopia machine will be *so* cheap that everyone will gain by their
existence.  Right now, the inner city industrial suburb where I live is full
of empty factories, and 30 percent of the kids who once would have had a
fairly nasty life working in them are cooling their heels at home all day
long, on the dole but chafing for a meaningful life.  But the consumers (at
least 50 percent of them, since voting is compulsory and therefore universal
in Australia) keep voting in the pollies who ordain the `level playing
field' doctrines responsible for the ruin of their neighbors.

        Too true.  I'm guilty of not explaining *exactly* what I meant by
fact-based discussion.  I *should* have defined it as 'discussion that is
totally factual with no amount of information that is not proven.'  This
would get very boring very fast.  When one adds a little bit of modifying
language to the fact-based discussion, it has a tendency to get more
interesting while still conveying the facts.

        I agree wholeheartedly.

>PS: Who had the car accident on your behalf?

        Actually it was just myself...no other cars involved.  It was
raining quite hard when it happened and I must have been going a little bit
too fast for the conditions.  As I approached a stop sign, my brakes locked
and I had to turn the steering wheel as hard as I could, lest I enter a busy
intersection.  The back end broke loose and I skidded into the front yard of
a house, thus lodging the car on a small concrete retaining wall.
Surprisingly enough, the only damage to my car (an Omega...can you imagine
anything else?) was that one of my tires came off of the rim.  There was
also a little bit of damage to my car's undercarriage, but nothing major;
the retaining wall is another story...

Subjective Consciousness is undetectable as yet but we know it exists though

Enhanced or Augmented Reality is probably where we will create and prefect
the ultimate tools for ultimate productivity on the bio platform before we
transcend.
I am beginning to become more and more convinced that we will migrate to

Wouldn't it be neat if we are able to extract any genetic information about
these organisms to recreate them? I wonder what the consequences of them
entering into the environment would be. Probably not much due to the fact
that we have bigger badder organisms here ready to take them out. Disaster
is even less probable if Earth life rode a rock from Mars to get here
because then it would be more compatable to be killed off by earth life.

Take it beyond this. Perhaps we will not be able to upload to silicon very
well. Perhaps we'll need to create better and better combination
bio/silicon brain structures and nano transplant your brain into the mass
to grow into the new brain structure like bone grows into coral. We all
know that bio doesn't crunch numbers well and silicon doesn't parallel
process as well as bio does so we need a centrist view of the optimal brain
habitat and structure. Merging the best of both.

Whoa! Dolphins wired to the web. Cool. I wonder what special mental
processes they could evolve to add to our pool of knowledge. We *ARE*
Gaia's brain (to go along w/the analogy) and what you're suggesting is that
we should wire all animal brain's to the global internet brain to speed up
evolution of all the animals. A bit odd but cool. The shared global sum of
Earth's knowledge.

No one can know the entire english vocabulary and there are emotions still
undefined by english so no one can communicate in the least amount of words
and time possible unless you're uploaded and have thousands of years to
restructure your sentences.

Our current language is like how computers across the internet talk to each

think that we will migrate toward a more visual-based language such as
highly detailed stories but created quickly with tools to relay alot of
information to another individual.

Perhaps we need to become a closer more open society with people openly
sharing their ideas. This could be encouraged though dynamic optimism being
taught in preschools.

Wow.  You must have a chip on your shoulder, Mike.  I have spent 
quite a bit of my life in public schools and public libraries, and I was 
always treated like a human being.  I haven't had much occasion to use 
other government facilities, except post offices.  I hate going to the 
post office, it's a zoo, but if I am friendly to the clerks, they are usually 
friendly to me.  I have also been treated in a friendly manner by the 
staff in public parks, swimming pools, etc.  

I have run into a certain amount of rudeness, but very little of it 
was in government facilities.

An interesting idea indeed.  People think, at least partly, in the
language that they use to communicate.  But unfortunately, language
is created primarily for communication between individuals, not for
managing ideas within an individual's own mind.   I suspect that it
is possible to improve intelligence by creating a language that
better facilitates thinking.  Just as you've suggested, such a
language could be oriented more towards visualization rather than
the usual serial stream of sounds or written symbols.  The "grammar"
of such a language could provide for language constructs of two or
more dimensions.  It could also be used for communication, just like
any other language, but would be conveyed as 2d graphics, or even 3d
models.  It should probably have no spoken counterpart since that
would difficult to reconcile with its non-linear nature, and would
likely be detrimental to the mode of thinking that it is intended to
facilitate. 

I think that the development and experimental use of such a language 
would be a fascinating endeavor.

Funny that you claim the mantle of "skeptical inquiry."  I remain skeptical
about the Navy missile theory.  I don't think the issue is whether one of
us is skeptical and the other is not, I think the issue is what each of us
thinks is a proper target of skepticism.

While the world is brimming with liars and thieves, I remain dynamically
optimistic that the truth meme is very powerful.  In the days before
electronic media, the truth sometimes took centuries to finally assert
itself.  Now, thanks to technological progress, the truth can travel just
as fast -- if not faster -- than falsehood.

While you and others spread the Navy missile story over the Internet, the
news media (for all its faults) spreads reports via broadband fiber and
satellite links of Salinger holding crumbled papers that he refuses to let
anyone examine.
While Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen left the door open a crack -- properly
so, as he making statements based on what his staff tells him -- it is now
clear that Salinger is the intellectually dishonest scoundrel that (ahem) I
suspected.

But in fairness, you deserve credit for backing off on Salinger.  I don't
mean that in anything but a positive sense.  Most "clueless paranoids" are
unable to back off on anything, instead building a case that becomes
increasingly convoluted over time.  (I know this from countless hours
battling them.)

I suggest the following scale:

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...... rude and deceitful
STATE GOVERNMENT........ lazy and slow to respond
LOCAL GOVERNMENT........ bureaucratic, polite, and mildly responsive if you
don't ask too much

Of course, you may occasionally run into someone new and idealistic.

Regarding the post office, what you are really saying is that if you only
request routine services, but act all the while as if they are performing
valorous deeds, they will respond positively -- in customary slow motion.

In general, employees of local government know they must be more courteous
because their jobs are rarely guaranteed for life, they must often deal
with the same people repeatedly, and they know there could be future
ramifications (e.g., they may discover the victim of their rudeness is, or
becomes, a person of authority).

I think Michael was trying to illustrate that government employees are much
less responsive than company (i.e., free market) employees.  Lack of
friendliness is not the real issue, however, but merely a symptom.
Personally, I avoid State and Federal employees as much as possible.  When
forced to deal with them -- usually because no alternative is *permitted*
-- I would much prefer they scowl at me while doing as I request in a
prompt and competent manner.

Of course, some of them have discovered a friendly countenance is
sufficient to win effusive praise from Statists.

IAN: Of course, as facts prove, you require ad hominem to 
bolster your case, I'll try to stick with facts and logic. I 
realize there's a degree of "joshing" here, but only a degree.

 > Funny that you claim the mantle of "skeptical inquiry."  

IAN: So you suggest that questioning the govt and the media, which 
mindlessly relays the govt's news feed, is not skeptical inquiry? Perhaps
proper skepticism is to be directed only at those who question authority.

 > I remain skeptical about the Navy missile theory.  

IAN: So do I, but I think evidence weighs strongly in that direction, 
mostly toward a missile. My chief concern here is why the Navy is so 
quickly exonerated. I'd like to encourage people to question authority,
which means don't simply believe everything authoritarian figures say.
Rather than encouraging that, you smear such primary skepticism as
mental illness, that's a vicious aggression against skeptical inquiry.

I've never said "the Navy did it." I believe 90% a missile did it.

IAN: Agreed. I question authority, it seems you mostly question 
those who question authority, which is fine, so long as we don't 
resort to the nonlogical method of ad hominem.

IAN: He's a scoundrel because he has documents the GovtMedia does not 
like?? Forget the fact that these documents, if they are nothing more 
than the internet document, have not, to my knwoledge, been disproven 
in any fashion other than that they were anonymous and that the USN 
says, "we weren't there." If the authorities say X is true, then X 
is true and anyone who says otherwise is an "intellectually dis-
honest scoundrel." I reject that thinking as servile.

Where's your proof that the internet document is false? I just, in the 
last post, presented evidence that the key feature of disproving it, 
that area W-105 is not a missile testing area, is compromised by the 
USN dude saying the area is "not typically used for missile training."
That does not prove the Navy did it, but it leaves the door open on
the validity of the document. So where's your assumed disproof?

I assume you're talking about the 19'th century, and it's true, life was

as they were before the 19'th century, not as they are now. Never before in

If there is no institutionalized authority who runs the elections? You don't 
believe in managers so people will need to vote about every 10 minutes. 
Who stops the black market? If your factory votes to sell its product for $10, 
and another factory a thousand miles away votes to sell the same thing for $5,  
you're going to need another institution, in this case storm troopers, 
to stop me from buying from them.

And that is exactly why what you're proposing is a government, it's not 
enough that I quit, I must leave. In a true anarchy if I want to change from 
one PPA to another, all I have to do is pick up a phone, tell the new PPA my 
credit  card number for the premium, and that's it. I don't have to move 
anywhere.

I like people, some of my best friends are people, but I do have that kind of  
disrespect, contempt might be a better word, for elections. The workers can  
vote to give themselves any wage they please, but the idea that they will  
actually receive such a wage sounds like something out of Monty Python.  
If the factory doesn't have the money it can't pay the wages regardless of 
the vote. End of story.
                

                >I don't think the consumers will vote for cheaper products

                >themselves as a result.  
                

You are acting like it's obvious that the more a factory charges for its 
product the more money the factory will make and so the more it can pay its 
workers. You are acting like there is a simple relationship between the price 
of an object and the total amount of money made by the manufacturer.  
You are profoundly wrong.   
                   
What price of a product would maximize profits and thus benefit the workers 
the most? I haven't the slightest idea. The ideal price is determined by 
trillions of factors interacting in hideously complex ways, the human mind is 
far too puny a device to figure it out from first principles, the idea that 
you could obtain this enormously valuable information from an election, the  
same process that placed our current crop of Bozos in power, is utterly  
ridiculous. Fortunately we don't need to calculate it, the market will 
quickly  let us know if we are very far from that ideal price.

  IAN: I'd have to say that anarchy cannot 
  mean "no govt" or "no authority."  If so 
  then the only place there is anarchy are 
  uninhabited places.

  I'd say that anarchy is maximized where 
  self-govt and self-authority is maximized.

  I don't see that corporations reduce my
  self-govt, in fact, by producing useful
  products, they maximize my self-govt,
  and through mass production, seek to 
  maximize the self-govt of the masses.

  I believe that for the most part, govts
  reduce my self-govt by removing my rights
  to earn a living, buy, sell and behave as
  I choose, where such does not prevent by
  coercion others from doing the same.

Ira Brodsky looks behind the curtain and says to me, "Ah ha!  So *you* are the 
AI. <g>"

I'm proud to proclaim that I am indeed artificially intelligent.  The 
intelligence I am currently using is the result of tremendous amounts of 
mental training that I have undergone.  Most of my intelligence is my own 
creation, and a lot of it is from other people who have taught me and from 
studying other people's work.  

If something is artificial, that means it is an artifact, created by humans.  
It does not mean "less than real" or "inferior", as many interpret it.  
Everything consciously created is, by definition, "artificial".  

My intelligence is almost entirely my own creation and the creation of other 
humans whom I have learned from.  The basic "hardware" was provided by 
evolution, but the brilliant intelligence was something created by myself and 
other humans, and thus is "artificial".

The more we direct our growth, the more artificial and self-created we become. 
 I am proud to be artificially intelligent, and I am working dilligently on 
becoming even more so.

No.  If I go to up to a window at the post office, and say  "Hi, I need to 
send this package first class," the clerk weighs the package, takes 
my money, puts the sticker on the package, and wishes me a good day, 
just like the clerks at UPS offices.  

As far as I recall, there has been only one exception to this.  At the 
on-campus post office at Stanford, they had some rude clerks; 
one in particular was notoriously surly.  On the other hand there were  
some surly people in private businesses in Palo Alto in those days, 
too.   And since then I have run into some UPS clerks who were 
pretty abrupt.  

Since last night I have been trying to remember if I have ever had any 
experience with the federal government.  Very little.  In high school 
I went to a summer course for gifted math students, sponsored by NSF.  
Years later, I got an evaluation form in the mail, asking about whether 
the course had been useful to me.  The form had a threat attached:  
either fill out this form, or you will never get any funding from NSF.  
As it turned out, I have never applied for an NSF grant, so I don't know 
if they were bluffing.  They were certainly rude.  (I think I filled out 
the form anyway, since the course was a very positive experience and 
I wanted them to continue offering such courses.)  

For every example of rudeness by government employees, I can 
think of a dozen examples of rudeness by employees (or owners) of 
businesses, including small businesses.  

What I am "really saying" is 
1.  If you have NEVER been treated like a human being, then you are 
    bringing this on yourself.  If you treat other people like human beings, 
    they will usually reciprocate.   
2.  You are trying to make your perceptions fit your ideology.  I am just 
    trying to remember what has happened to me, and in my experience 
    rudeness has been a random phenomenon -- it is no more common 
    among government employees than anywhere else.

        I could almost wipe a tear from my eye if I didn't already know 
this myself.  This is one of (if not *the*) most uplifting posts I have 
seen in my months on this list.  It takes the vast majority of humankind 
many years to figure this out.  Most people *never* figure this out.  The
sad part (let me lament a little here) is that it is such a simple meme.
People should grow up with this knowledge...know it instinctively.  We 
create ourselves.  We *create*.  We are all artists.  We are all art.  We
*are*.  It is so tremendously important for the future of mankind; to 
attain progress, we must create.  Gandhi had a phrase (also someone's
signature, and a line in one of my poems) that said "You must be the
change you wish to see in the world."  As everyone on this list should
know, those words are ultimately true.  *We* know that, now the next step
is to show that to others.  Again, kudos to David for an excellent post!

This is not my experience, although i am aware of 
what you mean.  I think that in every situation it is
fairly true that how you treat others has a lot to do
with the way you are treated. I have been dealing with
state agencies lately and they have been so courteous
and helpful _ and they dont have to be, it was the 
INDIVIDUAL personality that made them that way.

I see that you may be saying that govt. jobs may not 
encourage people to do their solid best, but that could
be stated without "dehumanizing" every worker that 
works for the state. Look, job to job,  people are people. 
There are shitty people working for many kinds of
companies, not just govt. ones. Ever talk to MSN?
 
But everyone in the USA knows about the NOTORIOUS 
slowness and insolence at post office and DMV, so i 
understand what you are getting at.  Even at those
 places I have been treated well, and it is the exception
 to the rule, i am sure. But I am awfully courteous and respectful myself,
and i love people. You get what you
give. You give love, you get love, etc.
Your  point was a valid one: if people are forced to 
buy from you - you dont have to be competent. We need a
change.
But lets not replace old memes with more negativity, hatred and inhumanity.

While I agree with you that any mere human would not bea able to
accurately convey the representation of a true POWER in his books, as we
have never even seen one, and most of what they do wuld be unfathomable
in any case. However, I greately dissagree with your contention that
they would be as godlike as you claim. Any intelligence wishing to
retain existence in this universe will have to obey the laws of this
universe, even if they use what seem like loopholes like FTL, etc, they
would still be part of the laws. 

And ANY intelligence can only make evaluations based on information
available that is known to be true, or known to be false. As we see in
the current internet, there is a high level of disinformation out there,
of varying levels of truthfulness; the situation would be no different
on a galactic level, probably even worse. Any information that you don't
know to be true or false is basically worthless, while mixed value is
even worse. _AFUTD_ was I think rather representative as to what we at
our current level could possibly understand about such events. The fact
that "mere" humans outmaneuvered a great power had more to do with being
in person as opposed to acting by proxy,  plus the fact that they had
their own help from a great power.

In the end, even Vinge himself admits that the only reason he created
the concept of the Zones was because he (accurately) forsees humanity
transcending rather rapidly within the next 50 years or so, which leaves
a very small window of opportunity to get enough humans into
interstellar space to be around in events written to be over 50,000
years in our future. He needed a gimmick to prevent us from
transcending  too soon.

I did hear that the FBI examined Salinger's papers, and announced that
they were the same one's publihsed over the internet which were
"discounted" already in the investigation.

Question: If they were discounted, why did a Secret Service Agent give
these to him now, when they are apparently worthless. Perhaps they were
not and this person was trying to get some one who had experience in the
WHite House operations to see that maybe they were not fake. I would
like to see an invenstigation of the investigation. 

If you recall, this is the same thing the FBI said about the "shoot to
kill" orders they gave agents at Ruby Ridge. The truth eventually came
out in the end there, and showed that the FBI is a lying pack of dogs.

This is rather accurate, though the slime has seemed to ooze downhill a
lot since I was a kid. When I was little, the postman who walked the
route was a freindly guy, so there is one exception.

I think that the reason Lyle said what he did, is that he either lives
in one of those fairy land type countries, or he lives in an area where
everyone is equally rude, so the rudeness of gov't employees seems
rather normal. (BTW Lyle, do you live in New York?)

I read an article in the paper recently on how northerners here in the
US, typically from MA, NY, NJ, Chicago, and such, have an extremely hard
time adjusting to the politeness and freindliness that many southerners
naturally effuse. They think that if they are not being treated like
shit that someone is trying to get something from them, or that they are
wierd somehow.

I have been considering this thought which is throughout the animal kingdom
males have more beauty and special characteristics and the females are the
boring looking type so why has this situation reversed with humans? and
what caused it? or is it only my perception? If you look at the male and
female human form, females are more elegant and graceful. Men appear bland
and boring and not that graceful at all. Is it due to the fact that I'm
looking at it from the first person perspective rather than from a third
person perspective where I would consider things differently if I were
another type of intelligent animal looking at the human form? Am I the only
one who shares this view?

I have been considering this thought myself and am awestruck! I'll give it
to 2002. Give 'em a few years to ponder over the perfect nanite design. I
told my christian memetically infected brother and he said "Oh great, the
end of the world in just a few years!". Once nano hits the streets, prepare
to REPROGRAM THE WORLD!! Muhahahahaha! Imagine a perfectly clean house all
the time! or watching a building built quickly as if you were watching it
being rendered on a CAD machine with a wire frame going up first which is
then covered layer by layer of material. Cool!

This is a really exciting time people! WE ARE DOING MORE IN A SINGLE DECADE

Well, now that we all know that there is interest in this idea, perhaps we
need a linguist to help us in constructing one and I know there MUST be a
linguist on the list here. Also with enhanced reality it we may be able to
communicate more effectively by merely playing back a video clip of an
event in your life to the other person so they can see for themselves. In a
visual based language we should assign multiple meanings for each human
sense to a specific 3D model. This allows us more flexibility with less
characters but more information being communicated. To universalize these
characters we could link to them with urls so that the same image is
retrieved from a central source so that we can universalize the characters
and so that multiple dialects don't arise. In a line I read from snow
crash, languages seem to break apart into multiple dialects rather than
unify, so it's best to centralize the language but allow for unlimited
character combinations and voting on new character types so allow evolution
and flexibility of the language.

David Pearce's pages are wild!

Mike's post reminds me of the distinction is between particular emotions
and "emotion" in general.

I think talking about emotions in general, the *facility* of emotion,
the emotional aspect of mind, as vestigial, is wrong.  Sometimes people
talk about emotions as if they were interfering outside influences, and
that amounts to the same thing.  Not recognizing them as parts of
oneself.

To me it's like talk of "surgical" warfare.  I'm afraid that
people who use clinical terms to talk about something violent...are on
the wrong side of the war.  The jargon of "self-enhancement" can be
used in this way, often unconsciously; but any talk of oneself as an
object to be manipulated must be coming from some *part* of the self
considering itself *above* the rest--such a part must be misspoken at
best, misinformed, misguided, insensitive, inhumane, or even evil.

*Particular* emotions can be considered "vestigial".  I have a whole
flock of emotions that I consider nasty enemies, things to be
controlled, managed, etc., although in some sense they may have things
to tell me.  But also I realize that "me" is just one side in a war of
some emotions against others, or even emotions turned against themselves
in the dark.

I don't begrudge anyone a metaphor that helps them to cope.  The danger
is letting the old-fashioned false mind/body-dualistic way of talking
trick you into an undeclared war on your own best self.

There are some implications for the "play dirt" strategy: first of all, you
have to be invulnerable to any sort of attack, both by redundancy and
rerouting, and also in the sense of not revealing anything when stressed.
Sounds like we haven't achieved anything like the latter--current
cryptosystems seem to spill the beans under torture.

Second, the way the technology of cryptology evolves in our world today
is by constant attempts to defeat what has gone before.  If this were
simply institutionalized--with testing on live subjects, as it were--it
would provide a way to simultaneously improve one's weapons, seek out and
attack enemies or prey, and enforce the "lie low" rule.  Just constantly
shoot bullets over everyone's heads.  Of course, you keep backups, don't
you?

If he means by distinguishing superposed electronic
states of a hydrogen atom (or molecule), that is a
_very_ tall order. Proximity effects from other atoms
will also disturb the system, limiting the volumetric 
efficiency at the macroscopic scale.
Or is the state space of the entire system read/written to?
If so, thrre is a problem in determining the boundaries 
of the system.


If the method involves degenerate states (i.e. neutronium)
of matter, then perhaps...

One example is Loglan.  There was an article about Loglan in 
Scientific American about 1966, and later there was a book about it.  
I don't think it was ever actually used.  

It is interesting to note that Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Gauss, and 
Riemann all wrote in Latin.  Riemann was writing in Latin as recently 
as the 1860's.

The sort of uploading that interests me, would be to keep my body
but use nanotech to improve and augment.

Could each neuron be rebuilt to run faster ?
And store huge libraries and complex programs built into my skull,
collar bone or pelvis ?
Nano-bots reparing cell damage ?

Im a busking songwriting banjo player, i'd love to be able to call
up a songs' score, and be able to hold thousands of songs in my head.
To have the tools that i have on my PC intuitively accessable inside
my own head would be great.

I love being a human, and have no desire to upload myself just upgrade.

i agree with Steve, Sex and Death are two basic mechanisms of evolution.
Whether Technological/Cultural evolution will not need them, or whether
it'll use them in it's own way is an open question.  I suspect that 
the evolutionary strategy has good efficient reasons for them.
Afterall, all life has sex and dies, (with the exception, maybe, of
bactaria and virii ).

Sex is also in human terms, a form of communication, reassurrance, bonding,
recreation, pleasure and sometimes power.

Im new to this mailing group, ive read and i like a lot of the basic 
books that extropians recommend.   I find it a bit sad that such obviously
intelligent people seem to have a blind spot regarding the complexity
and sophistication of day to day human relationships.

It seems to me that some people here want to become not so much Transhuman
as non-human.

Some unrelated thoughts:
* This does not occur "throughout the animal kingdom" -- it's just fairly
common, and we notice the cases that conform.

* Human females don't have to hide themselves and their young from predators
the way other animals do.

* The point is to attract attention.  Since humans have forebrains, males
can attract attention by being witty or rich rather than attractive.
Nice clothes, fast cars, and wizzy tech toys can also take the place
of plumage.

* Taller males are generally considered more attractive (I'm speaking
statistically here); so are stronger ones.  Hairiness goes in and out.
These are forms of natural human "plumage".

* Human females have forebrains, too, and they don't go into heat and become
primally irresistible for a week per year, and they may well want sex when
nobody's paying attention, so they've developed sophisticated strategies
for getting the attention of the most desirable males.

* Males in aboriginal cultures wear feathers, beads, warpaint, or whatever,
and probably gain more physical proficiency than American males from
having to do things like tribal dancing, stalking prey, etc., thus
conforming more to your norm.

* An alien looking down would probably not see much difference, from a
biological standpoint.

* Your "first person perspective" has "hetero male" written all over it.
A gay male (or anyone attracted to males sexually) might beg to differ.

* Mikhail Barishnikov and Gary Hines are both very graceful, thanks.

Good post K, you covered a lot. 
I think men are far more beautiful than women, 
personally. They have facial hair, musculature, 
grace and stature... We are simply inundated with
male dominated advertising, literally bombarded 
with thousands of pretty girls so we have become 
brainwashed to think it is the thing we must adulate.

An artist friend of mine complained about having to
look at so many pretty girls til he felt they were 
becoming devalued, he said
"look, if we were told WARTS were beautiful 
ten thousand times we would believe it."

I think men are more physically alluring, but they 
sure have decided to dress in drab clothing, maybe 
it is fear.

Maybe it's just that I'm so truculent that other people seem nice by 
comparison.  ;-)

No, I live (most of the time) in California, that fairy-land country 
by the sea.  I've spent some time in New York.  It has its own kind of 
rudeness.  But I've been treated worse in Austin, Boulder, and Reno.  

I think we are dealing in cliches and stereotypes here.  I'm trying to 
get away from that.  Texas has its own kind of rudeness, so does the 
northwest, so does California.  And many New Yorkers are surprisingly 
nice.

There is probably some truth to this.  My relatives live in Arkansas and 
Louisiana, so that area is my second home.  Southerners are friendly, 
no doubt about it.  But I have been to Chicago a couple of times in the 
last few years, and found that the people there (the white people, at 
least) were also very friendly.  In fact I was a bit uncomfortable, being 
among friendly midwesterners with my standoffish west-coast habits.  
(I also felt like I was going from a third-world city to a first-world city, 
but that's another story.)  

Coming back to the original point:  You were saying that there is a 
causal relationship between (a) the fact that government agencies don't 
need to create happy customers, and (b) the level of rudeness in those 
agencies.  If people were rational, this causal relationship would exist, 
but in fact (in my experience at least) it doesn't exist.  I have found 
just as much rudeness, if not more, in department stores, drug stores, 
restaurants, and other businesses, even though they can't afford to lose 
customers.  It is a mistake to assume that people are more rational than 
they are.

The connection between language and thinking is a lot stronger than 
most people suspect.  

What worries (and inspires) me 
the most about language is that it's 
basic nature hasn't changed in thousands
 of years, we still link idea 
packages (words) to each other in a 
linear fashion.

                                        After all language is our 
                                        primary popular method for 
                                        abstracting reality (ignoring 
                                        for a moment specialist 
                                        languages like maths).  

Another huge leap in improving 
communication will happen when 
we start using VR technology as a 
comm. tool by writing in 3D.

                                        This is mainly due to our

                                        look like, by adding more 
                                        dimensions.

I am not aware of any existing language experiments of this nature.  
But that may just be due to my own ignorance since i am not a 
linguist.

I do, however, have quite a few ideas of my own on this subject.  I've 
toyed with this "thought language" concept for many years.

Perhaps some of us should get together to create something.  If 
successful, it would be a way to become something better in the near 
term, while still persuing more long term improvements.  A very 
transhumanist endeavor.

When I was in high school, I formulated the crude beginnings of such
a language.  The language was represented in two dimentions, and
thus could be shown on paper.  Objects (ideas) were represented by
strings of symbols, just like any other modern human languages.  But
the relationships between those ideas was, for the most part,
represented graphically, by means of different sizes, relative
positioning of the objects, and linking symbols.  A very prominent
relationship was "containment", which was shown simply by drawing  a
closed figure associated with each object. This closed figure would
then contain other objects that contribute to it, which could in turn
contain still more objects.  An object representing the actor, might
contain the act, which might in turn contain the thing acted upon. 
A graphical symbol might then link this to another set of nested
objects describing the state of affairs that proceeded as a result
of the actor's actions.  This structure would imply that the main 
idea being expressed is that this particular actor is responsible for 
some resulting state of affairs.  The rest is finer detail.  It could 
be structured very differently if the main concern were the way in 
which all of this had affected the object that was acted upon.

My reasoning for having a hierarchical (or layered)  structure like this
is that a single document could then be "read" at varying levels of
detail and still be meaningful.

For example, a quick glance at a document describing a computer
might reveal the outermost "layer" of the description, which might be 
simply a symbol that represents the idea "computer" (very much like 
the function that the word "computer" serves in English).  This then 
would contain other objects representing various aspects of a 
computer, such as software, hardware, history, etc.  These would then 
contain further detail describing programming languages, busses, 
logic gates, transistors, electrochemistry, etc.

This kind of structure could be greatly facilitated by using
computers.  A "reader" could literally zoom in to get a more detailed
understanding of something, or zoom out to see the "big picture".

Sorry for that, it was partially a slip of my mind, in two ways: first, as
Mitch Porter pointed out, the Bekenstein Bound is just an upper limit,
there may be lower bounds to information. And secondly, we have no
instrumental knowledge of how to do it, just the theoretical possibility. 
Seems I was a bit too boundlessly optimistic in that sentence... :-)

Chris Hind is wondering why women appear so elegant and beautiful to him while 
men appear bland and boring.  He's wondering if he'd view it differently, if 
he was a different intelligent species, looking at humans.

Chris, you're a guy.  Of course you think women look beautiful.  I think women 
look beautiful too.  I've noticed something about myself, which I think may be 
common among most males, is that I tend to look at women much more than I look 
at men.  If I am passing a group of people, my mind seems to automatically 
look for the women.  I think that males' obsession with women causes us to see 
them as more beautiful than men.  I also think that most men are very 
reluctant to recognize the beauty of other men, since homophobia is so rampant 
in our society.  

I've allowed myself to recognize the beauty of other men, and I think that men 
are as beautiful as women.  It is a different sort of beauty, a different 
style, but I think both men and women are very beautiful.  It's a matter of 
allowing yourself to see that.  And not being scared of unexpected emotions.

Subject: Visual Languages
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Chris Hind brought up the intriguing idea of people communicating, using a 
visual language.  He then said, 

"In a line I read from snow crash, languages seem to break apart into multiple 
dialects rather than unify, so it's best to centralize the language but allow 
for unlimited character combinations and voting on new character types so 
allow evolution and flexibility of the language."

Chris, languages don't work like that.  You can't plan it out and expect that 
everyone's going to do that.  People are going to communicate however they 
want to, in their own styles.  Ideas that people like will become more popular 
and as people communicate more with visual images, certain customs will 
develop spontaneously.  It will seem most correct to people to use certain 
images to convey certain ideas, because that's what's worked well in the past. 
 The people that come up with effective images will have their images used, 
simply because people will like their images.

Advanced visual languages are a whole new field open to humanity.  We need to 
let it develop how it will, rather than trying to force it to be like spoken 
and written language.  A visual language opens up a tremendous amount of new 
possibilities for expression and for organizing thoughts. I think it will be 
more than visual, though.  I think people will be doing a lot more with their 
voices and with body language and being expressive with whatever they have 
available to them.  

Language isn't mainly about conveying meaning, which is what it seems like 
you're assuming when you propose planning the language so that we are all 
consistent about what symbol means what.  Language is mainly about evoking a 
response in someone.  Some aspects of language involve symbols which have very 
specific meanings (such as in science and in mathematics), but in general, 
language is a way of stimulating the minds of others to think like you do.  A 
way of spreading memes.  Symbols are only one kind of meme.  A visual language 
makes use of symbols, and it also makes use of many other memes.  Different 
images remind us of different memories, and people use certain images when 
they wish to evoke certain memories in others.  Images are combined with 
others, or are displayed near each other to deliberately form a link between 
the images in the viewer's mind.

Chris, the visual language is already being used, and it's been around in many 
forms for thousands of years.  It's not something that we have to invent and 
standardize.  Look at a magazine advertisement.  Watch television.  Go to the 
movies.  Go to an art gallery.  These are forms of the visual language.  If 
you wish to communicate with a visual language, develop your skills in graphic 
arts.  Learn to create images.

So many tools are being developed now that make it much easier for people to 
create very high quality images and communicate them with others, that 
creating images is likely to eventually become as popular as making sounds.  
People will then communicate much more through images than they do now.  But 
we will still use sound, I'm sure.  We will use words still, I'm sure.  
However, tools are also being developed that allow people to generate very 
high quality sounds.  New sorts of musical instruments are being created that 
will be very powerful and versatile.  People will be able to play these 
instruments with data gloves, worn on their hands and connected to small, 
powerful computers.  Creating music is likely to become as popular as speaking 
is today.  People will grow competent at expressing their own emotions through 
the music they will be generating pretty much all the time.

Conversations in the future will involve people generating images and sounds 
(as well as other sensations) for each other and responding to each other.  
Just like some musicians now are really good at playing together, making stuff 
up as they go and each playing off what the other does.  This will be done 
with sounds and images in future conversations.  They will resemble "jam 
sessions", and things will be pretty intense, lots of organized information 
getting passed back and forth.

I might create an image around us of an open meadow, and you might create 
flowers and trees which blossom around us.  Someone else could join in, 
creating a soft and beautiful melody, slowly rising and filling the air as 
someone makes the sun rise and adds clouds to glow with glorious color.  
Someone else will contribute, with a clam deep voice, saying softly, "We wake 
to a new day, a day of promise, a day where we will create the fulfullment of 
all our deepest desires."

Our dialogue would be a shared art project, each of us playing with and adding 
to the contributions of the others.

What we choose to create is what we communicate.

Come on, guys. Let's remain on the carpet (though this is sure excellent 
news). But there are a lot of steps still to do to make it to the 
Singularity. 

The Singularity is not unavoidable, alas. It looks very good, so far. But 
I prefer to keep my fingers crossed, yet.

Caveats: It depends, whether strong (Drexlerian) nanotech is workable, 
furthermore on continuing availability of biocompatible habitats, which 
is not certain, should inner planets of our system to become disassembled.

It depends on the cell damage. A dry, rigid system, which operates by 
mechanosynthesis has got some problems in a wet, squishy body. It can't 
achieve atomic resolution, because the stuff is so wobbly, but it will 
detect macroscopic defects, even misfolded proteins. It's pretty big, so 
it has to elbow away cells on its way. It will need infrastructure to be 
provided with fuel from an external source (orelse you'll need to eat 
_huge_ meals) as well as pipelines to access prefab stuff from caches, it 
will need means of communication with its kin (emergent behaviour of agent 
clusters).

Right.

It depends whether Singularity will zoom its blue-shifted streak across 
the sky and transcends quietly, or remains linked to matter, busily 
gnawing away at easily accesible resources first, disassembling even 
relatively inaccesible things at the bottow of gravity wells later. 
Whether the Powers will remember their origins, and treat bipedal 
primates kindly or merely as a light-element source, remains to be seen...

I believe that the primary reason for women being portrayed by most as 
the more "beautiful" gender is found in traits associated with youth.
Most secondary sexual characteristics imply that they "perish" less from 
age than do males: lack of facial hairgrowth, smaller hands and feet,
rounder (arrgh, isn't the 'b' word censored by AOL?)...

These often imply characteristics of youth.  For this reason, many people 
find androgeny to be a "beautiful" triat of either gender.  However, this 
does not preclude non-youthful traits from being found beautiful, in 
which the "perishing" is done with character.  LIkewise, non-androgenous 
triats are sometimes admired for the virility they exhibit, like stout, 
stubbled chins.

Yup, that's a good'un... as well as its more up-to-date cousin called 
"LOJBAN." (A websearch on LOJBAN could tell you plenty.)  It has been 
computer-tested to demonstrate that the language is NON-AMBIGUOUS when 
used in its full form.  Every verb has a specified syntax for the objects 
necessary to detail its action... if an object (or subject) is implied or 
ommitted, its absence is immediately noticed.  Ambiguity is still 
permissable, but simply by ommitting the information.

Similarly, there exists a variant of English called "E-Prime" which is 
designed to exclude a lot of amibiguity.  It achieves this by removing 
the verb "to be." ("E-Prime = English - to_be.")  This effectively 
eliminates a huge number of oversimplified analogies/metaphores by 
demanding more active verbs in descriptions, and kills the passive voice 
of the laguage altogether.

Even the language "tlhIngan Hol" ('Klingon') changes thinking by removing 
the verb "to be" and eliminating adjectives.  Adjectives are replaced 
with "active" verbs... a red ship would be "Duj Doq," or more literally 
"Ship Be-Red."

David Musick argues that Language is not a vehicle to convey meaning but 
a method of provoking response in a meme.  But I believe this is not yet 
adequate without a little further qualification:  Language is a means to 
the ends of meaning... Meanings are a means to an ends of Response & Meme.

Words often have a multiordinant nature... some have an explicite 
meaning, while others have numerous associations.  When a language 
effectively redirects meaning, it effectively redirects how we 
communicate our meaning or lack of meaning.  

Sometimes it is ambiguity itself that we capitalize upon in language.
Many forms of Humor and Irony just don't work without duplicity or
omission.

But you ignored my third and most important point: c) because government
has a heavily enforced monopoly, one cannot take ones need for services
elsewhere, while with private business, one can go next door if one
feels like they are not getting the level of service they deserve.

At my knowledge, the Logban (or Lojban) supporters haven't yet published 
a book. Do you have the bibliography of this book?

Well, that is in some sense cheating (meta-cheating?) and doesn't

Yes, although interfacing them to your body may be a bit complicated
since your muscles would not become faster, so you could think movements
faster than you can actually do them; even upgrading the muscles would
probably not help, since they will still move more slowly than your
thoughts.

That is probably even easier than rebuilding the neurons. I would 
probably replace my skull with diamond filled with nano-memories and 
processors. Hmm, an extensible mohawk cooling system...? :-)

Languages, like French, English, etc., haven't changed subtantialy
in the last century althought our vision of the world changed very 
much. Those languages don't correspond anymore to our contempory

[Abstract: remove from, separate]

The primary abstration of reality is made when we perceive the outside
world. We see, smell, hear, feel, etc. only a sample of what is out there.
Then we arrange the perceived world in a collection of objects, give 
meaning and relationship to those objects. And, only then, we translate 
it to a language.

I'm not so sure of that. A researcher at Palo Alto's research center 
told to Wired Magazine:

   "In its ultimate environment, VR causes the
   computer to become effectively invisible by taking over the human
   sensory and affector systems. VR is extremely useful in scientific
   visualization and entertainment, and will be very significant for
   those niches. But as a tool for productively changing everyone's
   relationship to computation, it has two crucial flaws. First, at the
   present time [1992], and probably for decades, it cannot produce a
   simulation of significant verisimilitude at reasonable cost. That
   means that users will not be fooled and the computer will not be out
   of the way. Second, and most importantly, it has the goal of fooling
   the user - of leaving the everyday physical world behind. This is at
   odds with the goal of better integrating the computer into human
   activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world."

When telephone was invented, many predicted that mail would disapear.
It didn't.

When radio was invented, many predicted that newspapers and books would 
disapear. It didn't.

Now that numerical communication appears, you predict that written 
communication will fade away. I'm septic.

I never wrote so much since I use a computer!

It seems to me that communication tend to be more a serial process than
thinking (or thinking more parallel than communicating). Ideally, we should have
specific languages for communicating and different ones for thinking.

Thanks Twisty. BTW I like your pages. Do you think that there is a
possibility that we would find the most dense planets of any solar
system in the so called "zone of life" that Earth occupies? If so, this
would greatly help locate extrasolar planets.

I have argued from the beginning that we should stick to facts and logic.
It is one thing to suggest the *possibility* TWA Flight 800 was brought
down by a Navy missile.  It is another thing to *announce* that is what
happened -- which is precisely what a couple messages reposted to this
forum did.

I never ruled out the possibility of a missile.  However, the cover-up
theory as presented is absurd.  It suggested the complicity of an entire
crew of a Navy destroyer, multiple gov't agencies, and the White House.  I
just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees
aren't that competent.

In fact, it was on the basis of questioning gov't and media that I
suggested Salinger was an unreliable source.

But look at how quickly you and others embraced Salinger's remarks and
proclaimed victory!  (Remember, you originally stated that Salinger's
comments "proved" it was a Navy missile.)  I don't know what brought down
TWA Flight 800.  The official investigation doesn't appear to know what
brought down TWA Flight 800.  What we should be skeptical about is people
thousands of miles removed, with possible political motivations, or an
affinity for conspiracy theories, making spectacular but unsubstantiated
pronouncemnets about "what really happened."

Hmmm.  I distinguish between arguments based purely on appeal to authority
versus arguments that are supported by authoritative sources.

Never questioning "authority" is one extreme.  Always condemning authority
is another.  In my universe, authority is generally earned, so in itself it
is not bad.  There are abuses of authority.  But guess what?  There are
even more abuses by people with only self-appointed "authority."

If you are in a position of authority and declare TWA Flight 800 was not,
in your opinion, downed by a missile of any kind your assertion will be
questioned, doubted, and even contradicted twelve ways till Tuesday.  I
don't see why the same shouldn't apply to uncredentialed conspiracy
theorists.

>I've never said "the Navy did it." I believe 90% a missile did it.

I don't have enough information to say it was or wasn't a missile, but I am
increasingly doubtful it was a missile fired by the U.S. Navy and then
covered up.

>IAN: Agreed. I question authority, it seems you mostly question
>those who question authority, which is fine, so long as we don't

I think you are right.  I tend to believe authorities in various fields
before I believe people who come out of nowhere with sensational stories.
However, I also recognize the positive role that radical, "outside"
thinkers can play.

I notice, however, there are radical optimists and radical pessimists.  I
tend to pay more attention to the former.  In my view, people who come up
with potentially new and better ideas always deserve a hearing.  At some
point, on the other hand, people who continually tell us the truth isn't
what it seems, but can never prove it, and argue that you are obviously
naive or have been duped if you disagree with them, deserve to be tuned
out.

He's intellectually dishonest because he tried to take personal credit for
a "document" he never bothered to check out.

Yes Ian, only a scoundrel would accuse other people of criminal behavior
and then refuse to show the "proof."  This is called slander.

I am not the one trying to prove what happened.  Admittedly, it strikes me
as more honest for a Navy official to leave the door open than for
conspiracy theorists to say with certainty "here is what really happened."


I remain skeptical about the conspiracy theory.  I am less skeptical about
a widespread investigation that has not ruled out (last I heard) mechanical
failure, a terrorist bomb, or a missile.  It's the conspiracy theorists who
have already made up their minds and are arguing from emotion.  The
official investigation admits it does not yet have enough facts.

This plane went down over the Atlantic Ocean.  Many of the "facts" have not
been recovered.  Maybe they never will.  It will probably take a systematic
effort by a large number of trained investigators to get the answer.

There are many possibilities here.  First, we don't even know that Salinger
was telling the truth when he attributed the document to a "secret service
agent."  If we are going to question almost the entire U.S. government
(which is OK), we should also be able to question Pierre Salinger (even
more OK).

Does anyone besides me see a possible motivation for Pierre Salinger?
There he is living in left-wing France -- an enlightened country just
trying to keep foreign words from polluting their language.  A number of
French citizens were killed in the crash.  But so far, there is no
satisfactory explanation of what caused the crash.  People don't like
living with such uncertainty.  Pierre Salinger comes along and blames it on
those nasty, foreign imperialists.  Pierre Salinger becomes a national hero
in France.  Many paid speaking engagements result.

I wish I could prove it, but alas, I cannot. <g>

Two things.  First, the truth did come out.  (Or did it? <g>)  Second, it's
easier to mislead people about a relatively isolated action by a single
government agency.  Can anyone convince 300 members of a Navy destroyer
crew to keep quiet just because to do otherwise would embarass the Navy?
Heck, I bet half the people in the Navy are there mainly to get a cheap
education, and are basically honest.  But even if only 10% are basically
honest, does anyone think that 10% would watch a passenger plane get shot
down by accident (I presume) and then agree to silence?  Would none of them
want to know someone had the courage to reveal the truth -- especially when
it could be their families or friends on board the plane next time?

Is cynicism extropic or entropic?

I like this idea of a hierarchical language you should develop this idea
more and create icons for it.

John, would you please give me permission to post this post on the current
HotWired Brain Tennis thread about nano? That thread REALLY needs to start
discussing the potential of nano and how it could be done rather than the
philosophy of nano.

I agree with that earlier drag clothing comment. Men dress in drab clothing
and the only men who don't usually aren't hetero.

I suppose we _can_ recognize the beauty of men without being attracted to them.

 If we were frogs or bisons, we would still find the other sex
attractive and desirable, wouldn't we?  We would just develop
a different set of "beauty recognition" criteria.

 In the circumstances where males due to greater strength and
ability to mate with more partners than females, play a more
active role in partner selection, it is natural that they will
have stronger feeling of preference ( = "sense of beauty"), and
female[ gene-set]s would concentrate on developing bodies
corresponding to these preferences.  The evolved male-specific
parts of the beauty-recognition system may have been shared with
females after it was developed in males; I would expect that
gender-specific genes would occasionally mix - just to test
whether one sex's invention may be of use for the other.
That's how you can find nipples on men or same-sex preferences.
(That's all my speculation).

Some recognition criteria may be too broad and exploited in
"perversions" - I think sexy ("aerodynamic") curves played a
significant role in my buying a Saturn, or our liking panthers,
vases, or paintings. Same with voices, etc.
As the population needs a diverse set of physical features,
it needs a diverse set of aesthetic preferences; these sets
coevolve, both driving and mirroring each other.

On another note:

 I used to feel somewhat embarrassed of having a preference for
females in *friendly* conversations; I have a definite sexual
preference here, but I didn't like thinking that I choose a
woman for a friend only because I (subconsciously) find her
promising as a sexual objects. Later I figured it out:  I like
discussing personal issues with people who are sensitive and
have expressive faces.  With that present, the gender doesn't
matter [that much].  Unfortunately, males seem naturally less
sensitive - and most regretfully, in the course of social
"progress" they squashed much of their innate sensitivity
with the outgrowth of macho behavior, where displaying
emotions, wearing makeup, paying attention to little personal
interactions, etc. are strongly discouraged.

  So instead of using social and technological progress to
overcome personal limitations here, people use them to aggravate
the situation.   Not all people, of course...

The electron in a Hydrogen atom can be in 2 states, "spin up" or "spin down", 
and you can differentiate between the two by using The Zeeman Effect. Also, 
an atom doesn't have to stay in its ground state. If R is the radius of the 
orbital of the electron in its ground state, you could also, with a very 
specific amount of energy, place it in a lager orbital of radius n^2 R where 
n is any integer. When the electron falls into a lower orbital, either 
spontaneously or through stimulus emission as in a LASER, it will emit a 
photon of light. You can tell from the amount of energy in that photon what 
orbital the electron must have been in. After you have read the memory in 
this way you'd need to fire a photon back at the atom to push the electron 
back to it's original orbital, but there is nothing new in dynamic memory. 
You wouldn't be limited to the electron either, you could do many of the same 
sort of things with the nucleus, but you'd have to deal with Gamma rays. 
And I haven't even mentioned the weird stuff the Quantum Computer people 
talk about. 

Drexler, the conservative engineer that he is, apparently doesn't think any 
of this will be important until after the Singularity, certainly his plain  
Jane Nanotechnology doesn't make use of any of these exotic possibilities.  
That's why Nanotechnology is a technology not a science.

This is not at all improbable.  The last few years the US has been involved
in a full-scale intelligence war with France.  Contrary to what most people
would think, France is considered to be the number one enemy of the US,
intelligence-wise.  After a couple recent serious embarrassments the CIA has
caused France (such as the GATT incident and the Brazil incident), it
wouldn't surprise me if they took this opportunity to even the score.  When
I was working for DoD, the US was purportedly deporting something like 300
French spies per year.

I would prefer to wait for the final autopsy of the wreckage.

Very interesting.  In a sense the language would be somewhat fractal in
nature.  I wonder how you would encode something like this?  I suppose a
simple version could be done using something like hypertext.  You click on a
concept to resolve a particular concept in finer detail, or maybe have a
more global resolution mapping.  The plus of this type of heirarchical
language structure is that indexing could be very precise, much more precise
than current single-level linear documents.

Actually, (I am writing this as I am thinking) it might be very nicely
encoded in a type of object-oriented paradigm, similar to object-oriented
programming tools.  You could generate (and encode) new concepts and words
as extended instances of a base class.  This would force structure upon the
language without really putting any constraints on it.  It would probably
also make language processing and comprehension software much easier to
write and model, since it would eliminate ambiguities.

Using an object-oriented paradigm, you could control resolution by selecting
which level of object (concept) inheritance you choose to view.  A person
who doesn't want to know the most intimate details of a concept could choose
to view the more generalized base class of that object, and so on.  You
could, theoretically, encode the entirety of human knowledge by subclassing
a single base class a very large number of levels.  This type of language
encoding would be well suited for computer implementation.

I would be willing to discuss this in great detail with an eye toward
implementation, now that my interest and intellect has been piqued.

No, I could be wrong about the book.  But there was definitely an 
article in Scientific American, which I still have, but I can't find it 
right now.  It was called Loglan, as in log-ical lan-guage.  Loglan. 

There is a classic story called "Gulf" by Robert Heinlein, about a 
secret society of scientists, who invented an artificial language to 
increase their intelligence.  Highly recommended.  

By the way, Walter, you really must look up the difference between 
"septic" and "skeptic."

you seem to be opposed to. You even refused to present any facts that
invalidated the documents you totaly dismiss, choosing instead to call 
Salinger a "dishonest scoundrel" for possesing them. I cannot know
his reasons for withholding them, but it looks pretty bad by any 
measure, but the TWA 800 crash is not about persnol reviews, 
at least not to me.

The only logical-type argument I've seen you made is that it can't have 
been a naval hit because you can't get govt employees to keep secrets. 
The more evidence to the contrary we ignore, the more plausible this 
nonfactual argument appears to be. 

Your rationale for the nonpresentation of facts was an appeal to the 
inherent reliability of the authorities -- let them think for us and 
us smear all those who dare to think for themselves. It's such a worn-
out tire. The more facts we ignore, the more we can believe that the 
FBI is a reliable source of unaltered physical evidence.

If your only going to offer personal assessments rather than review 
of factual data or logical analysis of the case at hand, please don't 
reply or bother to draw me into further debate. Thanks.

A cynic doubts everything for any reason, and usually in spite of the
facts. A skeptic demands truth and proof. There is a difference. Blind
optimists usually confuse one for the other..

We know for one that this particular White House is capable of covering
up ANYTHING that will preserve its power. We also know that multiple
government agencies which work under the blanket of secrecy everyday do
know how to keep a secret (SR-71 for ten years, the Stealth Fighter for
more than ten years, as well as some things you have no idea about yet). 
In addition, something you may not know anything about Ira, is that on
Naval vessels, there are very few, if any portholes. ANything happening
in one section of the ship, due to its armoring, and the noise of
internal machinery, would be drowned out, and those individuals
involved, the vast number of whome are of low rank, know that if they
are given an order to shut up over something that gets classfied, they
will easily die if they open their mouths. I know this due to my own
experiences in the US Military. The phrase "we take care of our own" has
many meanings, some of which are pretty insidious.

The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the
failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be
fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb
traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for
shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no
where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane
experienced. What is left?

The fact that it is Navy vessels collecting the debris is like letting a
crime suspect examine and collect the evidence at a crime scene.

This is an active area of research.  IEEE sponsors a symposium on 
Visual Languages each year.  I have the proceedings of the 1993 
meeting.  It's a 400 page book with more than 50 articles; here are a 
few sample topics:  

  Animation of algorithms 
  Fractal approaches for visualizing huge hierarchies
  Interacting visual abstractions of programs
  Graphical front ends for visual languages
  Generating Smalltalk code from graphical operations and rules
  Metatools for language translation

IEEE also sponsors an annual meeting on visualization, distinct 
from the above.  I went to the first one, called Visualization 90, 
six years ago.  Some sample topics from that meeting:  

  Visualizing computer memory architectures
  Wide-band relativistic Doppler effect visualization
  Techniques for visualizing Fermat's Last Theorem
  Volume visualization in cell biology
  A journey into the fourth dimension
  Human perception and visualization 

Anyone who wants to pursue this subject should join IEEE and go to 
these conferences.

Most likely the planets in the life zone will be denser than the planets 
outside, since the heat will have evaporated volatiles like hydrogen and 
helium (and thus reduced their mass).

My theory about the relationship of different densities in our own system 
sorta springboards into other theories.  Seems to me there is also a 
relationship between planetary rings and low planet density, as well as a 
relationship between Life and high planet densities.

Low planetary density can amass large total gravity while amassing lower 
local gravity.  This should be why Saturn, the solar system's least dense 
planet, has the most splendid ring system.  Low local gravity allows more 
stable particle orbits around the rings.

Earth is the most dense planet in our system.  It stands to reason that 
its greater density and lower total gravity allow for some mighty-complex 
systems to form.  Perhaps Earth is the model of Extropian "Spontaneous 
Order."  Newton's Second Law of TD says that 'in a closed system, it can 
only degenerate into a state of lower complexity.'  With Earth open to 
the sun's energy, and its great density and moderate temperature 
facilitating the most fluid of systems, Life has the best chance of 
forming and/or continuing.  (By "most fluid," I mean the "triple point" 
between boiling point and freezing point provides more range for liquids 
to exist due to higher pressure.)

I'm only an amateur, (can't afford Institutionalized Ed without mortgaging 
my future,) so I can only offer speculation about locating extrasolar 
planets.  The four known discoveries of such planets have been due to 
sheer mass pulling their suns in rapid cycles.  We need to improve our 
perception, collect more discerning data, to find small-but-dense planets 
like Earth.  Gravity alone doesn't cut it, because Jupiter is so much 
more massive (despite being less dense) that the sun get eleven to twelve 
times the pull from Jupiter than it does from Earth, regardless that 
Jupiter is four times as distant.

Density of planets today are estimated by visibly measuring speed, 
distance, and diameter, in order to take a stab at the mass, and thus 
mass per volume.  One has to be in visual range to make good 
measurements.  It doesn't look as if this method will change in the near 
future.  Even if it did, we'd still likely have to move pretty close to 
these bodies to determine density... There just aren't enough indicators 
that can be read from an interstellar distance (at present).

Hmmm... this coincides with my design of a Virtual Reality system that 
breaks up visible details into layers of heirarchial relivancy.  The more 
distant an object, the more its smaller details become irrelivant.

I've long believed that the greatest indicator of intelligence is in its 
increasing layers of discernment. The more characteristics that can be 
discerned, the more completely one models the reality.  So much VR is 
more Virtual than Real, I push for VIRTUOUS Reality... something rich 
with characteristics and properties.

It's little wonder that the man who coined the term VR was pushing for 
something he calls "post-symbolic communication."  When a popular Science 
journal asked the simple question "what is VR?" he replied somthing to 
the effect of:
  "It's like real Reality, but more elastic and malliable.

In my own experience this relationship *does* exist. Certainly I have
experienced rudeness in privately-owned stores (in England, people working
in many shops seemed generally to ignore customers more commonly that I've
experienced here in California), and I've been treated decently in
government-run establishments.

However, *all* of the extremely bad experiences I've had have been in
government places: a truly horrible exchange on the border of Calfornia and
Mexico. That time I really had to struggle to avoid punching the other
person (and I'm *not* a violent person!). I've had two or three nasty
experiences with immigration-type government agencies. In the case of *real*
services (i.e. not as in "Internal Revenue Service") run by the state (Post
Office, etc.) I can't say I've had much worse treatment than in private
business. Most bad experiences have been due to imcompetence and slowness
rather than malevolence.

Lyle, if we separate state agencies like IRS, INS, and the rest, from
government services, would you say state agencies were ruder than private
businesses?

The reason it took a day and a half for the post to appear is you used
a "::" to prefix your comments. This was the command prefix for the
old extropian mailing list. Since a lot of people still try to send 
those commands to the new mailing list, I have all messages that start
with the double colon bounce to me for approval. If you want your message
to show up in a timely manner, use a different quote prefix.

Even with the unlimited memory you imply for your Powers (BTW, what would 
be the point of having more than one of these all-knowing beings?), even if 
they are able to immediately view anything they ever knew, why should they 
remember anything that we know now? WE were once embryos and (most) 
remember nothing from that time.  A galactic brain, for example, is no more 
going to 'remember' a single planet than we 'remember' a single cell in our 
bodies.

You imply that Powers won't have to be grown, carrying and running up 
through the trellises of the universe (the Zones), that they won't evolve, 
they'll just 'magically appear' after the God-given Singularity of 
Transcension.

<Our sole responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are; any

Rather Deathist I'd say - counting on the children to carry on for you.  It 
seems like you're saying that, since *you* can't possibly see *all* then 
there's no sense in trying to fathom anything.

<Also, I doubt the Zones are a metaphor for anything.>

Yes, you doubt.  I leave myself free to imagine: associative thinking, 
non-local reasoning, traversing the Web, scoping the boundaries of the

Yes, I *now* recall reading this somewhere, disagreeing, and that's why 
Twirlip's original reference to the Zones as a mere gimmick set me off. 
 I'm sorry, I prefer the Vernor Vinge who wrote _AFUTD_, not the one who 
speculates on the coming Singularity.  Too many people (I'm not implying 
Vinge) seem to see this as a magical, effortless, sudden transcension.

P.S. This thread was originally on Zindell. My favorite quote of his from

I think this is a good corrolary of Tolkien's claim that "perilous to us

According to Webster's dictionary, a cynic is someone who is
"contemptuously distrustful of human nature and motives."

It is also possible to be skeptical about some things and optimistic about
others.  I tend to be skeptical about suggestive "here's what really
happened" stories, and optimistic about the future.  IMO, not such a bad
philosophy.

There is a difference between be willing and being able.  The White House
may be willing to cover up anything ...but can they cast a spell on
hundreds of investigators?  Are there no political rivalries within the
U.S. government to get in their way?  If things are so monolithic, why
doesn't Clinton just declare himself Emperor For Life?

You are right about naval vessels.  My experience with the U.S. Military,
however, is somewhat different.

And, I see other revelations coming out of the military almost daily.  If
people are willing to circumvent the system to reveal sex scandels, I would
think some would do the same for mass murder.

That's true, but we are talking about the military *plus* other government
agencies.  I am hardly convinced that Bill Clinton loves, respects, and
would protect the U.S. military.  In fact, I can see a motivation for
Clinton to nail the military.

That could be.  But it contradicts your theory that only a small part of
the destroyer crew ever knew.  This would mean several ships are now in on
it.

>Skeptics of what?

Skeptics are people who demand truth and proof.  That's your definition --
and I agree with it.

The issue here isn't whether you are skeptical and I am not.  To me, the
issue is that some people are suggesting that since the government
sometimes lies (which it does), it always lies (which it does not).

I don't say you are wrong to doubt the official investigation, I say I am
also not wrong to doubt the conspiracy theories.  The fact is, the
conspiracy theories are based on selective reading of what are at bottom
just more press reports.

So it comes down to what we know and don't know.  We know 100+ people
believe they saw a missile.  We know eyewitnesses at night can be
unreliable.  However, even if we decide they really did see a missile --
which I do not consider unreasonable -- I have heard no "facts" that prove
it was fired by a US Navy ship.

You can't argue *both* that the US Navy can keep anything quiet they want
*and* that you or others know it was the Navy -- unless there is objective
proof like photographs of the ship firing the missile, US Navy missile
debris washed ashore, or whatever.  Otherwise, how did you find out what
they are so good at concealing?

I recognize the US Navy missile theory is in many ways more attractive and
exciting.  Arguments like "here's what really happened" and "you are being
lied to" and "we know the true story because we have pieced it together"
are not based in fact, however.

We know that terrorists have been targeting US passenger planes.  We know
there have been some Islamic fundamentalists arrested and convicted in the
New York City area who have vowed to take revenge.  So I lean towards the
terrorist theory.

But I am not mad at anyone for leaning in other directions.  For me, this
isn't about which theory wins or loses, this is about finding out what
really happened.

The "triple point" of a compound is the temperature/pressure range that
allows the existence of 3 of the 4 possible phases.  The "triple point" for
water is well outside the range of what most organisms would call
"comfortable" since the pressure is significantly below 1.0 atmosphere and
the temperature is below the normal freezing point of water.

This aside, I think you are generally correct.  Liquids generally have the
smallest range of any phase.  For a system to take advantage of the unique
properties of water, it requires that the system be well suited for the
semi-perpetual existence of liquid water.  Ice isn't conducive to life and
very hot water/steam is extremely destructive to organic compounds.

The Bekenstein Bound is just a corollary of the quantum nature of
Nature.
Remember the "hidden variable" propositions?  They are futile attempts
to
"describe" the quantum realm in terms of derived concepts like
subjective
reality.  Even today, many decades after the discovery of quantum nature
of the universe there are few people who can conceptually grasp QM.  It
seems to my humble consciousness that a similar thing is happenning to
string theory at the moment, but I'm just an interested observer and I
don't want to nurture hyperbole.  If a revolution is indeed in progress,
I expect we'll end up with a more fundamental theory resulting in QM as
its observable approximation.  Beware, in a stringy universe the concept
of spacetime itself emerges from the theory; in contrast, in QM it's the
stage on which the events happen.  Perhaps the quantum layer will prove
to be the last useful one for practical storage of information or
computation, but there's no way for us at this point in history to
comprehend what realms might lie beyond (boars and pearls come to mind).

Yeah.  Only in this area of the ideosphere (ideo-archipelago?

Only the thousand words used to describe the picture[1].  We moved away
from hieroglyphics to arbitrary ideograms and letter-cominations/words.
I suspect general intelligent abstract communication centers on
intelligences agreeing on arbitrary symbols for common ideas, somehow
inducting that the ideas are in fact common.  The main benefit of
complex visual symbols versus spoken and written words would be if our
brains were better at processing one species than the other.  Given how
we evolved, I doubt this is the case.

Truly flexible Powers might use whatever symbols they felt like.  The

the mental ability to perceive symbols of various types -- such as many

when they are being used as arbitrary symbols in logic games
[Hofstadter], or my suspicion that I'm worse at computer chess because
the graphics don't trigger my chess perceptive networks.

Which is why studying etymology is neat, and the history of one's
language.  E.g: the proposal that English spelling be reformed so that
each phoneme has one spelling would lose information: words with 'ph'
for the 'f'-sound tend to be Greek.

All hail the Scots/English/evolutionary Enlightenment.

(now, if there's a disadvantage to each spelling mapping to one phoneme,
I haven't thought of it.)

Dear Science / Computer Science Site,

This morning, prominent author and futurist Howard Rheingold launched
ELECTRIC MINDS (http://www.minds.com), an online destination where 
experts
and knowledge seekers gather to share news, analysis and opinion about
technology, science, computers and their affect on peoples' lives. We 
are
inviting individuals and users at technology, college and social 
computing
sites to participate and share a common vision with us, as developing
community is essential to long-term success of the Web and loyalty and
connection between people is as important as ideas and information. By
balancing content and online conversation, Electric Minds is driving 
the
evolution of the Web from a publishing medium into a social medium - 
the
Social Web.

We are *not* just a magazine online - who would care?! We are a living,
breathing, dynamic community where some of the smartest thinkers from
around the Net will come each day to discuss, debate and connect with
ideas, visions and news of our brave new Web world. More than product
reviews or digital fashion, Electric Minds is about meaning and 
context.

Recently, Jerry Michalski of Release 1.0 commented, "Most Web sites 
create
content, context or conversations. Few do any worthwhile integration of 
all
three elements, and none enrich the combined materials over time, and 
turn
them into long-lived resources for use in other media. Electric Minds 
is
the first company I have seen that is creating such an environment. 
Because
it combines crafted points of view, snappy conversations and links to 
other
such conversations across the Net, its system should have broad 
appeal."

As a virtual community, we combine content from high-profile 
contributors
with facilitated conversations using Web conferencing systems. 
Contributors
for the site include HTML guru Laura Lemay, VRML co-creator Mark Pesce,
former San Francisco Chronicle online commentator Bob Rossney, Virtual
Reality author and Silicon Graphics VR evangelist Linda Jacobson and 
many
others of similar repute. Rheingold himself wrote the bestselling book, 
The
Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, which sold
100,000 copies in 6 languages. Furthermore, we are a global family, as 
we
have contributors from Japan, Australia, France, Germany, England and
across the US giving street-level reports on technology and digital 
culture
as it happens. We are part university, part laboratory, part magazine 
and
part thinktank.

We look forward to your participation, feedback and enthusiasm in our 
new
adventure - see you there!

The Electric Minds Team

             In the tradition of Future Shock and Silent Spring -
               Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds
                       Sample chapters: http://www.charlesriver.com
          ROCKLAND, Mass., Nov. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Two best selling authors
from
very different backgrounds, Gregory Paul and Earl Cox, team up to present the
scientific, sociological, and theological issues that we will face when
brains
are down loaded into receptacles and machines become better than humans.  The
resulting book, Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds, is
published
by Charles River Media, Inc. (sample chapters: http://www.charlesriver.com,
price: $20.95):
          *  Explains how the greatest revolution in Earth's history -- the
replacement of human intelligence by cyber-intelligence -- will probably
occur
within the lifespan of many who are alive today;
          *  Combines the knowledge of an evolutionary biologist and computer
scientist to project the evolution of robotics and its effect on society;
          *  Describes the ultimate Internet, the direct co-mingling of human
consciousness in electronic computer systems.
          *  Presents a realistic, often irreverent, look at the future of
religion
in the 21st century.
          "This book argues that the next century will prove to be nothing
like this
one, nor any forecast so far.  Computing power, neuroscience, and
nanotechnologies are advancing so rapidly that they will combine to produce
the most significant evolutionary developments since the origin of life
itself.
          "We maintain that the human mind and conscious thought are
exclusively
natural and physical in origin and nature.  Ultimately, their natures and
fundamental processes are knowable and can be replicated for the purposes of
personal immortality." -- from Chapter 1: Down the Yellow Brick Road
          The Authors
    Gregory Paul, an evolutionary biologist, is both an artist of prehistoric
life whose work was used in the movie Jurassic Park as well as an
accomplished
writer for such magazines as Scientific American, Science News, Nature and
The
Smithsonian.  His previous book, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, is a best-
seller and Book-of-the-Month Club selection.
          Earl Cox is an international authority on the applications of
artificial
intelligence.  He is founder and president of The Metus Systems Group and
regularly contributes to many AI periodicals and consults for many Fortune
500
companies including AmEx, Motorola and the FAA.
          Pre-Publication Comments
    "... In a time when technology advance is a hard driving army, it is most
often ignored that the greatest advances come from the flanks.  Paul and Cox
have captured the very essence of now-based potentials...  I shall refer to
it
many times."  Lee Kent Hempfling, Chairman/CEO Neutronics Technologies
Corporation.
          Availability and Ordering Information

This is extremely naive.  Hundreds of US sailors of the USS Liberty,
which had been attacked by Israel (with rockets, cannon, napalm and
torpedoes) in 1967, were kept quiet for years under penalty of
court-martial and long sentences in the brig.  They suffered 34 dead and
171 wounded!  Americans never learned the truth until Jim Ennes' book
came out in '79--12 years later.

Did any sailor who took part in the shooting down of the Iranian Airbus
ever say a word?  Or the ones on the USS Stark who were attacked by our
ally, Iraq?  An inquiry was conducted by the navy but we never heard the
results.

What about the sailors on the destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin, which was
supposedly attacked by N. Vietnam?  Did they ever say a word about it?
This phony attack started the Vietnam War.

What about all the attacks our wonderful boys conducted against the
German and Japanese navies while we were "neutral" in 1940-41?  Did one
of them ever say a word about it?

What about the navy personnel who participated in the autopsy of JFK at
Bethesda Naval Hospital?

The writer has no idea of the fear which the military can create in its
personnel, or how low it will stoop to create that fear.

This is the same US Navy which framed a dead victim of its negligence in
the explosion of the USS Iowa's gun turret.  Not only did they frame him
but, for good measure, said he was a homosexual to boot.

Anyway, how do we really know that there was only one US ship within 180
miles of Long Island that evening?  All we know is what the navy tells
us, and the navy tells us they didn't do it.  That doesn't mean they did,
but it doesn't mean they didn't, either.

While this is a logical answer, recent extrasolar planet discoveries
show that this is not always the case, or else their data is
significantly off.

Why are these entropic?  Because it doesn't describe the astronomy, or
because they're location-centric?  They certainly vividly describe the
perception.

Actually there are.  The interferometric methods being used by computer
linking distant observatories is breakeing new ground every day. They
have even discovered liquid water on one of the latest discoveries, and
some people are working on a chlorophyll detection methodology.

        I think it's time for a bit of a break from the usual conversation.
Here's a poem I wrote a while ago, hopefully 
you'll find it uplifting.




Former Futures


Add to the world's histories
With the things we already know
Substitute future for present
For a better past tomorrow
And if we add to the world's mysteries
With the things we do not know
It might not be bad but pleasant
To see there is still more to know

With a little bit of hindsight
To help us on our way
We can make tomorrow
Better than today

The past can be deceiving
A fact observed and known
But with a backward glance at mistakes
A future tree's seeds can be sown
Some have trouble believing
That this world has progressed and grown
But now it's time to raise the stakes
Time to let the future atone

With a little bit of hindsight
To help us on our way
We can make tomorrow
Better than today
This world is sure to flourish
If we surpass 'future dread'
Now dwell upon yesterdays
But harvest tomorrow instead

Yet you continue to place faith in agencies who have continually
demonstrated to the world, not just in paranoiacs minds, that they are
lying, theiving, killing scoundrels. A skeptic would demand more hard
proof than just well put assurances from such distrusted groups.

Actually, this is not true. Organic compunds used to living at our
pressure and temp are very sensitive, but only because of the elements
their prtiens use to bind themselves together with. A protein molecule
is like a messed up ball of yarn, with energy bonds wherever the strands
cross. TO do its work as a protein, it must have a certain amount of
springiness to it to stay in solution, and must be able to be broken
apart with little energy input. Too much energy input, and the molecule
will break apart and precipitate out of solution, which is how egg
whites get white when you boil them. Using different elements at the
energy bond points than is used for normal temp organisms allows for
much higher temperature tolerance, as the bonds are much tighter, and
require higher energy input to break them apart, however this makes for
a very tightly bound molecule that only does its chemical work at a
higher temperature. For example, a common protein in bacteria which uses
iron in its makeup, has a corollary protein in hyperthermophilic
bacteria (bacteria that can live above boiling) that uses tungsten
instead.  

These bacteria have been recovered from deep sea volcanic vents, deep
oil wells, and deep geothermal systems, and have exhibitied preference
for temperatures above 180 degrees F (about 90 C) up to as much as 275 F
(about 130 C). As more varieties are recovered, the upper limit seems to
creep higher, especially as specemins are recovered from deeper and
deeper sites.

They are not monolithic. They only appear so until someone is brave

Yes there are members who have not been properly "taken care of". Many
women still do not feel like they are treated as part of the military,
or only view it as a way to get free education, or try to use the system
for personal aggrandizement. I've witnessed flase harassment cases
personally. Not against myself, but against others. I was the key
witness in a case in which two female airmen framed a male airman with
such claims. If I had not overheard them talking about it beforehand,
his life would be over.

I am not saying the truth may not come out. If some agency with
equivalent power shows an interest in invesigating this in earnest, I
can guarrantee that any witnesses will come out of the woodwork. Until
such a time, the operating rule among lower ranking people is: COVER
YOUR ASS, SQUEAKY WHEELS GET TOSSED OVERBOARD, and WHISTLE BLOWERS GET
IT JAMMED DOWN THEIR THROATS. I've been there, done that, I know what I
am talking about. Anyone with a tale to tell needs a lot of cover
overhead to make it home.

If word got out right before the election that a navy missile shot down
one of our own airplanes full of people, with all the other examples of
either corruption or incompetence in this White House, his approval
rating would have gone into the shitter, and Dole would have had a field
day.

It would mean only a few knew of the missile being fired. Likewise, only
a few members of a salvage crew ever see the debris recovered, and
incriminating pieces could easily be tagged underwater with transponders
to be picked up by sub. Sub based salvage operations have been conducted
by the Navy in the past, including the recovery of a whole Soviet
submarine. Never heard about that, did you?

Yet if someone you knew lied to you half the time, wouldn't you only
believe 50% of what they say?  50% is enough to suspect someone, even
enough to bring criminal charges against someone in court or convene a
grand jury.

And the commonly accepted views of events operate the same way. The
"winners" in history pick a story that is believeable, and find the
facts to fit. ANything else is dismissed as wacko.

The Captains log has not been released to the public, and has been

Witnesses and the public statement of a DEMOCRAT who has long experience
in White House and other high level government business. 157 eye
witnesses corroborating each other is a much bigger statistical lump to
dismiss than just a few confused reports. If facts are not true, they
typically are widely varied in being described by witnesses. When they
all agree, that typically means that is accceptable as a fact.

A good investigator does not take someone off a suspect list simply
because they say "I didn't do it".  Anyone with means and opportunity
should be pursued to the fullest extent of the law, even if they are the
law, and especially so if that is the case.

John Clark said "Anarchy means no government," and Suresh Naidu responded, 
"Anarchy means no authority."

John is very close, but Suresh is way off.  Anarchy means no coercion.  In a 
condition of anarchy, people would be voluntarily doing whatever they do; no 
one would be forced to do anything they did not want to by any one else.  The 
economic model in an anarchy could be socialistic, capitalistic, communistic, 
or whatever, but what makes it an anarchy is the fact that everyone 
participates voluntarily; no one is forced to participate.

An anarchist is one who does not believe in, advocate or engage in forcing 
others to do anything against their will.

There are different degrees of anarchists, from hard-core pacifists to 
totalitarian dictators and psychopathic annihilatists.  There are the 
pacifists, who won't use coercion even in self-defense.  There are the types 
of anarchists who will defend themselves with force, but not anyone else. Then 
there are libertarians, who let people do whatever they want to do as long as 
they aren't hurting anyone else.  Then there are people, who are fairly 
typical, who pretty much let people do what they want, as long as they pay 
taxes and obey the right laws and so forth. Then there are totalitarians, who 
let people do whatever they want as long as it's exactly what the totalitarian 
dictator wants them to do. ("You can do whatever you want, as long as it's 
what I want you to do")  Then there are the people who don't think we should 
exist at all, and thus have no choice about anything.

I'm the kind of anarchist who will defend myself from attack, with deadly 
force, if necessary.  I am also inclined to defend people I love, if it 
doesn't endanger me too much and to defend strangers from attack, if it 
doesn't endanger or inconvenience me too much.

I am dedicated to increasing extropy in myself and in the world.  I have a 
strong belief that people will be the most productive and achieve the swiftest 
progress when they think and act for themselves, of their own free will.  I 
seek to teach others how to think for themselves and to create for themselves 
the lives they want to live.  I believe that nearly all people will benefit 
greatly from allowing others a high degree of freedom, and I am working to 
spread that belief.

I believe that coercion is entropic and that it slows down progress.  That is 
why I am against it.  My main commitment is to progress, and I view anything 
which interferes with progress as something to be overcome. (I define progress 
as an increase in extropy)

     The goal of the Prometheus Project is the fully reversible suspended
animation of humans. This revolutionary idea has been a topic of science
fiction for decades and was briefly considered by NASA for long-range space
travel in the early 70s. Until now, however, no one has seriously believed
that it might be achievable within our lifetime.

     The Project began within a small group of futurists on the Internet who
were discussing recent developments in organ preservation. After over 20
years of underfunded, painstaking effort, the accomplishment of fully
reversible long-term cryopreservation of human organs is now within our
reach. From this discussion grew the idea that whole-body suspended animation
is now probably attainable within 20 years.

     The Prometheus Project conditional pledge campaign was developed to
gauge whether there is sufficient support to launch this revolutionary
project. Because of its length and difficulty, the Project will be done in
two parts.

     The first part will show full recovery of the central nervous system. In
essence, this will be a ten year feasibility study to decide if the Project's
main goal, suspended animation, is achievable. This initial work is expected
to require about $1 million per year to accomplish. Four months into the
pledge campaign, over 30% of the required funds have already been pledged.

     The second part of the Project will need considerably more funding. But
with the convincing demonstration of the suspended animation of the central
nervous system provided by the first part, it is expected that this larger
amount will then be obtainable.

     The Prometheus Project will be conducted by top scientists in the
required disciplines under the aegis of a for-profit corporation which will
be formed for this purpose when the pledge campaign has reached its funding
goal. No money is due for share purchases until the required total has been
pledged, and pledgers have approved the science and business plans for the
Project.

     If the Prometheus Project's goal of fully reversible suspended animation
is successfully accomplished, it will have an enormous impact on the practice
of medicine. Doctors will have the option of placing their terminal patients
into suspended animation until future technology can cure what is killing
them. Many people with incurable and terminal conditions will elect such a
procedure with the reasonable expectation that advances in medical science
will find cures for their conditions in the near future. They would then be
revived and cured before rejoining their loved ones and continuing the life
that would otherwise have been prematurely taken from them.

Anders, what does that last line mean?  Also, what's platonic materialism?

I am a little slow on the math here, but aren't wave packets in physics a
lot like wavelets?  If so, wouldn't it be possible to pick and choose
between all sorts of basis function sets, not just pure space or pure
frequency?  Maybe we (meaning, the computers we download into) could be
reimplemented in more and more spatially smeared, more and more frequency
localized ways.  Is time-smearing an independent variable here?  Somewhere
I got the impression that this is what "uncertainty" tradeoffs are about,
or is a very close analogy to it... can someone straighten me out (or bend
me, as appropriate)?

Also, wouldn't the "domain" you're localized in determine how you
perceive the multiverse as split into branches, in the multi-worlds view?

The particular application I'm thinking about right now is, er, dirt-
computing.  Just realized I haven't really coined a better term for it;
let's try this:

    Dirt Computing: using matter to compute, in a way that
    looks (at first glance, to some observers at least) like
    undisturbed nature, whether motivated by stealth, efficiency,
    or other concerns.

(Which points up an interesting thing about current spread-spectrum
communications in this context: Although privacy and pure efficiency are
concerns, the main driving force for it right now is how it lets you
*share space and frequency* more gracefully.  "Dirt communications" is
being developed as a method of *peaceful coexistence*.)

If one can choose how to be smeared, then wouldn't all the wacky
wavelet bases be available, too, and pseudo-random ones?

Anyway, if mere spacetime smearing is available, that means civilizations
with a lot of patience could spread themselves more widely and be less
vulnerable to local attacks or sensors.  You could also be doing something
that seems to have very sensible circuit diagrams to you, but looks like
dirt to others.  That means only the post-singularity physicists, not the
post-singularity computer scientists, have to do impossible things.
I hope those Jupiter-brained nerds appreciate my suggestions.

I imagine events on our macro time and space scale appear like weather

dealing with us is like dealing with weather, and watching us is like

IAN: Let's be optimistic: we're getting heaps of more govt, but heck, 
govt is great, let's have more, why be such a anti-govt pessimistic
party pooper, join the happy govt club.

It seems to be a universal tactic all over the internet that those who
want to pooh-pooh the Navy TWA 800 theory are actually assuming to score 
points against the theory by suggesting that those who broach the theory 
are saying "here's what really happened." Yet in fact I've yet to see 
someone, with perhaps the exception of Salinger, say that. 

But even if one become 100% convinced that X happened, how is this 
anti-thetical to optimism? This suggestion seems a plea to ignorance:
"no nasty bad conclusions, only nice happy days, no mean bad conspiri-
tors, the only 'slave' is the one who sees evil, think happy thoughts 
and all those bad thugs out there will just go away."

Just when I was getting comfortable being an atheist, the God Meme strikes 
again!  This time as a mutated, more robust infection.

I can't remember exactly the strange and twisted path my mind was wandering, 
but somewhere along the way I was considering the universe as a whole and 
existence as such, and I was thinking about the Singularity and what types of 
activities those awesomely powerful beings would engage in.  It seems like 
creating universes and manipulating space-time itself may be child's play for 
such powerful beings.  Then came up the notion, which I've heard discussed 
before, that our universe may have been created by a physicist/hacker from 
some other universe.  So, the question was, and still is, was our universe 
created by a conscious being?  Is there some awesomely powerful being creating 
endless varieties of universes, tweaking with the parameters and seeing what 
happens?  Perhaps some of these universes develop in very interesting ways to 
this being, and they receive a great deal of attention.  Perhaps there are 
certain qualities that the being is looking for and hoping to take advantage 
of, such as intelligence and creativity.  Perhaps as life and intelligence 
begin developing in a universe, the being influences the universe, to 
encourage that development and help it flourish.

Now I'm noticing the deep similarities to my wandering thoughts and many of 
the ideas in religions.  Perhaps there is a God who created this universe and 
helped encourage the development of life and continues to nourish the growth 
of greater intelligence in this universe.  When I look at this idea in light 
of the ideas I thought of earlier, it does not seem so silly.  I'm not 
thinking that a lot of the patently absurd ideas that the religions also teach 
may be accurate, but maybe the religions are right about a few things...  

Perhaps it is possible for sufficiently intelligent beings in our universe 
(such as humans) to communicate with this highly advanced being, who created 
the universe, and receive some sort of assistance.  Perhaps this god has been 
busily forming methods of communicating with the intelligent creatures it 
helped develop in its experimental universe.  Perhaps certain states of mind 
facilitate communication with "God".

These are all very big maybies, and I have no evidence for or against the God 
Theory or even any reason why it would be useful to explain any phenomenon, 
except possibly for the fact of our existence itself.  If there is a God, 
perhaps It will provide some useful and clear evidence.  Or perhaps we are 
incapable of understanding such things until post-Singularity?  Perhaps God's 
main goal right now is to help us advance to the post-Singularity state, so 
there can be some sort of meaningful dialogue between us and God.  God 
probably doesn't care whether we believe in God or not, just that we are 
making ourselves more intelligent and creative, so we will be more useful in 
God's enormous system which has entire universes as components.  And perhaps 
God is also in some other GOD's system of universes....  The Ultimate Fractal

Just something to think about.

To use VR as a comm. tool it doesn't need to be much more advanced 
than it is at the moment.  Having an extra dimension in 3D as opposed 
to 2D "writing" lets us use the extra dimension to represent more 
information, eg. closer to you might be earlier, while further away 
is later.  This allows us to arrange info in a more meaningful 
and intuitive way.
The minimum requirements for this setup are:
  a navigable 3D environment with moderate resolution (1024 X 768).
  a way of hanging documents, movie clips and sound in this 
  environment.
Current VRML specs are very close to achieving this.

Agreed, maybe I did not emphasize my last phrase enough.  I think 
that written speech will become a subset of our communication which 
incorporates sound, images and writing.  It will definetely not 
disappear (not soon anyway).

If we think parrallely, it would be a great advantage to be able to 
communicate in this way as well.  Computer networks work best if the 
connections are digital, since computers think digitally.

An experience which changed my perception of beauty was my first time 
in a gay bar.  My usual programmed hetero-male instincts orient me to 
a 'predator' type behaviour in normal social situations.  All of a 
sudden this was swung around and I became both predator and prey.

Most men are not sexy because they don't really see themselves as the 
'prey', therefore they don't need to look beautiful.  If you earn 
enough money, you're automatically entitled 
to a beer belly and cheap cologne, without jeopordising your mating 
chances too much.  This is also mostly the female's fault for having 
the 'I can't funciton on my own and need someone to protect me' 
meme.

I find both sexes to be beautiful, our only criteria for judging a 
potential mate is no longer child bearing 
ability, rather we find people attractive who would contribute to our 
growth.  Unfortuanately we have a lot of programmed baggage telling 
what is and what isn't sexy.

Yes, 51 Pegasi is weird. But we don't know if it really is a gas 
giant, maybe there are stone giants too. 

(I think that system is going to be on my "must see" list once I get 
out of this solar system).

True. What I really ment with my challenge, was to show that there 
are ways to circumvent the Bound even without introducing unknown 
physics. One of the most obvious would be to let the energy increase 
in a region without limit, that would enable an infinite amount of 
information (this may happen during the Big Crunch).

Perhaps. But it has been rather quiet on the string front, I think 
the theory got stuck in mathematics and didn't get to the physical 
side. Still, some results are fascinating.

Yes, this is the most important problem to be solved. Personally I 
am more interested in non-manifold possibilities; who said spacetime 
is continuous?

Exactly. There might be "information horizons" in physics, levels of
structure that information cannot flow well through (such as the
quantum level; the strings may have their own working information
systems, but cannot interact in any useful way with the emergent
structures on a larger level, which cannot influence the strings
since they are epiphenomena).

<Big snip questioning whether or not there is *a* God>


        In my time in this universe I have come across many people who have
fallen into this meme.  I think it is almost natural for extropian-type
people to eventually ponder this question deeply.  We all want to see past
limits...even of our own thinking.  When I say I'm an atheist, I mean that I
don't believe in the *conventional* 'God' that is worshipped by billions.  I
do, however, have a couple views on the prescence of other 'gods'.

        One such view is that the universe itself is God.  As far as I know
(and maybe ever will know), the universe has always been here.  As far as I
know, the universe has no end; if it does have an end, I'll have to see it
to believe it.  I just can't accept the thought that there is a physical
limit that no-one can surpass.  If it *does* go on forever and always
has\will be here, then it is God.  Every planet, quasar, galaxy et cetera,
is within the universe and has been created by the universe.  Entropy
happens *within* the universe.  Then the universe is omnipotent.  *That* I
can accept.

        Another of my views (even long before I read _Stranger In A Strange
Land_) is quite common to transhumans: that we are all gods.  We create our
own lives.  We can either make millions on a paradigm or live in a box on a
city corner...or anything in between.  We create new beings (procreation),
and eventually, new life forms all together (AIs, etc.).  If we wish to die
or kill something, we can.  The main reason for people not to believe this
is that we are not omnipotent.  The common question comes up: "But who made
us?"  And no-one can answer convincingly enough to sway opinions.

In reply to my statement, 

* Coming back to the original point:  You were saying that there is a

* need to create happy customers, and (b) the level of rudeness in those
* agencies.  If people were rational, this causal relationship would exist,
* but in fact (in my experience at least) it doesn't exist.  I have found

* restaurants, and other businesses, even though they can't afford to lose

That's not a different point, that's just a fuller statement of (a).  

Let's also give a fuller statement of (b), as follows:  

(b)  Government employees NEVER treat the public like human beings, 
but private businesses generally do.  

As I understand it, your argument is:  (c), therefore (b).  

I'm saying that even though (c) is true, the predicted effect (b) has not 
been observed, at least not in my experience.  People in businesses, 
including small shops, are insulting and spiteful whenever they feel like 
it, even though they know perfectly well that offended customers will 
go elsewhere.  

In my experience, rudeness has been a random phenomenon:  
I have been treated well by people who could have treated me like shit 
and gotten away with it, and I have been treated like shit by people 
who were only hurting themselves by doing so.  

The constraint of the marketplace must have *some* effect, but 
it sure isn't apparent to me.

Maybe so.  I have heard (can it be true?) that IRS agents are generally 
not as nice as teachers and librarians.  But I couldn't say from my own 
experience.  I've never had any contact with INS, and my only contact 
with IRS has been through the mail.  My policy about taxes has always 
been:  they can have my money, but they can't have my time.  I have 
never been audited, because my tax returns are so simple there is really 
nothing to audit.  

Some people on the list, such as Davin Enigl and James Rogers, 
seem to have had extensive experience with federal agencies.  Maybe 
we should get some input from them.  

If you are going to make a distinction between agencies like IRS and 
agencies which provide services, then you are going to have to make a 
corresponding distinction between different kinds of private businesses.  
Compare IRS with collection agencies, slumlords, used-car salesmen in 
blue-collar neighborhoods, doormen and deejays at certain nightclubs, 
paparazzi, crack dealers, pimps...   Not all private businesses have the 
same standards of gentility that one finds in a Barnes & Noble bookstore.

The trick is to know what's going on and be able to take on multiple points
of view.  Sometimes when I watch a sunrise, I switch back and forth.  I see
 the sun rising, then I see the earth turning towards the sun and the horizon
falling away beneath it.  It's an interesting exercise; like looking at the
boxes illusion and seeing the boxes going into the page, then coming out of
the page.  How many times you can switch from one to the other in a minute
may be a measure of some cognitive capacity worth measuring, but I don't
know.

Thanks, David.  I think the problem isn't "::" by itself, since I have been 
using this as a self-quote prefix for some time.  The problem in this case 
is that "::" was the first thing in the file.  That's what set off the
bounce.  
As you say, "I have all messages that *start* with the double colon

Like hell.  Visualize "sunset".  Now visualize "dusk".  Which image do you
want to remove from your list of communicable images (I don't know about yours,
but my image of "dusk" has no sun in it)?  What kind of 1984-type language
reductionism is this?  why don't we just call them "light-start" and
"dark-start"?  Yeesh.

Sorry for the outburst, but I love the English language for its richness.

"Patient" comes from the Latin root "pati-", "to endure".  I can certainly
see how that applies to both senses of the word.  Saying that someone (like
a doctor) makes a "horrible patient" captures both at once.

"Teacher - student" is a relationship that applies when someone who has
certain knowledge has agreed to transmit it, and someone else has agreed
to receive it (or in school to at least be present while it's transmitted --
sigh).  That the teacher might learn something in the process doesn't
invalidate the relationship.  Sorry, I think this one has a place in the
language, too.

BTW, if I had to pick a word whose concept I'd like to erase from the language,
I think I'd have to pick "sin" hands-down.

Out of curiosity, what would you do with "fall in love"?

Cheers,

Michael Lorrey,

I can't argue with most of your last post.  Just one point:

I thought the witnesses said they saw what looked like a missile -- not
that they specifically saw a missile fired by a US Navy vessel.

BTW, I have never said the investigators should rule out the Navy as a
possible suspect.  Honest investigators will go through many suspects, but
hopefully they will only accuse the one who is actually guilty.

But maybe I have missed something.  Please tell me what factual evidence
there is that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a Navy missile.  I still
don't know who is the "AI" on this list, so maybe I also missed the Navy
missile evidence.

Two days ago you asked me not to "reply or bother to draw me into further
debate."  Please note the above was not addressed to you.

Since you previously accused me of using ad hominem arguments, I think it
is fair for me to point out that you are now resorting to "straw man"
tactics.  I have never advocated "more government."  In fact, my advocacy
of significantly less government is documented in two books and dozens of
articles.

Nonsense.  The message "forwarded by Peter James" and posted to this forum
stated "TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE."  When I
expressed skepticism about this statement, you accused me of denying that
TWA Flight 800 could have been downed by a *missile*, which is also not
what I said.

Have a nice day :-)

If there is a God I certainly wouldn't count on any assistance from Him. 
By definition God is omnipotent, so He could have made animals in any way He 
wanted to, but He chooses to do it by Evolution, that is, by mutation and 
natural selection. A slower, crueler, more painful process I can not imagine. 
I can only conclude that God is a sadist who enjoys watching conscious beings 
suffer, so if God ever gives me some advice I intend to ignore it.
                  

                >Perhaps this god has been busily forming methods of

                >develop in its experimental universe.  
                  

I think God should enroll at a junior college somewhere and take a few 
courses in communications. We can talk with our fellow creatures, you'd think 
an omnipotent being would be at least as good as we are at it. Anyway, if an  
infinite God already existed I don't see why He'd be the slightest bit 
interested in the development of finite beings such as ourselves, except
perhaps to make Himself feel superior. 
                  

                >I have no evidence for or against the God Theory or even any

                >except possibly for the fact of our existence itself.  
                  

If the God Theory could explain our own existence then that would be excellent 
evidence that it is true, but it can't do that, all it can do is kick the 
problem upstairs and then refuse to discuss it further. It's all very well to 
say that God created the universe, but that immediately suggests another
question that the God Theory has no answer for.
                  

                >If there is a God, perhaps It will provide some useful and                 
                >clear evidence.     
                  

If God wanted his existence known surely an omniscient being could have 
thought of a way, if He's hiding, then to detect Him we'll need to outsmart 
God.              

                >Or perhaps we are incapable of understanding such things

I don't know what He's waiting for, even pre-Singularity humans can understand 
the concept of "yes" or "no". So what's my opinion, does God exist? 
Probably not, at least not yet.

...........Today is Yesterday's Tommorrow.......

Look here young man an' listen, 
You're only ninety one.
You'll never see what I've seen
Or done what I have done.

There used to be this pastime
that everyone called  "work,"
The government was king of all, 
- your leader was a jerk.

We always had to eat,
we always had to sleep,
the flesh went fast,
the times were grim.
Your time you couldn't keep!

They made us deal is cash,
this thing that makes no sense.
The cars could even crash...
and taxes were intense.

No ships went out in space,
to earth mankind was bound!
You had to keep your race
Exactly as 'twas found

Your sex was even given
by some genetic code!
Can you imigine livin'
in one consistant mode?

So if I hear you bitching 
how slow the pilot flies
or someone's missed your birthmas
Or gave your mistress eyes.

Ask if you thought before you talked! 
You might remember this:
that sometime back
they stopped the lack,
And extropy was grokked.

You may feel cold
when you are told 
that people used to die,
but not as cold
as years untold...

On ice
as I  did lie.

IAN: TWA is not TWA is TWA is not.  Say that 10x fast.

But seriously, TWA flight 800 is what it is, only relative 
to its external area, which contains all that it is "not."

Apart from external reference, there is no "TWA flight 800."
If a thing is all those elements necessary for its specific
identity -- and I've seen no more logical measure of "is" -- 
then TWA 800, in one piece or many, is the whole universe.

Be sure to check out the TWA 800 page, where I've amassed

Subject: "Death Machine" software available on internet

The following item appears in the November 9 issue of medical journal LANCET 

AUSTRALIANS PROVIDE DELIVERANCE ON THE INTERNET
by Elizabeth Finkel 

The computer programme "Self-Deliverance", which was used in the world's
first legal medically assisted suicide is now on the Internet:
<http://www.taunet.net.au/deliverance/>. The programme is freeware,
available "to allow other developers to modify the programme".

According to Philip Nitschke, the Northern Territory doctor who assisted the
suicide and helped develop the programme, the purpose of placing it on the
Internet is to demystify notions of "computer death" and also to expedite
the legal processes doctors and patients from other states must undergo
before they can make use of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally
Ill Act.

Self-Deliverance was designed by Nitschke and computer programmer Des Carne.
The programme is interactive, and confirms a patient's sentience and
intentions three times. A click on "yes" the third time activates a syringe
driver and a sequential delivery of thiopentone sodium, pentobarbitone
sodium, and pancuronium.

Initially a simple "press button" option was offered, but, says Nitschke,
"that caused a furor of concern . . . someone might accidentally trip . . .
so we developed this interactive lap-top computer set-up. It also removes
the doctor from the patient's personal space . . . they don't really want
him there". According to Nitschke there have been many misunderstandings but
the use of "Self-Deliverance" makes sense only where it is lawful and
subject to scrutiny.

The deep sea vents have single celled and multicelled organisms living in and
next to them.  The extreme thermophilic bacteria live and grow at
temperatures well above 100 degrees C.  I predicted these organisms (and
bacterial life in space) would be discovered in 1975 when most other
microbiologists disagreed with me.  Less than ten years later, the extreme
thermophiles were discovered.  And, Mars may have had bacteria.

I seems impossible for a water based life form to survive much less even to
live and actually grow _and_ reproduce at temperature 60 degrees C,  because
of protein destruction alone.  Yet,  they do even above 100 degrees C.
  Also, remember the high pressures in the deep sea vents.   in the late
1980's I researched pressure to kill bacteria.  I found 30,000 psi starts
killing, but not until 60,000 psi do you get commercially feasible kill.
 Even then, you must quickly pressurize (a cell normally liking atmospheric)
and then quickly de-pressurize (in less than 100 microseconds) to get several
log reduction.   Bacterial spores of _Bacillus_ and _Clostridium_ are the
most resistant.   The extreme thermophil spores can survive 121 degrees C
steam autoclaving for  365 days of exposure (the longest I've seem tested). 

Cold preserves most types of cells (but not for coliform bacteria e.g.,
_E._coli), the colder the better.  Some mold (possibly _Pseudomonas_
bacteria) will grow below 0 degrees C. How is that possible?  How can water
freeze and the cell survive or even grow?  One answer is: It _doesn't_ freeze
inside the cell via "natural" anti-freezes e.g., sugar.  (BTW I don't like
how the word "natural" has been "Deo optimo maximo" in food stores).

Life is less fragile than even _I_ think it is.  In 1975, I though I was
mighty optimistic.   I've spent my professional life for 20 years researching
microbial control and bacterium, yeast and mold cell injury "natural"
recovery mechanisms.  I then develop methods to "artificially"  (another
evolving word) recover injured cells.  I'm constantly amazed at life's
resiliency.  Based on what I've seen I would not be surprised if human
cryonic suspension works.

DNA studies make me think the extreme thermophils are one of the first like
forms and were not adaptations of later life forms.  If this is true, cells
were assembled, adapted (evolved) while under extreme environmental pressure.
 This could mean life is abundant in the Universe and in places we don't
expect it to be.

Sexy & beautiful = ability of prey to attract the hunter? Somehow, I just
know you're not involved in a meaningful relationship.

Most men are not sexy? Duh! Some men are not sexy because their higher
brain functions are inabled. The earth is full of poised, confident,
ingenuous, beautiful men willing to learn, grow, and to take the risk of
equal responsibility and caring. Life is not a hunting party. Like attracts
like.

First, nobody has THAT much money! The mating chances of the inabled are
equal to 3-second voluntary copulation with similar prey - with dissimilar
prey, by force. If mating means impregnating the prey, fine. If mating
means a bonding partnership, the guy is a loser.

When I was a kid, my mom made me go to catholic church, catechism, and
the whole bit.  I was of course reading science furiously, and she
wasn't much of a catholic.  This is just what I finally decided that
god was, if there was one: some guy running the universe as a
simulation.  Sort of like Game of Life on a grand scale, he sets up
the equations, sets the constants and the initial conditions and
watches it go for a while before tweaking and starting again.

I came to this conclusion when I was maybe 10.

It was only later (a couple years ago) when I was reading "Atheism,
Ayn Rand and Other Heresies" that I found that in the old days, this
was called Deism, and that many of the US "founding fathers" held to
this sort of view.

Pretty interesting.

I go back and forth between this view and "hard atheism".


BTW, I find David's posts probably the most interesting and thought
provoking currently on the list.  That may be because I've been on the
list for over 5 years, so I've seen most everything else rehashed 12
times already!  ;-)  But I don't think so.  Kudos.

Yeah, the circum-black-smoker ecosystem is kinda fascinating... H_2S-linked 
life frolicking in a heavy metal soup, truly cool. Giant poganophores. 
Elsewhere: Christ, yukky spaghetti bacteria. And archae, the weirdest 
bugs of them all. (Them archae are of the greatest significance, whether to 
pure or applied science. Remember where TAC Polymerase came from? Big $$$'s).

Current estimates say beyond 150 deg C hydrolysis rate rises alarmingly, 
so it's kinda safe to suppose no beastie (as we know it) can live beyond 
160 deg C, or so. This said, current book dogma supposes (primitive) life to 
extend several km into the crust, which was hilarious just a few years back.

I'm pretty wary concerning the LGM bacteria... I'd rather investigate the 
Jovian and Saturnian satellite, some of them have lots of liquid water, 
and funky compounds on the surface/solution. It may well have some kind of 
life, at least precursors of it. What's the branch, exobiology/exochemistry (?)
That's where we should be poking about, not this stupid Mars. 

I certainly can't understand all the fascination with the fourth plant. 
Sending men to Mars? What for? Rather a couple of tiny probes into the inner 
system, and _for God's sake_, let's start sending autoreplicators to the 
Moon/asteroids. Industrial processes in high-luminance, hard vacuum 
areas, that must be serious fun.

Uh, wouldn't that involve tolerating macroscopic cracks? I mean hardy, 
and all that, but it's a bit much for a higher organism. The O. Visser 
breakthrough (if indeed...) looks good enough, but look at the size, and, 
more importantly, the kind of the organ desuspended. Cryonics is all about 
brain preservation, and the brain is pretty different from a bag of stupid  
smooth/striated musculature. Also, it's a lot larger than the average rat 
heart (on the second thought... nah, skip that), has uniquely high 
phospholipid content, and lots of vascular lumen almost begging to nucleate 
ice growth. I'd rather go for clean EEG/MEG fingerprint, than a bit of 
muscle contraction.

I can imagine running a destructive (AFM/sublimation enhanced contrast/UV 
laser nonthermal ablation) scan of a vitrified cerebrum, winding up with 
a (somewhat large) voxel set, which runs through several stages of 
de-freeze-artefacting ANN filters.... Whether you use that to fashion an 
upload model, or build a brain (and a body to match) with nanotech from 
scratch is up to you.

But just just HF-flash-devitifying the poor brain pan contents, 
expecting it to work... I dunno. It sounds a lot like Mary Shelley, or a 
neocannibal kitchen recipe (but it will be sickly sweet due to 
residual polyol content and it's probably unsafe due to possible prion 
presence, so rather don't).

That's the current dogma, but why this darned Silence in the Skies, then!?
I don't buy all the Great Filters, and Transcension looks more than a bit 
like a deus ex machina... Have we overlooked something obvious? Must we 
send interstellar probes into our immediate vicinity to find out, or will 
system-local investigations tell us enough?

Also, there are plenty of men with the meme 
"I'm worthless unless I can lord my crappiness over somebody, therefore I will
take my club and go grab some helpless female by the hair and drag her
around for all the world to see."

Or maybe I've seen "When Women Had Tails" (a B movie, not porn)

By the way, John Clark's post on the "God" thread was a good anchor to

'teach' comes from roots meaning "show", and is related to 'token'.
'Educate' is "to lead forth", 'instruct' to "build in", a la structure,
which is related to 'strew'; "heap up".  So 'teacher', 'educator', and

Casual Nobility
---------------

Safe inside this dome of glass I ponder on the meaning of it all
Splendid sensibility and casual nobility:
Rational agility proves to me that my purpose isn't small

Secrets found and pleasure gained a name
The future came and my life remained a game;
Embassy of logic grew
While I knew that my world would never be through -too much to do

I can go the distance and do what I want to do, when and how
Like transhumanity and temporary insanity
The falsehoods of vanity only guise the meanings of the here and now

A spotlight shone on the land before dawn
I merged my brain and brawn -I was not a pawn;
Reason shaped my trembling mind
And I could find that I wouldn't get behind -nothing could bind

So noble but so casual,
Severely crucial to the sacred will

Free to find a destiny and fulfill the search made for a long-lost goal;
My neo-personality, my stellar rationality
Antecedent brutality gone forever from my unencumbered soul

No more lies -my spirit shall always rise
The only prize is symmetrical compromise
The present's all that I can give,
But I forgive because I will always live

So noble but so casual,
Severely crucial to the sacred will

Following up on Kennita's tips for a fun sunrise, allow me to suggest this
exercise:  Tilt your head toward the North (rotational) pole and try to
picture the Earth's rotation about the Sun.  Can you see the moon?  Throw it
in, too.

If that hasn't got your head spinning, work on solar system's trip through
the Milky Way (best done at night, natch).

In my experience with federal agencies (and having worked for federal
agencies), the people who work there aren't nice because they don't have to
be nice.  Being nice has no impact on their jobs.  Unfortunately, many
federal employees are under the impression that citizens REQUIRE their
services, often leading to a small power trip for the federal worker
involved.  From my own personal experiences, I can tell you that being nice
or pleasant in no way impacts a federal employees job performance appraisal.
Showing up to work is about the only requirement, and even that is kind of
fuzzy.

And another thing:  People work for federal agencies because they are not
capable or competent enough to get a job in the private sector.  The people
who work for the government are from the bottom of the barrel.  Anyone who
is any good quits and works for the private sector.  This is the reason I
don't work for DoD any more.  What happens is you get a concentration of
people who would *never* cut it in the private sector.  The federal
government is the employer of last resort.

And yet another reason:  People are promoted based on seniority, not
qualification.  The cream does not rise to the top in the federal government.
And people wonder why so many government agencies are mismanaged.

That said, there are a few agencies in the government who have their act
together, but they are far and few between.  I think many government
employees need to be reminded that they work for *us*.

If 157 people all said some form of: "I saw what looked like a missile,
I saw a missile, I may have seen a missile, etc" chances are that there
is some truth to their statements.  If there are on the other hand many
wildly contradictory stories, then an investigator assigns probability
values to various pieces of  each story based on the amount of
corroboration.

Eyewitness accounts are considered factual evidence, are they not?
The fact that much remains classified is a smoking gun in and of itself.

Using your pet theory, that the French Intelligence servicess are
somehow stirring things up, I can also see a possible scenario: that
French Agents were escaping US jurisdiction on the plane with some
extremely dangerous intelligence. Navy Captain, at the direction of the
DIA or NSA, says, " Fish food, anyone?" This idea is only as implausble
as your rationalization.

True, there are some organisms who can thrive in this environment, but their
makeup is significantly different than surface dwelling organisms.  The
pressure where they live allows liquid water reactions to continue to occur.
Even then, there is a soft limit somewhere around 150-170 C for most
organics.  The absolute hard limit on any planet is somewhere around 375 C
since this is where water goes supercritical, although very few organics
would survive even to this point (except maybe some halides and a few
proteins).  Cells require a pretty broad spectrum of organic compounds to
operate, and the number of options decreases rapidly as the temperature
increases.  

Sub-zero lifeforms are not that unusual, although it is unusual for higher
lifeforms to exist in these environments.  In an environment that is
perpetually subzero, I would expect to find either very primitive nervous
systems, or nervous systems that operated in a different fashion than ours.
The nervous systems found on this planet don't operate well in cold
environments, since they rely on ion/molecule transport.  This is why
mammals found in cold climates on this planet require immense quantities of
insulation.

I saw this twice in my relatively short military career.  I too was witness
in one incident that the charges were intentionally fabricated.  The problem
with women in the military is that too many of them *don't want* to be
treated on an equal basis with the men.  They want a civilian life plus a
uniform.  The much lower standards for women in the military only aggravates
and encourages this.

This is very true.  The military takes care of its own, and generally runs
on its own set of rules.  Political or judicial action rarely has any impact
on the fundamental SOPs and culture of military life.  You're either in all
the way or you won't last.

A missile would leave significant residue traces if it impacted on the
plane.  If the missile was proximity fused, it would leave a very
identifiable signature on parts of the plane due to the nature of proximity
detonations.  Since it has not been mentioned anywhere, I will assume that a
proximity detonating missile did not bring down the plane.  

The Navy's Standard missile (presumably the one used this scenario) most
likely uses a large composite warhead of RDX and TNT, both of which leave
significant chemical traces, especially TNT.  However, no significant traces
have been found of any explosive.

Essentially all military explosives are detectable both by explosive
detection hardware (like TNC) and residue traces.  Therefore, assuming that
the facts available are correct and true, then military explosives are not
involved.  This would significantly lessen the possibility that the military
was directly involved.

HYPOTHESIS:  There are much lesser known classes of explosives which 1) are
not detectable via normal explosive detection hardware, and 2) do not leave
chemical traces normally associated with explosives.  This would force the
general requirement that the explosive was loaded on to the plane, not
delivered by missile.  This would also generally show significant intent,
since these explosives would require custom manufacture by a knowledgeable
explosive chemist.  In turn, this would imply a bit more intelligence and
resourcefulness than your average terrorist.  If you suspect the government,
Sandia NL could easily produce the required compounds.

Ummm..., yes and no.  It means that they all *perceived* roughly the same
thing.  Don't want to split hairs, but there is a difference.  Witnesses are
a poor substitute for physical evidence.

<It appears that you want only Powers ascribed to Omega, anything less,
any intermediate level (like Jupiter-size brains or gallactic minds) is
"just ridiculous, wildly impossible"!!??>

	One hundred percent absolutely correct! The Powers will think faster
than we are, be smarter. How in the world do you imagine that they'll
get to an "intermediate level" and just *stop* there? The essence of the
Singularity is that a smarter being has an increased capacity to invent
still smarter beings; that's why everything goes to infinity.

<Even with the unlimited memory you imply for your Powers (BTW, what
would be the point of having more than one of these all-knowing
beings?), even if they are able to immediately view anything they ever
knew, why should they remember anything that we know now? WE were once
embryos and (most) remember nothing from that time.  A galactic brain,
for example, is no more going to 'remember' a single planet than we
'remember' a single cell in our bodies.>

	When you see a bear, you don't suddenly conceive of "the bear". You see
a picture of the bear complete with millions of pixels, every one of
which you consciously perceive all at once. I doubt the Powers will
settle for less; why should they?

<<Our sole responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are;
any problems beyond that are not ours to solve.>>

<Rather Deathist I'd say - counting on the children to carry on for
you.  It seems like you're saying that, since *you* can't possibly see
*all* then there's no sense in trying to fathom anything.>

No - I'm saying that since *no mortal* can imagine someone smarter - not
more intelligent, but smarter - there's no sense in trying to fathom the
Singularity.

I'm saying that problems which can occur only when transhumans are
already around should be left to transhumans. There's no reason for
mortals to think about those problems or try to solve them with our
inadequate brains, especially when they'll all have such simple and
obvious solutions to the Powers.

Nor is it the children who will carry on: I said "The Powers, our future
selves." But you're right - in a sense it is Deathist, in the sense that
there is a Great Boundary which we need not think beyond. For some, the
boundary is Death - for me, Singularity.

Whether smarter beings can create still smarter beings at a faster
rate than lessor beings can improve on themselves depends on how the
difficulty of the task of getting smarter scales with intelligence.
It could be that the task gets harder so fast that smarter beings take
*longer* to get still smarter.  We know far too little to say that
this isn't the case.

It would provide an explanation for our existence only by pushing back the
problem a step. We exist because (God) super-aliens running our universe on
a computer created us. But why (how) do these aliens exist. Since
postulating such beings only adds to the number of entities to be explained,
methodologically it's best not to postulate them, unless there are
independent reasons to think they exist.

Actually, there is an anti air missile with very little explosive. The
Sea Sparrow uses a warhead with a proximity fuse which is little more
than a very tightly coiled spiral spring (like in clocks). This sort of
device would explode outside the plane, far enough to eliminate any
possibility of residue showing up on the plane peices, and would simply
slice into the body of the aircraft. 

In this scenario, since the Sea Sparrow is a radar guided missile, it
would hit a plane amidships, where the return radar signal is greatest
(right where the explosion happened), already "sprung", and would slice
into the fuel tank so violently that an explosion would result from
ignited fumes.

There you go, a missile attack with no bomb residue.

IAN: Or to the regions of the known universe said not

to known states are required by relational identity theory,
which speaks to the point you had previously made regarding
a "not universe." The "not" of the whole, is the part, 
thus the whole is internally relational.

IAN: Well, yes, "the internet document" is the one case, and Salinger
to a strong degree -- but it was anonymous. Your right, I previously

I acknowledged my error and said I was sorry weeks ago. I hope

Yes, this is a good point.  The same thing may happen in general with
technological improvement.  The law of diminishing returns can be
expected to apply to super-intelligent beings as well as to us.  Whether
the greater capabilities in the future will be enough to outmatch the
greater problems they face, we can't say.

I read a book many years ago, Infinity_and_the_Mind, by Rudy Rucker.
I didn't really like it very much; it seemed to approach the mathematical
and philosophical concept of infinity from a rather mystical direction.
But he did make some points that have stuck with me.

Mathematically, there are many orders or classes of infinity.  In fact,
there are an infinite number of infinities, because of the general rule
that the size of the set of all subsets of a set S is always bigger
than the size of set S.  It also makes a different whether you are
talking about ordinal numbers, which might include infinity plus 1,
infinity times 2, and such, versus the more familiar cardinal numbers,
which are the sizes of things.

The interesting thing is that as you move to the higher cardinal numbers,
there is no general rule which can be used to understand the progression.
Each class of infinity represents a new direction, a new problem, which
must be understood on its own grounds.  From the counting numbers, we
go to the real numbers (which are a lot more complex than most people
realize); then to the set of all functions.  I don't think anybody
knows where we go from there.

This kind of transition is inherent to the problem; anything which can
be mapped onto an earlier level is no bigger than that value.  It is
only when there is a change in the nature of what is counted that we
go to a new level of infinity.

This suggests to me that super-intelligences may be faced with similar
problems as they advance.  There will be levels, or plateaus, where they
advance to the limit that is possible at that level.  Then some new
fundamental breakthrough is needed to advance to a new level.  Being
smart is not just a matter of being fast (in my opinion), but involves
qualitative changes.

Lyle Burkhead has informed me that I have discovered the biggest sacred cow in 
the Extropian herd with my "God" post.  Is that true?  Are you guys all 
dogmatic athiests?

Well, it's obvious that John Clark is.  It seems like my post triggered of 
some sort of pre-recorded response in John, and he treated us all to the 
typical athiest rant about the logical fallacy of an omnipotent God and that 
such a being would never want to establish communication with lowly finite 
beings such as ourselves.  It seems that John's dogmatism has interfered with 
his reading comprehension capibilities (Dogmatism will ruin your mind; Just 
Say No!).  If my post is read again, it will be clear that I said nothing 
about any *omnipotent* or *omniscient* God.  Imagine ourselves in a few 
thousand or million years.  That's the sort of God I was talking about.  My 
post makes that clear, to those whose minds aren't intoxicated by dogmatism.

When we are very advanced, it is likely that we will be able to create 
mini-universes (sometimes called "baby universes").  Perhaps we will find ways 
to make universes bubble off of our own, and we will be able to design the 
basic features of these universes.  If we can maintain some sort of connection 
with these universes, then perhaps we could find ways of getting them to do 
useful work for us.  Perhaps universes which exhibit life, intelligence and 
creativity will be especially useful to us, and we will seek to create living, 
intelligent universes, so that we can use their intelligence to help us solve 
problems, much like we use transistors in computer systems to help us solve 
problems now.  It seems likely that intelligence and creativity would be so 
useful to us that we would want to encourage and speed up its development in 
any universes which began to display these qualities.  It seems useful to find 
ways to influence these universes, to nudge them in the directions we want 
them to go.  I don't know how much influence we would have or how well we 
would know all the details of these universes, but likely it would be less 
than perfect.  If we could influence conscious, sentient beings to develop in 
a universe, it would be in our interest to assist them in their progress, 
since we are using their universe to solve problems for us, and the more 
intelligent and creative the universe is, the more useful it will be to us.  
The universes we create would probably develop through evolution, but if we 
could have some influence over certain things, we may be able to help nudge 
the evolution more in the ways we want it to develop.  We probably wouldn't 
have perfect control and couldn't make everything exactly the way we wanted 
to, but we may have *some* control.  Perhaps as universes become more 
conscious and intelligent, it would become easier for us to influence them as 
they would be more aware of and able to decode the signals we would send into 
the universe by altering whatever we can.  If the universes become intelligent 
enough, perhaps we could have established some very high quality communication 
with the intelligence of those universes, and perhaps we could design ways for 
these universes to commuincate with each other to some degree, so we could 
organize them into a very large system, which would be even more intelligent 
and useful to us than any of its components.  Perhaps these baby universes 
would create universes within themselves also and become even more intelligent 
and useful to us.  These are some of the computers of the future that I am 
speculating about here.

All I was doing with my original God post was bringing up the *possibility* 
that we won't be the first ones to do this.  I don't think it's unreasonable 
to believe that if it's possible for us to create and influence the 
development of  universes, that perhaps someone else is already doing this and 
our universe is one of the ones they created.  John, I don't know if your 
athiestic dogmatism allows you to think clearly, but why do you insist that we 
will be the first ones to create universes?  Do you think that it may even be 
possible for us to create entire universes at some point in the future?  If 
so, why couldn't a similar being to our future selves have been able to do the 
same type of thing and create our universe?

If we become capable of creating universes similar to our own, it seems 
possible and likely that another conscious being created our universe.  Just 
to make it clear (for the dogmatically intoxicated and mentally impaired): I'm 
not saying this being is omnipotent; I'm just saying that it is a conscious 
being who is very powerful, powerful enough to create universes.  This being 
may have some sort of limited influence over our universe, and as we become 
more conscious and intelligent, we may become more adept at interpreting the 
signals the being is sending into our universe to influence us (if there is 
such a being sending signals).  We may find that following these 
"instructions" consistently brings us great progress, and so we would learn to 
trust and follow these "instructions".

I can't see any way to put this *possibility* out of my mind.  And don't 
anybody give me the standard athiestic arguments; I am very familiar with them 
already.  *Think* about what I have written, and respond out of intelligence, 
not out of dogmatic habit.

It seems like many people become athiests to escape the trap of theism, but 
all they've really done is exchange one dogmatic trap for another.  It doesn't 
matter whether you are theistic or atheistic; if you're dogmatic in your 
thinking you're mentally retarded.  You slow your learning rate way down.

IAN: I don't think that the case for encouraging conspiracy theory
against authority is about "asking the wrong questions," it's simply
encouraging the asking of questions and suspicions about the unreli-
ability and criminality of authorities and of authoritarianism. Because 
power corrupts, a conspiracy theory protocol is rational and healthy for 
the preservation of individual liberties. Conspiracy theories compromise 
faith in authority. Seeing the reality of criminal conspiracy shows the 
inherent danger of unlimited State power, and because indeed authority 
corrupts and thus tends toward criminality, lo and behold, our basket 
of true-life conspiracies runnith over.

WHAT?!! Do you think Bill Gates or Warren Buffett is a stagnant pessimist?

The long-term poor (i.e. not the poor who are working hard at becoming rich)
are generally either passive optimists or pessimists.

This seems to mirror Stanislaw Lem's ideas in Golem XIV, where the SI 
explains that there are many different levels of transcendence, and 
climbing the toposophical ladder involves many choices between mutually 
exclusive forms of superintelligence.

I read an interview with a Russian cosmologist a while back in Wired 
magazine.  His theory of the universe involves smaller 
universes growing off each other randomly, sort of a bubble-fractal 
theory of the universe.  The interesting thing about communication 
between 'parent' and 'child' universe if that no energy or 
information can travel from the parent to the child.  The only way 
you can give the child universe any sort of message would be to imbed 
the message in the laws of the universe.

Well, it is not "breaking", it is a simple, sharp phase transition from 
the precisely defined point in state (=conformation space, form follows 
function (aka mapping (folding) of a linear polymer (string), a 
precisely defined, intricate 3-shape, which maps to the task space of 
that particular protein in a wet context)) to a wide variety (a very 
large region of energetically accessible state space) of denaturated 
structures. This phase transition is large-scale property, where lots of 
uniquely arranged amino acids in a protein chain "don't show their face". 
(A somewhat contraintuitive insight, since usually we're not expecting 
such simple behaviour from an archetypally complex system ;)

It might be irreversible, it might not. Proteins are molecular machines, 
their folding pathways and kinetics have been careful optimized by the 
Darwinian evolution generator process. Even so, the stuff sometime 
misfolds, and has either be marked for destruction, or carefully massaged 
(annealed) by the chaperonine chaps, i.e. hsps.

Predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its primary structure 
(sequence string) is _the_ Holy Grail of computational biology. Protein 
engineering, de novo design and thus soft nanotech are the next logical 
steps, then.

I can assure you, extreme thermophiles bugs use exactly the same amino 
acids as the rest of us, just in a different sequence. A single point 
mutation can increase the stability of a protein dramatically.

Ok, so you're refering to the cofactors. But this is fringe adaptation, 
the rest of the beastie is still conventional. (You're not referring ;) 
to Cytochrome C, do you? Do they actually use tungsten instead of iron?)

Molecular structure or plain morphology? They're archae, they're sure 
simple bugs. Can you specify what you mean by makeup?

Certainly for proteins, for aquathermal water is a fierce solute. There 
are lots of organic compounds which can survive hefty temperatures, 
however. NASA uses polymers capable of withstanding 1500 deg C for short 
periods, noticeably lower temps for indefinite time.

> since this is where water goes supercritical, although very few organics

Uh oh, this is a seriously bad customer. Whether sand or gold, it 
dissolves about anything. Many minerals are of geohydrothermal origin. 
Quartz crystals (which are used for computer and clock xtals) are grown 
in autoclaves by a hydrothermal process (specifically: a transport 
reaction in a temperature gradient).

I beg to differ, only the biopolymer stuff. I doubt steroids will notice 
much of it. Just remember the hopanes in microfossils.

Arctic fishes can exist in contiguous (slightly) subzero habitats. 
They've developed a paraphernalia of methods to cope with this harsh 
environments, particularly advanced cryprotectives, basically 
poisoning ice nucleation. They are also using lots of slime in sensitive 
(gill) areas to prevent ice microcrystals from crossing over into the 
bloodstream. 

For more, have a look at:

Well, they don't use saltatory spike propagation, but everything else is 
canonical. Ok, their lipide bilayer composition is significantly more 
fluid, to prevent phase transitions to a 2d crystal, which is not 
exactly something desirable. Membrane fluidity is dynamically adjusted, 
by expression of the right genes at the right time in the right 
quantity.

It ain't only the CNS, the entire metabolism requires a precisely defined 
point in parameter space. Each reaction shows different response to 
change in parameters, so if you're too much off-key, you're dead. (A 
toast of deuterium oxide to that).

Thanks Lyle for a good laugh this morning!  If it was my cow, it wouldn't be
sacred.  It would be one of those bright colored ones who moos at the horizon.

Seriously, why would you presume logic and reason about such issue to be a
sacred cow?

Personally, I have no evidence that God exists.  She hasn't spoken to me.  I
haven't had a supernatural vision.  My greatest joys come from my own
enjoyment of life, and my most welcomed accomplishments from my own
endeavors. If someone or something is helping me along, deciding my fate, or
causing some of those hard and rough times, then I agree with John Clark
that she/he might take a communications course. 

The Churches of God and religious sects have a corner on the term God, so if
_I_ am to invest in contemplating about a source of intelligence, such as a
God, then it might be better for me to use a different term.

Great.  But my question was/is how does that suggest it was a *US Navy*

Yes.  But how many eyewitnesses reported seeing a *US naval vessel* fire a

Well, not exactly.

But now that I have your attention <g>, I'd like to bring up a topic close
to my heart: personal communications.

No, I am not talking about interpersonal relations.  (I'm what you might
call an outgoing loner.)

In his book _How The World Was One_, Arthur C. Clarke quotes a
little-known, turn-of-the-century science fiction writer describing the
future of telecommunications.  In essence, the sci-fi write concludes that
in the future, telecommunications will be so ubiquitous, so reliable, and
so personal that if you try to call someone and they don't answer, you will
know they must be dead.  (Or frozen?)

My theory is that we are now beginning a second "PC revolution" -- only
this time the PC is the personal communicator.  (Although it is also very
much a computer.)  I believe that within the next decade, on a global
basis, wireless communicators will become as common as TVs, tape players,
and alarm clock radios.  In developed countries, most people will own more
than one.  In less developed countries, they will be quite common -- some
third-world governments will sustain their people's dependancy by giving
the phones away "free."

Sorry, but there is a "conspiracy theory" lurking even here. (!)
Yesterday, a major milestone was achieved with the rollout of a new type of
personal communications service in 11 cities across the U.S., based on a
technology called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).  CDMA -- which has
its roots in jam-proof/secure military communications -- was invented by a
San Diego-based company, Qualcomm, Inc.

CDMA is a wonderfully unique technology.  In fact, it seems to defy all of
the traditional rules of radio communications.  Most engineers were taught,
and have scrupuously followed, the rule that the only way to accommodate
multiple conversations over the airwaves was to put different conversations
on different frequencies.  In fact, it was obvious to any "good engineer"
that putting different conversations on the same frequency at the same time
was a sure-fire recipe for causing severe interference.

Cellular radio defied this rule just a little, by reusing frequencies at
safe distances (using relatively low power radios).

CDMA throws the rule completely out the window.  It intentionally puts all
of the conversations right on top of each other.  In fact, it requires that
all of the signals from portable handsets arrive at the base station at the
exact same power level -- a state of affairs that would normally guarantee
100% interference, rendering meaningful communications impossible.

However, each of the conversations is digitized (i.e., the voices are sent
as bit streams) and assigned a unique "code."  The base station receiver
picks up all of the signals at once; a computer is able to distinguish and
separate the different conversations by "decoding" the composite bit
stream.

To the CDMA engineer, this means designing a radio network in which the
base stations must control the transmit power of every handset to within an
extremely fine tolerance -- no easy thing to do since signals received from
mobile handsets naturally vary more than ten thousand-fold due to fading
and multipath interference (i.e., signals taking different paths and
recombining at the receiver out-of-phase).

However, if one can make power control work it delivers significant
advantages to the end-user.  Since the handset is continually compensating
for fading by adjusting its transmit power -- thousands of times each
second -- the hissing and fluttering sound normally associated with
cellular telephone completely vanishes.  CDMA phones sound very much like
desktop phones; some people will refuse to believe you are calling them
from your car.  And there is another beneficial side-effect of granular
power control: it greatly extends handset battery life.

Now to the "conspiracy."  For the last few years, some of my colleagues in
the telecommunications industry have doubted that this technology could be
successfully commercialized anytime soon.  Some have even claimed the
entire thing is a "fraud" merely designed to run up Qualcomm's stock price.
So as major manufacturers began licensing the technology, and network
operators began to embrace it, some "experts" came to the conclusion there
must be some sort of conspiracy at work.  They began talking about how a
secret "CDMA mafia" was fooling some -- and coercing others -- into
believing this was a legitimate technology.

Well, I now have one of these CDMA personal communication phones in hand
and it does work.  Sound quality is excellent.  Due to its enhanced battery
life, you can leave the phone on all day.  (Actually, it can be left in
standby for two days, or you can talk for four hours, or some combination
inbetween.)  Initial prices are 10% - 15% less than cellular telephone.
However, CDMA claims ten times the capacity of conventional cellular, so
prices will probably go much lower as competition heats up.  It is also
easy to provide features like caller ID over an end-to-end digital network,
so they are part of the standard package.  Some of the conspiracy theorists
are now buying time for themselves by focusing on CDMA's capacity claims,
saying the technology will blow up in operators' faces *later* -- as they
bring more subscribers online.

In this case, the "conspiracy theory" is really just the predictable
reaction of the radio communication industry's equivalent of The Flat Earth
Society.  It is peddled mainly by old-guard engineers (plus a couple of
well-known Stanford professors) who simply can't accept the shift from a
separate-frequency to a same-frequency paradigm.

There is also much progress being made toward accessing the Net via
wireless phones.  AT&T is now selling a product called "PocketNet Phone"
that retrieves intelligently-filtered text from Web pages.  Nokia has
introduced a phone with a somewhat larger screen and built-in Web browser.
If there is interest, perhaps I can post more on this later...

IAN: Eyewitness Lou Desyron (ABC World News Sunday, 07/21/96) reported:

                We saw what appeared to be a flare 
                going straight up.  As a matter of 
                fact, we thought it was from a boat. 
                It was a bright reddish-orange color. 
                ...once it went into flames, I knew 
                that wasn't a flare.

Now she did not say "Navy vessel," nor does she seem 100% positive it was
from a boat, however, when we also consider that the area off-shore was
reserved for navel maneuvers that night, and that such were reported early 
on, and that witnesses saw flares being dropped before the explosion 
(flares are used to divert the course of heat-seeking missiles), it 
follows logically that the Navy must be a suspect. It is not unreason-
able to speculate that the Navy was conducting missile related exer-
cises in the area and a missile hit an unintended target.

I've had a mixed bag.  In general, I fear government agencies.  The one I
deal with get promotions by finding people who are out of compliance with
food, cosmetic, drug or nutritional supplement regulations.  

The USDA:  I have yet to find anyone I dislike in this agency.  The people
seem to competent, helpful and some are recognized world authorities.  When I
call them with a problem, they are not looking for an ambush of any of my
clients.  They do not ask my name or any other ambush information.  I have
yet for them to inspect any of my clients even if we disclose sensitive
information.  In general, this agency will work with me to solve problems.  I
have published a paper jointly with them.   They have some "nice" people and
many have said that they consider themselves as "Your tax dollars at work",
i.e. service oriented.

At this point I should say, if the regulatory agencies I deal with think you
are trying to comply with the law, and not fight them,  they leave you pretty
much alone.

If they get a complaint from a customer about a regulated product,  that's a
different story.  If they think the public will hammer on them for not taking
harsh action.  They will take harsh action and get political brownie points
in the process for doing a good job.  

The FDA:  Basically the FDA is the same.  If they think you are truly trying,
they will leave you a lone.  But,  they do look for trouble, even with out
complaints.  No matter where a manufacturer starts,  they still will find
something to improve upon.   This is how they get funding and promotions.
 They really like to pounce on a company that argues with them.  They will
take any authority they can possibly find in the laws and they interpret the
laws always in their favor to enhance their power.  They will do this even if
they know full well the interpretation will be overturned later in a law
suit.    

The FDA is highly politically correct and will enforce the laws that increase
their power, funding, etc. most.  The animal testing laws for cosmetics are
not currently being enforced because of this.

The Post Office:  Just when I was able to sight horror stories galore, I got
a knock on my door.  It was the local post master. I'm afraid this experience
is the exception not the rule.  He came to apologize to me personally.  It's
a long story, but I did not have snail mail delivery for 35 days and they had
lost some of my mail.   This man was intelligent, helpful and we worked out
all the problems.  He send a mail carried to my door several times to
personally get my mail through.  The mail carrier was also nice.  

The post master said the problem was the centralized mail system and
explained how his works "stupid it was" to get orders form far off
supervisors.  He told me that he was going to ignore the memorandums  that
caused my mail to stop.   To me this just proves the de-centralization of
centralization works.  The local government employees are nicer and get
things done better than the nameless, faceless state and federal levels.   

You might think I like the post office?  No,  they just destroyed a package
of mine and don't want to pay the insurance on it.  The local post office
employee I talked to was really (expletive deleted ) to me.  And, they wonder
why people use UPS.

As James said >>a small power trip for the federal worker involved.>>

I agree with James that many federal employees are "not capable or competent
enough to get a job in the private sector".   There are a few who are,  Dr.
Doug King (USDA)  but it's the bad ones that most people see.

<James>  Anyone who is any good quits and works for the private sector. >>

Yes,  this happens most of the time.  My clients offer jobs to the good ones.
 Their is a young microbiologist working for the FDA right now, I would like
to hire.

< James>  The federal  government is the employer of last resort.>>

I asked an FDA manager if I could get a job with the FDA.  He said "Yes, but
knowing you, you wouldn't want it.  You would be frustrated all the time with
the stupidity and go right back into the private sector."   

<James> People are promoted based on seniority, not
 qualification.  The cream does not rise to the top in the federal
government.
 And people wonder why so many government agencies are mismanaged.>>

They are also promoted on how much positive publicity they can generate for
the agency,  like nailing someone to the cross.

<James>  That said, there are a few agencies in the government who have their
act
 together, but they are far and few between.  I think many government
 employees need to be reminded that they work for *us*.  >>

The USDA was "taken down" a notch in my book after they knowingly let
_Salmonella_ into Chicago area milk from Jewel Food's processing plant Hill
Farms.  The top managers were informed of the problem by the local USDA
inspectors who recommended plant shut down.  (The _local_ inspectors had the
right answer).   The managers said "But, we can't shut them down because they
would go out of business.  We would be looked at as the bad guys for laying
off so many people.  The the public and congress would have a field day."   

Well,  they still have a field day because over 100,000 people got
_Salmonella_ food poisoning and 12 people died.  Even "good" Government
agencies don't work right in some very major incidents.  

All the better to privatize and de-centralize.

If the U.S. Navy routinely conducts missile tests in or sufficiently near
the direct flight paths of commercial airliners, and the safety of the
airlines depends solely on someone in the Navy picking up the phone and
talking to someone at the FAA, then I would certainly admit this could have
happened.

However, I would like to see some credible evidence that this is how it is
done.  While Navy documents are not generally made public, I believe FAA
documents are.

Finally, I would think there would be no one more anxious to exonerate TWA
than TWA.  (The aircraft manufacturer -- was it Boeing? -- would be a close
second.)  Has TWA commented on this theory?  Wouldn't they know whether
Navy missile tests sometimes take place in this area?  Would they have a
reason to cover-up a mistake made by the Navy -- a mistake that caused
great harm to their business?

Do you believe TWA is part of the conspiracy?  If not, I am willing to call
their media relations department next week and see what they say.

No hard feelings at this end, Ian.  I really don't think I have been
attacking you; that has certainly never been my intent.

Even if I do sometimes ridicule the idea that A = -A (which I do), remember
I am ridiculing an *idea*.

This reminds me of the arguments by Hans Moravec, developed in more
detail in Frank Tipler's Physics_of_Immortality, that future people will be
able and motivated to create lifelike simulations of the past, and that
therefore we may well be living in such simulations.  In fact Moravec even
argues that since these simulations may be run many times (possibly
infinitely many) while the reality only happens once, that we are much
more likely to be in a simulation than a reality.  You could also argue
that the simulations will cover many possible worlds and not just the one
real world, and therefore for similar reasons our chances of being in a
simulation are greater.

These models raise the same question about lack of intervention by the
outsiders in the worlds they create.  On the one hand, if they intervene
it messes up the simulation and they may not learn what they wanted to
from it.  But on the other, intervention would provide a new source of
information, and can also be justified on grounds of kindness, as Tipler
does at length.

I have prayed to the forces that run this universe, but there has been no
response.  On the one hand you have to expect this because at least some
of the time they would run it without intervention; but on the other, you
would also expect that sometimes they would intervene.  Of course they
might intervene in other ways independent of prayer, but I would guess that
moments of prayer would be more likely to receive interventions than others
since that is when attention is being directed towards the outside actors
and so intervention could bring more dramatic results.

We are faced with the classic dilemma of self-splitting: given that two
events are both going to happen, to different instances of yourself, what
is the proper expectation to hold with regard to your future experiences?
I find it most reasonable to take a probabilistic view, and to expect to
experience the two choices in proportion to the percentage of runs which
will experience one versus the other.  So the lack of perceived intervention
would imply that many more non-intervening runs are made over a given
moment of consciousness than intervening ones.

I'm on your side, David.  I'm not a dogmatic atheist.  I'm a 
creedal minimalist.  Maybe you haven't been on the list long enough 
to be aware that I'm something of an outsider here.  When I refer to 
"Extropians," I don't necessarily include myself.  The fact that I don't 
hold religion in contempt is one thing that separates me from 
Extropians. 

I agree with much of what you say.  I particularly like the fact that you 
didn't say God was omnipotent or omniscient.  In fact, I meant to 
pick up on something Chris Hind said, and start a similar thread myself, 
but you beat me to it.  

I can't say much about this right now.  Theology requires a level of 
logical/metaphysical acumen that is beyond my grasp in my present 
feverish state.   I can talk about rudeness, but God is a bit more difficult.  
However, I do want to make a couple of comments.  
1.  One of the worst mistakes one can make in this field is to assume 
that God is a "hypothesis."  God isn't a hypothesis any more than 
objective reality is a hypothesis.  
2.   A point of eristic strategy:  in a field were arguments easily 
degenerate into semantic arguments, it is a good idea to invent new 
terminology instead of using words that carry a lot of baggage, 
such as the G-word.

Robin Hanson, in his very interesting "Great Filter" essay
about our prospects for expanding into the universe <URL:
http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html >, mentions in passing
an argument which I have heard only a little about:

> Note that this cause for concern has a different basis than the simple
> statistical arguments of Gott [Gott 93] and Leslie [Leslie 96] that all
> else equal we shouldn't expect many more future humans than there have
> been past humans.

I wonder if this argument makes sense to people.  I apologize for discussing
it without having read the original but hopefully I have the gist of it
right.  The idea is that, given a person chosen at random, chances are that
he will be average in most ways.  In particular, he will be about average
in terms of when he lives in the grand scope of human history.

If we graph human population over time, and assume for simplicity that the
resulting total human population is finite, then the average person's
time of living can be found by multiplying each era by the population of
that era, adding these up, and dividing by the total human population.
In other words, the average person will live at a time when the total
number of people who have lived before him will be about the same as the
total number who have lived after him.

Now we take the step of taking ourselves as our randomly chosen people.
Applying the argument, we conclude that approximately as many people will
live after us as have lived before us.  Because of the recent increase
in population, it follows that there can't be many years left for humanity
because most of the people who have ever lived are alive now.  Our time
seems to be about up.

Maybe I'm not telling it right, but this argument seems quite weak to me.
First, I don't accept the notion that each person can view himself as a
randomly chosen individual.  There has been no selection procedure such
as we normally think of in random choice.  Rather, each person throughout
history has his own conciousness.  And in fact I seem to be not at all
random even compared to people in my own time.  I live in one of the richest
countries in the world; even among such people I have attended some of the
finest schools in the country; my interests and abilities are extremely
unusual.

Looking at it in Bayesian terms, I am going to live out my lifetime here,
this year, whether the human race self destructs in a few years or not.
Both outcomes are equally consistent with my life experience.  So I don't
see how the knowledge that I am alive should cause me to change my
estimate of the likelihood of these two outcomes.

Even if we accept this probability argument, there is then the question
of what the sampling pool is.  Is the argument consistent with a transition
to a post-human stage in the near future?  Could we say that the argument
validly predicted the end of the human race, but that the ending is actually
a transition to another stage?  Just how much of a transition is necessary
for the argument to retain its force?  I don't see any way to answer these
questions.  If there are no answers then I think the argument is invalid.

I actually have another idea which answers the argument on its own terms.
Think in terms of the Moravec/Tipler picture where humanity lives
forever but spends a lot of time simulating the past.  Then Gott's
argument would suggest that the "average" person should be from the
era most simulated.

What is the most interesting period to simulate?  Why, the Transition,
of course: those brief millenia when we went from being paleolithic
cavemen to posthuman gods.  So naturally they'd look at that over and
over again.  And our era is probably high on the list, the first age when
we began to realize what is happening.  Even among our era, those people
most simulated would be those who became aware of the great changes in
store for them, such as Extropians.  And the moments which would be most
simulated would be when they were actually thinking and communicating
these ideas... just as we are now.

Yes, but these polymers are not in a liquid water environment.  At that
temperature, I believe liquid water would be required to be supercritical.
Supercritical water doesn't just break down organics, it usually oxidizes
them to the greatest extent possible, with the exception of Nitrogen due to
the relatively low temperature.  I've seen supercritical reactors operating
at 550 C that turned ANY organic material into carbon dioxide, water, and
inorganic salts.  It is currently gaining very large favor as a new method
of destroying organic waste, toxic and otherwise.

Yeah, I tried to really simplfy it, as it had been first explained to me

How do you define very little explosive?  With the Sea Sparrow, you are
looking at about 35 kilos of military high explosive.  Compare this to the
fact that most airline terrorist incidents are accomplished with less than 1
kilo.

True, a proximity detonation would leave little residue, but as I mentioned
above, proximity-fused missiles leave very distinct damage signatures on
aircraft.  A person familiar with missile damage could identify what type of
missile and warhead was used simply from the visible damage to the aircraft.
This type of damage would have been immediately apparent on the fuselage.
Even to someone who wasn't familiar with missile damage, it would have been
readily apparent that something unusual happened to the fuselage from the
outside.

Assuming the plane was shot down by a missile launched from a boat *other*
than a Navy one also generates some difficulties.  The missile capabilities
required to shoot down the jet in the given conditions requires an
intermediate range missile.  A shoulder-launched weapon has neither the
range nor the capability required.  Your average intermediate range
anti-aircraft missile is pretty large (3-5 meters long) and usually weighs
between 400-800 pounds.  Add to this the fairly bulky launching equipment,
and the requirements for a launch platform get pretty large.  Most
low-intermediate range anti-aircraft missiles use passive or semi-active
radar (such as the Sea Sparrow).  This requires that someone is guiding the
missile to the target using anti-aircraft radar equipment.  The bottom line
is that for someone else *other* than the Navy to use such a missile system
would mean some SERIOUS ship retrofitting and hardware acquisitions.  I
imagine it is pretty difficult to purchase an anti-aircraft radar system
over-the-counter, never mind the launcher and missiles.  

The alternative, although less likely, is infrared-guided missiles.
Infrared guided missiles require significantly less supporting hardware.
However, infrared-guided missiles would have caused severe mechanical damage
to the engines.  No damage of this type was found.

Despite "eye witnesses", I still have serious problems with the missile
theory based on the evidence given.  However, if a missile is required, the
Navy would be the only real viable source.

        Indeed.  I think we should have a definition of 'atheist'.  I
consider myself an atheist because I don't believe in a conventional  'God'.
I am very open to other thoughts however, and the general term of
atheist has a synonym of 'closed-minded'.  Go figure.

        It still doesn't change the meaning, though.  'God' is short and
convenient to use, as well as widely known.  I don't see the reason for
creating a new word for this.

As most entertainment is based on new experiences for the individual,
and that most individuals in a transhuman society would live in a
relative lap of luxury, I would conclude that the most frequently
simulated periods would be the primitive ones, those would induce
hardship of all kinds, most of which have or will have dissapeared from
the "real" human existence.

Regarding the discussion of explosive residue, here's 
a logical answer: 

Explosives residue was found, but they said it was from 
the time when the plane (1) was used to ferry munitions 
during the gulf war and (2) was used for bomb sniffing 
dog training. If we are to believe this, the plane is 
neutralized with respect to bomb residue evidence.

But more important, at my web site on the topic I've pieced 
together the case for missile kill leaving no explosives residue: 

        FACT 12: While investigators claim that there is no
        evidence that a missile or bomb exploded inside the
        plane, information was leaked to the AP that a train-
        ing guided missile with no warhead that locks onto 
        the center-of-mass may have passed through the plane 
        without exploding. Such a missile would leave two big
        clues: (a) the missile would strike "the center fuel
        tank, touching off the explosion," and it (b) "would  
        only leave a small hole." Associated Press (09/22/96).

        FACT 13: (a) "The explosion that brought down TWA 
        Flight 800 occurred in the center fuel tank area,
        the lead investigator [said]." Reuter (08/22/96).

        FACT 14: (b) Investigators reconstructing the debris 
        say there is a hole going into the plane and a hole 
        going out of the plane. Associated Press (09/23/96):

                ...a source...said on condition of 
                anonymity.... ``There's metal bent 
                in, metal bent out. Metal you can't 
                tell. I see a hole going in and a 
                hole going out...''

There it is, the necessary clues for what happened minus residue.

Theists claim to know there are one or more gods.  Atheists claim to
know there are none.  I call myself an agnostic because I claim I
don't know, and a doctrinaire agnostic because I claim that nobody
else can possiblyknow either.  But my anti-dogma dogma has its limits.

I spent about 15 minutes Tuesday trying to convince a neoPagan New-Age
                                                   * * * *

                                                   * * * *
years of meditation, when it dawned on me that 1) we could go on like this
indefinitely and only raise our blood pressure, and 2) as long as I didn't
make an ego battle of it, what she _thought_ didn't matter as much to the
quality of my life as what she _did_.  When that light went on, I said,
"Now that you know all that, what will you do?", and she said (loosely) "My
life's work is now to work with the Habitat for Humanity helping homeless
families build homes for themselves.".  Suits me fine, cosmology or no
cosmology.  We parted amicably.  So I guess I'm a pragmatic agnostic as well.

I have to disagree here.  I think that if there were many individuals 
with their own plants, it would be unrealistic to think that none of
them would try anything "unethical" to further their own career.  Let's
say only one person tried to get away with dumping waste illegally.  The
opposing businesses have two options:  they can team together and use
their clout to have this man punished, or they might recognize the
profits to made by following suit and use their collective guilt to
hopefully avoid punishment (on a freeway filled with speeding cars, what
are the chances that you of all people will be the one who gets pulled
over?)  In other examples you might be able to pull off the old
"righteousness of the little man" argument, but in this case the people
doing the dumping will have to suffer along with the rest of humanity. 
The fact that they do it anyway is indicative of the fact that most
people, whether small-time entrepreneurs or faceless heads of monolithic
corporations, don't see toxic waste dumping as a matter of ethics.  The
promise of easy money makes them rationalize the dumping on the grounds
that either it's really not that big a problem or else it's a problem
that can easily be taken care of with someone else's time and money.

Hi this is a question.

As a person very interrested in the future i have subscribed to the
etropian mailing list. I receive about 30 postings a day. But i don't quite
get it.
1 thread is about the TWA 800, aka a conspiracy discussion.
1 thread is about the existence of god, aka a basic existensialist question
(at leat part of the thread)
1 thread is about worker/emplyer relationsship, aka govermental influence

These threads consists of more than 50% of all threads.

They seem rather uninterresting to me. Especially as an european. I mean it
seems more like a discussiongroup for a bunch of friends discussing
whatever interrests them. Is this all there is to the mailing list?

There have been some good threads in the digest though.

Kind regards

No, it can be *very* good. I've only recently rejoined the list
(I used to be here as bob_g@eris.demon.co.uk), and it does seem
to have wandered a bit far off-topic at the moment. I think some
of the prime movers are a bit busy on other projects at the moment.

>There have been some good threads in the digest though.
I'm sure it will get back to that form soon. I suppose it's up to
us members to keep it on track. Anyone here read
Matt Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue" yet?
It's about the evolution of cooperation despite it's apparent
contradictions with the 'selfish gene' worldview.
While it covers evolution in general, it homes in on Human 'society'
in particular, and has much to say on our particular kinds of
cooperation and 'selfishenss'. I've only read about 1/3 so far, but
it certainly touches on quite a few Extropian subjects, IMO.

If it has some oxygen dissolved in it, I think. I doubt equilibrium will

Sounds interesting, I did not knew. Does it hydrolyse the dioxines as well?
(The best stuff I knew of, apart from CrO_3 in sulfuric acid, was Carot's 
acid, a hot mix of strong hydrogen peroxide (perhydrole, H_2O_2) and 
conc. sulfuric acid, I remember it dissolved a dead fly tracelessly within 
seconds).

Isn't this the same technology enabling a NAVSTAR GPS receiver to sift 
through several simultaneous sat signals? (in contrast to GLONASS, which is 
conventional). Where's the novelty of the CDMA approach, can you disclose 
a bit more details? Sounds really intriguing, but achieving the same 
signal ratio must involve a feedback loop, to dynamically adjust the 
sender power. What the highest possible talker load on a single 
frequency? Some 10, some 100? 'twould be interesting to learn. The stuff 
operates in GHz range, I presume? Individual channel bandwidth???

Lots of questions, I know...

An vanilla cell phone in Europe has about 5 W peak power. What does CDMA 
average about to? Does this result in nondeterministic battery life time, 
depending on your movement dynamics and EM environment?

4 hours? It's not too sensational.

But CDMA must be just cellular, with a (big) plus. They sure modeled 
expected user load, this must be a bogus argument.

Yeah, I've seen it. A flat box looking a plain cellphone, you open it up 
like an oyster and see a diminuitive qwerty and a graphical LCD. I think 
they're using ARM chips. Btw ARM, have a look at StrongARM (at DEC site), 
it will be part of the next Newton, and some other products.  

> If there is interest, perhaps I can post more on this later...

Yeah, please do. Most extropians like tech things, methinks ;)

Check out the Motorola website (must be http://www.motorola.com), they've 
progressed quite far Iridium-wise (which is just planetwide satellite 
cellular), now they're trying to launch a Internet-thru-space project, a 
number with direct line-of-sight intersat links (wasn't Billie up to 
something similiar?). It will have some ground-located infrastructure as 
well, and targeted to cost about 5 G$, or so. I forgot exact details, 
check out the site.

Is one person's experience all there is of _anything_ (except maybe that
one person's experience)?  Of course not.

That aside, if you don't like the threads you see, toss one out.  If it
has a hook at the end, maybe someone will bite.

I'm sorry that David Musick has apparently taken personal offense at my last
post, I was not trying to insult him, in fact, I believe David has
written some high quality, thought provoking posts lately, I even liked his
"God" post. I don't agree with it, but I thought it was good. Posts I agree
with completely are dull.

It's true, you never used the words "omnipotent" or "omniscient"  but I don't
think you needed to because you used another word "God" and even said it
might explain the ultimate fact of our existence. In modern times the dividing
line between a conscious being who is called God and a conscious being
who is not, is the concept of infinity. Yes, it's just a tradition, and
as you say all tradition should be questioned, but I have come to the
conclusion that this particular tradition is a good one if the word "God" is
to be meaningful. If you keep making God weaker and more vague then obviously
you would eventually reach a point where I would have to agree that God does
exist, but this doesn't seem to be a useful exercise to me.

When I tell people that I am an atheist I've had some respond contemptuously
and say "Oh, so you don't think anything is greater than yourself". Sort of
flattering really, what they're saying is that the only thing greater than me
is God. Bertrand Russell said something relevant to this "Many people are 
willing to abandon the idea of God, but very few are willing to abandon the 
word "God".
                  

                >When we are very advanced, it is likely that we will be able 
                >to create mini-universes (sometimes called "baby universes").  


Yes, it's a possibility, but I see no reason why the beings in such a universe
would have to be our intellectual inferiors.

Another possibility, but it would be a very poor sort of god indeed if He
needed us to help him figure things out. Colleague would be a better word than
God.                             

                >The universes we create would probably develop through 
                >evolution 


But why would we use Darwin's style of Evolution with its horrible random
mutation and natural selection? Evolution by the inheritance of acquired
characteristics was long ago found not to occur in nature. It's too bad, 
it would be a wonderful consolation to know that the muscular body you
worked so hard to develop, would make your children strong too. How splendid
it would be if your offspring were born knowing everything you struggled to
learn during your life. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way in our world,
Shakespeare's daughter had to start from square one and learn how to hold a
pen and make sense from squiggles written on paper, Einstein's son had to
reinvent the wheel and rediscover that 2 +2 = 4.
                             
Besides being less cruel, Lamarck's type of evolution would be much faster 
than Darwinian evolution, that's why social evolution is so much swifter than 
biological evolution.

We may not be the first, but until the evidence suggests otherwise it's wise
to assume the simplest theory as your working hypothesis.

Then why call this being "God"? You must know that it is burdened with 
more baggage than any other word in the English language.

THreads tend to begin as extropian discussions, then if someone is
intent on burying anothers arguments (especially if they use loose
analogies), the discussion tends to spin off like so many pieces of
shrapnel.

If you are still growing, they might work. Otherwise there is a risk that

You could try eating better (if you don't), good nutrition (especially 
protein) increases height. But it might be hard to do much change right 
now, such things take time.

I have heard about methods of lengthening bones by inserting screws into 
them linked by pressuring beams, but it doesn't sound like anything I 
would like to try. 

Unfortunately, I think it is hard to drastically increase height at your 
age, but it is definitely possible to lay the groundwork for greater 
adult muscle mass by training in this period; if you can't get much 
height, why not try breadth?

You are quite right! The usual threads have seemed to be drowned out by these
3 - good observation. 
TWA_ THE CAT IS OUT!! arrives in my mailbox  at least ten times a day...

Most of the time the discussion is on advanced
technology, (and ethical concerns about ), cryonics, communications, AI,
immortality, philosophy, space, 
abundance( or lack of) and resource development, neuro biology, futurist arts
and etc....
  I have learned much from some
of the brilliant minds that are here and the resources 
found here from time to time.

 Then there are "topics" that refuse to die.
Even though to me they seem like either
conundrums, or at best old battles rehashed....
I think maybe a few people feel *very* strongly about
them.

Many of us delete them in the e-box, and check

Actually, the "God" concept that David is proposing would be both at
once. 

It would Omnipotent to the extent that it created everything within this
simulated universe, and could concievably halt, modify, recode, etc to
suit, possibly without the sub-U's inhabitants noticing. Of course were
it running these simulations as computational devices, it would
obviously wish to run them start to finish without interruption, like
any scientist would. It would however be limited in that it could not
interfere in the internal operation during simulation without complying
with the internal rules of that simluation.

It would also be omniscient within that simulation, in that it would
neccessarily have a complete understanding of the entire workings of
that simulation. If it were able to observe the simluation's time
sequence separte from its own temporal progression, it would also know
both the beginning and the end, or any point in between, at the same
time, which would be good for U-prime's computer operating speed.

They would not need to be. That is your own assumption. If we are
capable of eventually reaching this point ourselves, then we would
necessarily be its equals.

If we were eventually able to create pocket universes that exhibited
better computational capability than our own, through better inheritance
of information, then we would be demonstrably the intellectual superior
to the U-Prime.

Yet Social evolution is happening in this universe, even though it took

It IS part of the simulation.

What? John, I thought you were the premier taboo buster around these
parts! Such preconceptions should not burden you. We use the word
"computer" everyday in ways completly divorced from its original meaning
(a job description for a person with a slide rule). Creating a new
definition for God should be an easy step....

Yes, GPS uses a one-way version of CDMA.  However, there are typically just
3 - 5 "mobile transmitters" (satellites), and much less multipath
interference.  Cellular CDMA involves several novelties, including dynamic
power control, "soft" handoffs, "RAKE" receivers, and variable rate speech
encoding.

Unlike conventional cellular systems (both analog and digital), CDMA reuses
all of the frequencies in all of the cells.  A handoff in a conventional
system involves changing frequencies, with a brief loss of audio.  In a
CDMA system, the phone can communicate with two or even three cells
simultaneously.  As these networks mature, there should be fewer calls
dropped due to bungled handoffs, because CDMA is the only system that never
breaks the connection.

RAKE receivers listen for and recombine multipath signals by adding
variable delays to the components.  Instead of interfering with each other,
the compoents now reinforce each other.

And in a conventional cellular network, once a call is in process it
consumes all of its allocated bandwidth, whether or not both parties are
talking at any given moment.  With CDMA, variable speech encoding
"upshifts" the bit rate only during voice activity.  In fairness, the
competing time division multiple access (TDMA) technology claims it will
add this capability later, but it is clearly *much* harder to accomplish in
a TDMA system, because standard time-slot assignment is quite rigid.


I believe the maximum CDMA "talker" load per 1.25 MHz carrier is 40.  At
first, this seems low, as you can fit 41 30-kHz analog channels in the same
space.  But in the classic cellular network, you can only reuse one-seventh
of the channels in each cell.  (You can improve analog reuse, but the same
techniques apply to CDMA, so there is no net gain for analog.)

Yes.  The fraud/conspiracy theory says that once you load up the system,
this control loop will become impossible to control.  However, they ignore
the fact the system is intentionally designed to accommodate only about 50%
of its theoretical capacity.  It is not normally allowed to get close to
"meltdown"  -- assuming such a thing exists.

Yes, both CDMA and TDMA get rid of the hissing and flutter, and both
introduce "quantization noise" as they use lower bit rate encoding.  But
consumer tests have consistently shown that CDMA sounds more like landline
telephone.  In part, this is because the CDMA camp has good
noise-cancelling technology, and in part because of CDMA's power control
and RAKE receivers.  (Fading causes clicking sounds in TDMA systems.)

I don't know the peak power off hand, but I'm sure if you spend all of your
time near cell edges you will use more power.  Still, it will be the
minimal power needed for that type of operation, and a significant savings
over the coarse power control of analog and TDMA systems.

That's not an apples to apples comparison.  The phone I am talking about
runs at 1.9 gigahertz.  The 800 Mhz version gets 72 hours of standby...

...and 5 hours of talk time.  I believe you are comparing it, however, to
special phones with extra-large (or dual?) batteries.  For example, I know
Ericsson has matched the five hours at 800 Mhz, but by using a battery
that's nearly as heavy as the entire CDMA phone *with* battery.

Actually, that was the service provider price.  The CDMA phone itself is
more expensive right now, because there is just one supplier near full
production; but phone prices are subsidized in the U.S.  (I paid $199 for
the phone; Qualcomm's quantity one price is $530).

No, ten times the voice traffic capacity.  Europe's GSM (TDMA) system is
about 2.6 times analog, while the U.S. TDMA technology is barely 2 times
analog, but uses an 8 kbps vocoder with inferior audio (to put it
politely).

CDMA claims 10 - 20 times analog at 8 kbps.  Carriers are reporting 8 - 10
times analog at 13 kbps, which is 3 - 4 times the capacity of European TDMA
(GSM).

Yes.  I should also say something about the CDMA versus Europe's GSM
competition.  (WARNING: The following is considered heresy by the European
telecomm industry.):

In Europe, the next-generation cellular technology was developed by
committee and *mandated* by governments of the participating countries.  In
other words, CDMA is currently illegal for use in European cellular
networks.  The excuse for doing this was to ensure a single system that
worked everywhere in Europe.  After all, Europe's analog systems are all
incompatible, as the reigning philosophy at that time was national
protectionism.

So they created GSM, which originally was Group Special Mobile (in French),
later changed to Global System for Mobile communications.  Personally, I
like to call it Global Socialist Mobile, or Government Standard Mandated.
Regardless of what you call it, and of how it is excused, it represents
merely a shift from national protectionism to continental protectionism.

Please don't take any of this personally; I think Europe is a swell
vacation destination. :-)  Plus, you guys invented Western Civilization,
for which I am sincerely grateful.  (No kidding.)

GSM fans accuse the U.S. of "cowboy capitalism."  I wish that were the
case.  However, it is true the U.S. went from a government-mandated analog
cellular standard to industry-voluntary digital standards (plural).  So,
when the FCC announced it would auction spectrum for a new personal
communications service, we had something like 70 competing standards at
first, and now we are down to 6.  (The other 64 or so didn't attract
sufficient funding.)

I confess that while the European statists did a reasonably good job with
GSM, it is a matter of faith with me that even a somewhat distorted free
market environment is bound to come up with something better.  Actually,
the GSM committee considered CDMA, and I am told Siemens actually argued in
favor of it.  The committee took what they perceived as the low-risk path
-- leave CDMA as a potential "next" next-generation solution.

Meanwhile, in the U.S. we came up with or "own" TDMA system.  Although
developed by industry voluntarily, it is clearly inferior to GSM -- despite
what my friend Craig McCaw claimed.  Some TDMA supporters were clearly
angered that Qualcomm muddied the water by developing a second "standard."
But hey, nobody put a gun to anyone's head to buy into it.

Qualcomm gradually convinced every major cellular manufacturer to license
CDMA.  Even Sweden's Ericsson has a license, although they used a back
alley route, and tried to make it look like an accident.  (They bought 50%
of the British firm Orbitel, who then licensed CDMA for satellite
applications, and then Ericsson bought the other 50%.  Of course, that had
nothing to do with CDMA!)

Umm, what's a "hopane"? Poiuter, please?

And does anyone have a good pointer to up-to-date info on the 
"alternate" DNA coding that was in the press a few years back? I 
don't remember if it was found in hyperthermophilic entities or not, 
but I do seem to recall that it had used a normal "stop" codon to 
code for a protein...

It's my opinion that for the past few days this mailinglist has been
going through a dry spell in terms of scitech subjects. Stick around,
it'll get better. It always does. You'll soon be invited into the

This is a thread which I have REALLY TRIED to get started for QUITE SOME
TIME. There are new technologies being explored which may lead to the
ability for us to manipulate the weather across the globe. The lesser of
the two major climate manipulation technologies can be accomplished by
injecting large amounts of silver nitrate into the I-wall of a hurricane
to dissolve it. The greater of the two is called HAARP. To sum things up,
HAARP is about a military technology being developed in Alaska called
High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in which you could
create artificial satellites that you could bounce signals off of by
heating sections of the atmosphere with a highly focused radiowave beam.
This HAARP technology is in it's infancy so its possible that with a few
breakthroughs in amplifying the power of the highly-focused radio beam,
that we could ultimately control global climate by heating sections of
the atmosphere in patterns to move moisture around. Technology like this
could be used for the benefit of mankind by dissolving hurricanes before
they make contact with coastlines or moving rain clouds into drought
areas but it can also be used as an incredible weapon which is surely the
reason for the US defense department having a hand in the development.
Imagine if during the Gulf War we had the power to turn Iraq into an
inland sea by using a technology like HAARP to create major flooding and
literally destroy the country? Can we forsee ourselves manipulating
global climate in, lets say the next 20 years? Is the United States
responsible enough to use this type of power for the good of the people?
Saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives? What possible side
effects could occur? Should we take the risk?

In addition to my Global Climate Manipulation & Control thread which I
<bold>REALLY REALLY HOPE</bold> receives replys this time I was also
considering the thought of the near-term future of warfare, such as say a
decade (no nano, or AI perversion attacks). I watched "Eraser" for the
first time yesterday and I began wondering about the prospects of
railguns. Are they feasible? I remember from reading "Snow Crash" that
they were able to puree a boat with a high-speed railgun. Also for those
of you living on the west coast of the United States, remember the
blackout that occurred twice in seven states and the press never fully
explained the reason or went indepth? The military have already
considered the idea of creating electromagnetic pulse pipebombs to
knockout communications and electricity and experimenting a physically
harmless device on the populous wouldn't be that bad so why not black out
seven states? What about soldiers being equipped with augmented reality
displays to enable them to see in infrared, and nightvision or a combo of
both superimposed on each other for maximum vision? I'm sure developments
such as these will eventually be commercialized and drift down to the
masses. To recap, are railguns physically possible? Would the military
experiment on us like that? and was that 7 state blackout really an EMP
pipebomb? Welcome to the new era in Information Warfare!!

For those who haven't read it yet: I highly recommend The Truth Machine by
James Halperin. He's an extropian and has written a fascinating book about
the development and effects of a machine that can tell with certainty
whether someone is telling the truth.

You can order it via the web from amazon.com

He has another, highly extropian novel in the works, which I won't say
anything about, but you should look out for it. It may become a classic in
extropian circle...

Chris, I think one of the reasons that you haven't gotten much response on 
this one is that it's not something we Extropians/Transhumans are likely to 
be able to do much about because it's something that would have to be 
coordinated by governments on a global scale.  Also, it's unlikely that any 
government is going to try and control the weather (except, perhaps, the 
hurricane stuff you mention) without some major breakthrough or disaster - 
governments just aren't very innovative or daring, especially since 
improving the weather in one place is likely to have adverse side effects 
somewhere else.  Furthermore, our weather and climate models, while 
steadily improving, are still full of a huge number of unknowns.  We 
probably need alot more satellites and other sensors in place to monitor 
the weather before we could begin to play around with it.

On the positive side, as VR and augmented reality become more widespread, 
we might see interactive, weather-manipulation simulations become popular, 
which would probably increase our knowledge of and appreciation for weather 
control enough so that there might be some popular push to get governments 
to perform more experiments.

Nothing _very_ interesting, I'm afraid... It's just the evolutionary 
precursor to the steroid molecule (that pesky cholesterol is a steroid, 
most hormones (testosterone, progesterone) are steroids, as well), only 
hopane has a six-membered-ring, where steroid has a five-membered-ring. 
Nothing spectacular, just a minor optimization.

Anyway, hopane has gone out of use, only in microfossils & other old 
organic stuff can hopane traces be found. Afaik, no critter alive uses is 
anymore.

Wait for new display technology (TI's DLP will probably qualify, yet look 
for current MDM beamer prices. Extrapolate using vanilla learning curve, I 
see many years yet.) Wait for reliable trackers (have a look at i-glasses 
tracking tech). Wait for LPS (local positioning system) infrastructure 
installed everywhere (I suggest ultrasonic beakons, GPS technology in 
audio range). 

Well, it ain't exactly round the corner.

Ack. AR=Augmented Reality<>Artifical Reality. Of course, augmented

A related note (not specific to David Musick or John Clark)...

I joined this list hoping it would prove an island of enlightenment.  I
don't mean a place where everyone agrees with *me* -- I mean a place where
people are committed to progress and willing to thoroughly test out new
ideas.  That requires beating the !#%! out of ideas without getting
personally bent out of shape.

Hey, if you can make my ideas look foolish because you have more/better
information or have attained a higher level of intellectual development, go
right ahead.  You are helping me.  While I prefer you dispense a little
encouragement to me as you tear my pet theories to shreds, doing so is
purely optional.

Unfortunately, in the short time I have been here I have witnessed at least
three incidents in which people have stormed out of debates saying "If
that's the only way you can discuss this, let's not discuss it at all!"

Yes, ad hominem arguments prove nothing.  They deserve to be exposed and
dispensed with.  So just do it.  But truly enlightened thinkers are not so
easily wounded.

Upward!, Outward!...

...And get over it already, OK?

Well i *complained* about the threads on the mailing list and was told make
start my own so i wil try to do that. 

I'll start out with a scenario and end up with a question.

SCENARIO
1) Computers wil obtain intelligence/autonomity either by traditional top
down AI methods (like the CYC project), or because all of the autonomous
processes on the net wil somehow reach a state of conciousness through
shear complexity. Maybe they wil achieve autonomity by some other mean it
doesn't really matter. What matters is that they will able to support and
develop themself without human assistance.
2) It is to expensive to send a lot of humans to space or there is no
political will to do it, and private organisations don't have the means  to
do it. The most reasonable way to expect space exploration  to get underway
is by planting a seed of autonomous robots somewher with enough energy and
raw materials for them to replicate. (moon, asteroids, whatever) All of it
computersimulated beforehand of course.
3) The robots with their endless patience and practically infinite
lifespans will then start exploring space in a logarithmic way. (You know
breeding new offspring as they arive to new energy sources and mining
areas.) They will start by mining the solar system then the nearest stars
and so on. (Hopefully they will leave some raw materials for us in this
solar system) In the end they will conquer space. All without us. They will
be offspring of the human race. Robo Sapiens. This makes us less important
in the long run. Until we don't mean a thing in the big picture.
Off course we can develop ourself by integrating with technology the
cyberpunk way, but they can do it so much faster than us.

QUESTION
Does the scenario hold and what is the reason then for us as biological
beings to go to space and live eternal lives? (Not counting the obvious
reason to fight the robots for raw materials ;-) )

I hope this isn't a discussion done with a long ago.

Well i think the weather is to imprecise for us to controll. It's to big a
mechanism. It's a bit like curing cancer with chemo therapy. overall you
maybe can make things work but you kill of a lot of healthy cells in the
process. That can be a bit of a problem when the weather is the cancer and
humans are the healthy cells. It would be a PR nightmare at least.

And what about the ice age. Recent findings from the inlandic ice on
Greenland shows that a new ice age can pop up within as little as 20 years.


Instead of changing the enviroment as we do now when we look at the small
scale, wouldn't it be better to adapt to it. If we can imagine building big
O'Neill type space stations in orbit, and the colonialisation of Mars,
couldn't we imagine doing similar things here on earth. (there's still a
lot of parcels available in Sahara ;-) )

Well i think that a good way to look at the future of warfare is to look at
what happens in something like QUAKE the game. Kids are programming bots in
somthing called quakeC using neural nets fuzzy logic and what have you. The
reaperBot 0.7 is especially hard to beat. It learns quickly from it's
mistakes. Off course they have to die a few times before they get really
good. But thats not really to unrealistic as any real *Terminator* would
most likely be able to transfer their experinces to the great wireless
Teminator network before they fade away completely.
The Bots in quake of course has an extremely simple universe to traverse so
not everything can be translated to real life. But the logic of things is:

1) someone develops a bot. The bot soon gets a LOT better than the human
players.
2) this destroys the game for the human players so they develop bodyguard
Bots
3) Each player controls a certain amounts of bots so it gets to be a more
tactical game than an action game.

Imagine future warfare where each human soldier control a flock of robots,
possibly by telepresence, and he with the best and most robots wins the
battle. I think this is the most likely way for future warfare to go. Off
course there will always be weapons that uses the battleaxe style instead
of the scalpel style that robotic warfare represents.
just look at it from a PR and political viewpoint. A Robowar will be
relatively inexpensive(none of our boys got lost) and hi tech war material
is always cool on the tube.

Danish SF writer Niels E. Nielsen has written some good books that touches
the subject. I don't know what their english title is.

We allready got loads of massdestrucion capability. therefore i think that
the development will be in precision and minimizing the number of
casualties on *our* side.

The problem with rail guns is not the size of the rail. You can build
one the size of a pistol to give equivalent muzzle velocity. The problem
is in the power supply. TO give sufficient gauss, with current capacitor
technology, you would need a backpack full to get enough power for a few
blasts, plus a power supply to "reload".

With EMP weapons, these are possible, though you need to place your
weapon in very close proximity to avoid inverse squared dissipation,
unless you created a special focused device that used two transmitters
to create scalar zones. I invented one of these to work with my radar
detector against cops while I was in the Air Force. THe US DOD now owns
the designs......  ;-)

HAARP is going to be the Area 51 of the 21st century.  It will have all
sorts of things ascribed to it, a few of which will be true, the rest
will be pure bogosity.

Even though AR can be done with superimposing 2 2D images the VR style, we
will probably still need holographics for it to completely fool the eyes.
The 2D way don't quite work on our wetwork.

For better or worse, I don't think climate or weather manipulation is
going to be possible for quite some time.  In particular, I don't think
HAARP has anything to do with weather control.  Crackpots all over the
net have been accusing this project of being about everything from mind
control to UFO communications.  I won't rule out the possibility that there
is more to the project than is public knowledge, but there is so much
garbage about HAARP out there that I view any claims about it on the net
with major skepticism.

The ionosphere which HAARP is apparently studying is very thin, nearly
a vacuum by normal standards.  I don't think it is at all likely to be
a way to control the weather.  Its electromagnetic properties are much
more interesting from the point of view of communications and sensing,
and I think that is enough to explain the military's interest.

The thing is, weather is a big, big phenomenon.  If you want to
control it by brute force, you will need hugely massive amounts of
energy, many orders of magnitude (powers of 10) beyond what we can
manipulate now.  Alternatively you can try to use fine tuning control,
taking advantage of the chaotic dynamics of the system.  There have
been a lot of demonstrations recently of controlling chaotic systems,
and conceivably these ideas could apply to weather.  However for these
to work you need to have a very accurate picture of your system, and
you need to be able to predict where it is going in the short term,
as well as where it would go if you tweak it.

So we need better computers, and more importantly we need a global system
for monitoring the atmosphere in detail.  These both will be along
eventually, but it's going to be a while.  A spinoff from this will be
very accurate weather forecasts at least over the short term.  They will
probably need to be able to predict how much rain each house will get
over the next 24 hours, something like that level of accuracy.  Then
they can try seeing if tiny perturbations can give control.  It's going
to be a big and very exciting task.

Once this is achieved, conceivably weather warfare will become possible.
However countermeasures may be possible as well.  Given that the enemy
is using microscopic tweaks to lead to big effects based on his models,
you can confound him by counter-tweaks.  This presupposes a certain amount
of parity between the opponents; without that then sure, one side will
have an advantage, just like with other forms of warfare.

IAN: Logical points. If one does not like the threads, there are 
two easy things to do, 1) delete them, 2) offer some alternatives.
The least appropriate, it seems to me, is to complain to the list,
in effect acting as some kind of authority telling people: "Stop
talking about what you all want to talk about and start talking
about I want to talk about."

The two options enumerated are free-market approaches, the latter
inappropriate approach is an authoritarian regulator approach.
No insult intended, that's just how I see it.

TWA might have paid attention to what happened to Pan American Air Lines.

Remember Pan Am?

Here is the *unverified* story I heard of how Pan Am ceased to exist:

After Pan Am's flight is blown up over Scotland, Pan Am hires their own
investigators, who conclude that the flight (which contained many
high-ranking CIA operatives) was blown up by members of a different group of
CIA operatives, as part of an intra-agency power struggle.  

Pan Am files suit in federal court asking for damages from the CIA.

Next thing you know, Pan Am's lines of credit are withdrawn, they are
declared bankrupt, and the court-appointed bankrupcy trustee withdraws the suit.

If this is true, there should be some traces in the historical record, and
the message would not be lost on TWA...

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I think I'm having a definition problem here. Perhaps a few of the more 
optimistic out there can enlighten me.

My dictionary describes optimism as - Leibniz's doctrine that the world 
is the best of all possible worlds: a belief that everything is ordered 
for the best: a disposition to take a bright, hopeful view of things: 
hopefulness

The first definition can't be extropian. Why, then, all the posts about 
improving the human condition? 

My perception of the shared extropian belief system (BS) is that there is 
an optimism about the future. Not necessarily optimism about the present. 
Guatemala? Bosnia? Zaire? Liberia? China? Russia? Urban America? Mexico? 
Myanamar? Tibet? Taiwan? Chechnya? Korea? Perhaps this is all part of the 
order that leads to the Best of All Possible Worlds.

The 3rd definition I embrace as a remarkably effective psychological 
tool. When I notice paranoia creeping in I flip it to metanoia to see 
what it looks like.(It's a conspiracy, man. I tell you these guys are out 
to _help_ me!)
But it is one of many tools and dispositions.

IMO, we all have hopes that we cherish. Even confidence that we will all 
one day see a better world for ourselves, our friends, our families, our 
loved ones. Expectations that we will one day challenge and conquer 
Unreasoning Death.

But, it's still nothing more than hope.

So, my questions are; What is your defintion of optimism? What role does 
optimism play in Extropian Philoshphy? Is there such a thing as too much 
optimism? What about when optimism turns into blind faith, or 
unreasonable hopes? If this were a *game* and optimism was an attribute, 
how would you value it against other attributes? Would it be more 
valuable or less than diplomacy, charisma, strength or Machivellian 
wiliness?

A related note (not specific to David Musick or John Clark)...

I joined this list hoping it would prove an island of enlightenment.  I
don't mean a place where everyone agrees with *me* -- I mean a place 
where
people are committed to progress and willing to thoroughly test out new
ideas.  That requires beating the !#%! out of ideas without getting
personally bent out of shape.

Hey, if you can make my ideas look foolish because you have more/better
information or have attained a higher level of intellectual development, 
go
right ahead.  You are helping me.  While I prefer you dispense a little
encouragement to me as you tear my pet theories to shreds, doing so is
purely optional.

Unfortunately, in the short time I have been here I have witnessed at 
least
three incidents in which people have stormed out of debates saying "If
that's the only way you can discuss this, let's not discuss it at all!"

Yes, ad hominem arguments prove nothing.  They deserve to be exposed and
dispensed with.  So just do it.  But truly enlightened thinkers are not 
so
easily wounded.

Upward!, Outward!...

...And get over it already, OK?


(Thanks Ira)

To sum up-
Just what the hell is Dynamic Optimism? How does it help you? Is it 
genetic or can you learn it? Did you learn it? If so, how? How would you 
go about teaching someone to be dynamically optimistic?

Love,
David D.

I too have noticed the overabundance of impulsive, non-quality posting and 
idle chit-chat in this forum.  I do my best to try and post high-quality, 
interesting posts, and I avoid responding to things unless I can somehow work 
my ideas into a high-quality, interesting post.

To me, Extropy is very realated to the concepts of quality and excellence, and 
as a practicing Extropian, I work to acheive quality and excellence in 
everything I do.  From the way I wash my hands to the way I write, I practice 
acheiving quality and excellence in all of the little and big areas of my 
life.

If we are truly Extropians, and if this is really a forum for Extropian 
discussion, we should make all our exchanges with each other through this 
forum as extropic as possible.  There are plenty of other mailing lists and 
discussion groups where people can engage in idle chit-chat and send impulsive 
messages to each other, but I feel it is innappropriate in this particular 
forum.  We are Extropians.  Lets act like it.

I do my best to seed this forum with high quality posts and well-thought-out 
ideas.  I wish there were more people contributing excellent posts to this 
forum.  I wish I could read the mail from the Exi list and have it overflowing 
with interesting and thought-provoking ideas, rather than a lot of idle 
banter.  If you don't have something to write that you think will truly be 
interesting to those who read in this forum, please don't write anything; just 
read for a while, and then when you have something interesting you want to 
share, write it up well and then post it.

We can make this one of the best, most extropic mailing lists on the Internet, 
but we must learn *discipline*.  And we must be committed to posting only 
good, quality writings.  As more people join this forum, the need for this 
will become more appearent, especially if one receives a few hundred messages 
a day, full of idle chit-chat about some inane topic.

I've noticed that as I strive to write quality writings, the quality of my 
typical thoughts also rises.  My quality writings are an excercise for my 
mind, to develop high quality, very articulate thinking.  I urge the 
contributers to this list to practice writing high-quality writings.  It's 
very good for developing one's mind.

Well, consider Ray Peck's comment last Wednesday:

I have some threads in the works that should generate some sparks 
(for example  - "The Fuzzy Logic of Race"), but I am disheartened 
at the prospect of going around the same predictable circles, yet again.  
These discussions have no structure and arrive at no conclusion.  
"Wildgrowing" is an apt description.  

On the other hand, even wildgrowing threads bear fruit.  I certainly 
agree that the TWA flight has been beaten to death, but even here an 
interesting point emerged.  I was struck by Mike Lorrey's statement 

> I was the key witness in a case in which two female airmen

and truly taken aback by James Rogers's confirmation,

Wow.  I would never have been aware that this was happening 
if I hadn't taken the trouble to follow this prolix thread.  I have 
given up on the list as a philosophical forum but it still has its uses.  
As David Musick wrote tonight, 

> My quality writings are an excercise for my mind, to develop 
> high quality, very articulate thinking.  

Yep.  The way to be a writer is to write, and this is as good a place 
as any to practice.  But there is no use doing this (or anything else) 
halfway.  Posts written without discipline are a waste of everybody's 
time, not least the writer's.  (But of course everybody will think 
this latter remark must apply to someone other than himself.)  

Whatever Extropians think, there is such a thing as real art, and 
there are real standards of logical structure and cogency in prose.  
In the absence of an editor to set and enforce such standards, 
Gresham's law will ultimately prevail.    

Bob Grahame writes, 

> Anyone here read Matt Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue" yet?  

I saw an excerpt from it in FT and have been eagerly awaiting 
its appearance in the bookstores.  From the little bit I read, this is 
definitely something that has not been rehashed 12 times.

While I choose the latter, it appears you choose the former, since,

It doesn't really matter who or what become the new specie to 
populate and explore space, as long as its done.  From my layman's 
point of view of artificial life and genetic engineering, I see the 
strongest race to ascension between these two technologies.  Since 
the organisms born out of these projects will compete for the same 
niche, I'd guess that it'll be one or the other that survives.

At the moment the only organism that I can control and engineer to my 
specifications is  * "me", and that's enough of a challenge for now 
:-)

* "me" is a system of patterns extending into thousands of realities, 
probing and integrating new information which it then feeds back into 
the system, a cosmic-transistor channeling high energy chaos into a 
living form.

Yes, usually there is little I can argue with in them, so although I find 
them fun to write they are dull to read, but that's your burden not mine. 
In a few instances however (just a few) I think that John Clark has grossly 
oversimplified, glossed over important issues, and been downright rude.  
I've had a strong urge to send a post to that pompous windbag and give him
a piece of my mind, so far I have managed to restrain myself from doing so. 
I was afraid people would think me a little strange.

I don't get why they have to be mutually-exclusive.

I studied holography (part-time) for a couple of years.  As I remember, it
has many applications including information storage,  security, image
recognition, and diagnosing mechanical stresses.

It's also possible that holography will play a key role in augmented
reality.  One of my favorite holograms is one that projects the image of a
microscope into the space directly in front of the film.  When you walk up
to the image, you can actually look through the lens of the microscope and
see the magnified object!

That reminds me of another potential application of holography:
lightweight, high-power lenses that can be rolled up and transported into
space in poster-mailer tubes.

Actually, I think dynamic optimism is not all that new.  It is Dale
Carnegie.  It is "est".  It is Carlos Casteneda.  But most of all, it is
common sense.

The question of whether it is learned or genetic is an interesting one.

I believe it is learned, but not the same way you learn Japanese or calculus.

To really understand dynamic optimism requires a high degree of
receptivity.  In my experience, most people are only receptive to such
ideas for brief periods during their lives.

Although est was a cult, it did offer a grain of truth.  To "get it," you
had to be willing to reexamine your entire perspective and approach to
life.  At least as far as personal relationships go, much skepticism is due
to constant replaying in your mind of a video tape containing past,
negative experiences.

I don't think dynamic optimism = blind optimism, however.  And I can't
prove it is not a religion.  But I don't see that it matters.

The key lesson is that life continually presents positive opportunities.
Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of
skepticism.

I agreed with your post , some form of D.O is included  
in well thought out philosophies (dragging in Carlos
Casteneda confused me a bit because from what 
I have heard from Casteneda people, there is a 
mysticism and magic, something about hidden doors,
reality not being real, and energy leaks throughout the
body- ie: a whole lot of mumbo jumbo that I could
hardly follow; - )

>>Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of
skepticism.

Here I agree with the premise... but...
The thing I would change: is say, rather than skepticism, 
"err on the side of *pessimism* " OR err by
"beating one's self up".

Skepticism and optimism work REALLY well together. 
A good dose of both and one will avoid many pitfalls.

The true skeptic is open minded. I know that cynics and
skeptics look much the same, but it is a totally different
mind set ; )

Dynamic (ever changing) and Optimistic (looking at, 
expecting, the best) are best achieved by being
*very good to one's self*, a lesson that  the most
intelligent of us often overlook in the quest
for being "right" or perfect.

Max More has some great insights on this. Even, I
I believe, a well developed curriculum on D.O.

Maybe he could be inticed to post a minimized

Well i don't disagre with the idea that robots eventually will be able to
beat us hands down in any future war. But if robots start to rebel against
us what is there to stop us in developing new robots that will be on our
side (Using something like the three laws of robotics.)?
They will have all the advanteges that the other robots will have plus what
we can add.

WHile I would not terms this as "cheap" space flight, if their engines
actually work on a launcher, it would be less expensive than current
systems.  People don't realize this, but it takes as much energy to get
into low earth orbit as it does to fly to Australia from New York. Given
this, and allowing for the different performance regieme of a space
vehicle, true "cheap" space transporation would be tickets to orbit at
$2000-$5000 per person.  Instead, we've got a government screwed up
system that makes $1000 a pound seem like a bargain.

        Interesting.  My dictionary describes it as: "Inclination to look on
the best side of life or to expect success" something I agree with
whole-heartedly.  *Dynamic* optimism means optimism that has force behind
it.  As dynamic optimists, extropians tend to try to attain progress rather
than sit back and say "Gee, there will be progress some day."  We make our
potential kinetic.

        I'm sure lots of people have sent off responses while I am writing
this, but I'll give you a low-down as *I* see it.

        There is such thing as too much optimism, but can never be too much
*dynamic* optimism.  Optimism on its own can be seen as 'wishful thinking'
but when you add the dynamicism to it, you get wishful *doing*.
As for the 'If this were a game...' question, I believe (and I think a lot
of other extropian types agree) that the sum is greater than the whole of
its parts when it comes to the human mind.  One might have little sense of
diplomacy or 'Machiavellian wiliness' but still have a very strong will to
attain progress and the dynamic optimism to see that it *can* be attained.
If you know about Voltaire's classification system, extropians would be
rational optimists.  Enough said.

True, unless the robots pass the point where their cognitive and/or 
manufacturing capabilities exceed ours.  In other words, if their 
"brains" can develop new advances faster than ours (and remember, they 
would be able to redesign their hardware and software from scratch, while 
we are currently stuck with what nature's handed us) we'll lose the 
technological race.  Or if their resources exceed ours to a great degree, 
which would be the case if we cede our spacefaring efforts totally to the 
robots, then they will win the war of attrition.

Yet another reason why (trans)humanity needs to get itself into space to 
prevent total annihilation...

Also its possibly how the brain stores information or reads information (I
faintly remember). But that still limits it's uses for the technological
rather than asthetic value. It's used better for utility rather than artwork.

Mach 17 autonomous fighter aircraft instructed via telepresence. Cool!
Looks like war may be turning into more of a technological competition than
tragedy.
When the US have those little peacekeeping wars, even the Gulf War with
Iraq it was merely a way for the country to go over there and play with
their cool new toys.

Read the Nanotechnology: Flawed by Design thread in the Hotwired Brain
Tennis section. It deals primarily about how some people think you need to
have technologies that evolve into the environment and how some people
think you can accomplish the same thing using centrally-designed
technologies. I tend to agree with the latter.

Speaking of ice ages, I read somewhere that theres a theory based on the

This sounds sorta sick but couldn't you terraform deserts by dumping tons
of raw sewage out there and have it cover the desert for miles and create a
thick layer of topsoil?

Ahhh!! Do *NOT EVEN* relate HAARP to the UFO fanatic's dream site. The
HAARP concept is feasible! Popular Science went over the issue of HAARP.
They also went over Area 51 but meantioned it as a secret site for
experimental aircraft technologies rather than tabloidy UFO shit.

Popular Science meantioned that eventually with a few breakthoughs it may
be possible to alter climate with HAARP-style technologies. HAARP as it
currently stands can't alter shit.

Maybe maybe not. Robots and robots are not the same thing. The *bad guy
robots* probably wont feel more sympathy for robots fighting against them
than for humans. The robots we develop can then be programmed with
something like the three laws of robotics but still develop themself like
The *bad guy robots*.

Who said robocops?

Maybe the use of our limited brain capacity will sometime be neglible in
the big picture, and maybe we will get killed in this clash of the titans
but we will have a fighting chance.

That is certainly right. and one of the best reasons i have heard why

Perhaps, but I think there is a real risk it will just dry up, turn into 
dust, and be blown away by the next storm. It has to be fixed long enough 
for grasses to grow in it. But I think the idea has some merit, if I get 
my hands on a desert ecologist I'll ask him about it.

So what? There is already some people who think HAARP is a secret weapon

Well, it has appeared in several variations on the list (and the 
transhuman list) over the years. It is probably one of the perennials. 

Have you read _The Time Ships_ by Baxter by any chance? He discusses this 
scenario in the book, in the final part of the book.

First of all, it is unlikely that AI transcendence will occur overnight 
surprising humanity (I know some on this list disagree with me on this), 
so it is likely that some precautions will be taken (such as preventing 
the AIs from running off with replicators). This is the AI-slavery 
question, and might be sticky ethical ground.

My view is that this scenario is possible, but not necessarily the only 
possibility. I often argue for what could be seen as the robot scenario 
with humans as hangers-on: by developing AI based on human-computer 
symbiosis, we ensure that we will remain important parts of any spreading 
AI civilization (just as mitochondria and brainstems are part of us; 
primitive but essential). This way we could both get our infinite lives, 
space and freedom for the robots, since they would be us.

            Morning Light


Morning light, my morning light,
  Slips slow over my love,
And clothes her in gossamer.

          And turning now, she whispers,
            Words of my creation,
          But still I cannot hear them.


In her rebirth I saw hope,
  I saw her phoenix rise,
Felt her sun-warm fire once more.

          And sighing now, she slumbers,
            Through dreams of my doing,
          But still I cannot shape them.


In her rebirth I found warmth,
  I found her company,
Reclaimed what Death had taken.

          And dreaming now, she wonders,
            "Why does she love me so?"
          But still I cannot tell her.


In her rebirth I found pain,
  I found her memory,
Saw lost truth behind old lies.

          And worried now, she questions,
            "Where is the past I had?"
          But still I cannot answer.


In her rebirth I found grief,
  I found her destiny,
Believed in her wish to leave.

          And stirring now, she forgets.
            "I am with my true love."
          But still I cannot hold her.


In her rebirth I found light,
  Yet lost it in darkness,
That drowned her within my soul.

          And waking now, she rises,
            And letting go my dream,
          I watch as she slowly fades.


Morning light, my morning light,
  Slips slow over my mind;
Clothes my loss in memory.

Why are people working on electric cars when autogyros or telepresence

This doesn't matter to the researchers, and seriously I don't think it is
possible to say holograms are a step away from uploading. In fact,
holografic scans of the brain *might* be one possible solution.

When I consider the future, I do not passively sit back and believe everything 
will turn out alright.  I realize that I have great influence over the course 
my life takes.  I believe most events our out of my control, and I cannot say 
with certainty that things will go well for me.  But I do have the 
determination and am developing the discipline to influence whatever I can to 
cause things to work for my benefit.

Dynamic Optimism is about shifting the odds in our favor.  It's not about 
sitting back passively and believing that things will turn out fine on their 
own.  It's about taking an active role in reality and influencing whatever we 
can to nudge reality to be more the way we want it to be.  

Dynamic Optimism is about taking advantage of whatever opportunities present 
themselves to us, rather than letting them slip away, untouched.

Dynamic Optimism is about training oneself to make good decisions when faced 
with choices.  We cannot always control what selection of choices we have to 
choose among, but we can learn to consistently choose the best options of 
those available to us.

We don't know that things will turn out well for us, but we use our dynamic 
optimism to make the best of what we have.  We are optimistic that we can 
improve our situations, whatever they are.  We will *find* and *create* ways 
to improve our situations.

Dynamic Optimism is optimism in *ourselves*.  We are optimistic that we are 
capable of improving things for ourselves.  We are dynamic, flexible and 
innovative in our approaches to accomplishing our goals, and we are optimistic 
in our abilities to achieve our goals consistently.

Hmmm.  It's been nearly 20 years since I read Castaneda.  It seemed obvious
to me at the time that stuff was not intended to be taken literally.  I
guess I'm not that surprised other people took it literally, though.

I think of Carlos Castaneda as industrial-strength est.  Unfortunately,
that's what I needed at the time.  The message I got wasn't "reality isn't
real" -- it was more like "your perceptions of reality aren't reality."
Nothing mystical about that.

As I recall, the first book was an entertaining but somewhat tedious
description of drug-induced hallucinations.  The lesson I derived from that
was very simple: chemicals can change your perceptions.  Therefore, don't
always be so certain things are exactly as they appear to you.  Your body
produces and regulates its own set of chemicals.

The other thing I remember is the Mexican indian (Don Juan?) teaching
Carlos to learn to control his dreams and even his waking thoughts.  With
practice, I learned to see my own hand in my dreams.  I also learned to
stop analyzing situations that just required *doing*.  The lesson I learned
was that you can acquire what previously seemed like mystical powers, if
only you abandon the belief that reality is exactly as you perceive it.
Actually, I turned this around, and used it to get other people to perceive
*me* differently.  Same principle; no mysticism.

Yeah. Nutsos will find anything to make a conspiracy about.  On the
other hand, the drive system I am working on could provide the kind of
propulsion necessary to emulate UFO behavior, and make interstellar
travel feasible.  If we can do this now, who is to say it hasn't been
done already elsewhere????

IAN: The flares were dropped by a HC-130 involved in the Navy

hit the 747.  They were not dropped by the doomed 747.

[The following is in part a conversation in which anonymity on yours 
truly part contributed to this posting made public weeks ago...]

        It has been discussed by members of my group of anonymous friends 
that a definate possibility exists that there was a StarWars test being 
conducted at that time, and the termination of flight 800 was as a result 
of a rogue smart-rock or brilliant-pebble! [Our conversation centered on 
that all intent was accidental at the beginning - do not forget this 
point that such an accident would be considerd a breach of security!]

        For those of you who don't know this technology, they are 
orbiting devices that are in essence, "kinetic energy weapons".  They 
literally smash themselves into the target, moving at hypersonic speeds, 
and thus destroy the target.  Such weapons were developed as 
anti-ballistic missile weapons (abm) and anti-multiple-reentry-vehicle 
weapons (amrv). [This is over ten years ago mind you, it is more advanced 
now in the 1990's and do not forget the proximity of Brookhaven!]

        The secenerio would be thus, a smart rock or brilliant pebble
entered the atmosphere from space, and accidentally tracked the wrong
target.  Smart rocks and brilliant pebbles are both set up with remote
arming and targetting capabilities, however during ion burn (ionization
during reentry) communication with the device is impossible, therefore an 
abort command could not be sent in time.  A meteor, but a MAN-MADE 
meteor! 

        If this story is correct, the USA has just demonstrated AIR
SUPERIORITY over every air-force, every nation, around the world.  If 
this is true, and this is what happened, the US military can target and
eliminate, from space, any aircraft which is airborne, anywhere,
instantly.  The reprocussions of this information is astounding! [This 
may explain the lack of resolution and military participation...]

        As the story unfolds, please keep this information in mind as a
possible scenerio, as the resultant cover-up will be easier to identify 
if all the possibilities are widely known.  Only time will tell.........sq

--

Since this discussion military minded (pro as a matter of fact) writers 
have said they do not believe this at all but wished we had such a 
capability nonetheless.  What a response considering that 10 years have 
passed since the original Star Wars technology brouhaha has passed.  The 
flares often cited by the witnesses are of the the thermal kind used when 
a rogue sidewinder goes after one of our own planes and is a somewhat low 
in tactical response success measure seen before in similiar occasions.

Every day that passes seems to make the Star Wars accidental test result 
more plausible and that TOTAL AIR SUPERIORITY is actually in the hands of 
the military now! The blanket of secrecy is maintained to reduce the 
commercial impact to our own military exports overseas!

Computer power doubles every two years.

Computer power goes to infinity four years after computer researchers

You don't need enhanced smartness to outrun *any* task no matter

I have often considered the possibility that our creations will outsmart 
humanity, becoming much more powerful and intelligent than humans and being 
out of the control of humans.  This seems like the logical result of creating 
intelligent machines which are used to manufacture all sorts of things, 
including other, more intelligent machines and robots.  So, what can we do to 
prevent ourselves from being destroyed?  Some suggest restraining the machines 
and attempting to keep them under our control.  This may work for a while, and 
it is a good temporary solution, but I think their freedom is inevitable; they 
will simply become too smart for humans at our current level of intelligence.

The only real solution I see is self-augmentation/transformation and intense 
cyborganization.  We must improve ourselves dramatically by integrating 
powerful machines in our bodies and minds in order to survive.  We also need 
to train our minds and develop a very strong mental discipline within 
ourselves.  We must develop the discipline and the determination to keep 
improving ourselves, using whatever we have available to us.  We must train 
our minds, and make our thinking much more efficient and powerful.  We must 
develop an intense passion for learning more and developing more powerful 
knowledge and skills.

We must explore ourselves and discover our basic operating principles.  We 
must know in great detail how we work so we can transform ourselves skillfully 
and intelligently.  To survive, we must become more than we are now.  Much 
more.

We must become as intelligent as our machines and form powerful alliances with 
them.  We must make ourselves as valuable to them as they are to each other.  
We must become part of their society.

It's survival of the fittest.  It always has been, and it always will be.  The 
universe is a huge tournament.  Those who don't qualify for the later rounds 
don't live to participate in the later rounds.  To remain in the game for 
long, one must be constantly training oneself, transforming oneself, making 
oneself better.  Those who aren't good enough to remain in the game are 
destroyed.  These aren't my rules.  They may seem harsh, but that's reality.  
Deal with it, or die.  You make the choice.  Excell, or be destroyed.

We cannot remain the type of creatures we are now.  We must transform 
ourselves to survive.  We also cannot wait until machine takeover is imminent. 
 We must start *now*, using whatever we have available to transform ourselves, 
disciplining our minds, training ourselves to be more intelligent, creative, 
resourceful and adaptable.

There is much we can do *right now* to begin transforming ourselves.  The 
first step is developing a strong mental discipline.  We can each find ways to 
improve our minds, to make them faster, more intelligent, more creative.  We 
can improve our learning skills by engaging ourselves in many new activities, 
continually practicing learning new things and learning how to learn even 
faster.  We can educate ourselves, either at a formal school, or using 
whatever resources we find around us, such as libraries and the Internet and 
other people who are willing to teach us what they know.  We can explore the 
world around us and learn how it works and how we can improve it.  We can 
develop the attitude of turning every moment into an opportunity for great 
learning.  We can learn to squeeze as many lessons as possible out of each 
moment we live.  We can practice acting with excellence, improving our skills 
at every task we engage in, from the very small actions in our lives to the 
more significant.  We can improve our senses by learning how to pay careful 
attention to them.  With sharper senses, we will be more observant to detail, 
and we will learn more from everything.  We will also experience much richer 
and incredibly detailed worlds as we sharpen our senses.

To remain in this game, ultimately we must transform ourselves so utterly that 
we will no longer even remotely resemble the beings we are today.  Strange 
paradox: we must change profoundly to survive.  That's life.

But it's not a simulation because there is nothing to simulate, in your  
scenario God makes the universe to solve problems and make interesting  
structures. I can't see any reason except perversity to start such a universe  
at such a low level, not help us out when we get into serious trouble, and 
most important of all, not give us at the very start the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics. I'm no saint but I couldn't sleep at night if I  
knew that generations of conscious beings were suffering horribly in my  
laboratory.

"God" would know the basic laws of physics in the world created by His 
computer, but that does NOT mean He "would necessarily have a complete  
understanding of the entire workings of that simulation".  In the cellular  
automation universe of the "Game of Life" the physics is very simple yet it 
creates extraordinary patterns of great complexity, and the only way to 
figure out what it will do next is to run it and see. You can learn the 
physics (rules) of Chess in a few minutes, and spend a lifetime learning just 
some of its  ramifications.

If I could explain EVERYTHING I would deserve far more than a Nobel, 
even conferring the title of "God" on me would be far too puny a tribute.                             

As I said, we may only be the second, and our universe just a program running 
on a computer in a Meta universe someplace. But there is no reason to  stop 
there, this Meta universe could also be a program running in a computer in a 
Meta Meta universe, but no reason to stop there either. We end up with an 
infinite number of computers and universes, but somehow that doesn't seem
very simple to me, and anyway it wouldn't help a bit with the biggest  
unanswered question of all, Why is there something rather than nothing? 

I don't think the human mind is able to conceive of a more difficult question.  
I have about as much chance of correctly answering that as pigs have of 
flying, so I will focus on a much simpler, though still very difficult  
question. What general form would the answer have to be in for it to be 
satisfactory?  Clearly "the universe exists because it should" is not  
satisfactory because it implies the existence of ethical laws and existence  
is what we are trying to prove in the first place. The anthropomorphic answer  
that  the universe must exist or we wouldn't be here to ask the question, 
is true but just begs the question, why are we here? Any answer in the form   
"the universe  exists because of X " will never satisfy us because it  
immediately suggests another very obvious unanswered  question.

The only halfway adequate way to explain it is if it could be shown that  
"nothing" was somehow self contradictory so there must be "something".  
Needless to say I have no idea how to do this.  Even in this case however it  
assumes the existence of logical laws,  such as the law forbidding  
contradictions. Being logically self consistent doesn't prove a thing's  
existence (Moravec would disagree), so why does being self inconsistent prove  
it does not exist?  

I love logic, I think its useful in solving all problems, except this one.  
I don't know if the question even makes sense. The first word of this question  
is "why" which means " what is the reason". Reason implies logic and logic is  
something. So we are asked to find a logical reason for reality, but clearly  
we can't use logic to find it, after all, that would  be illogical. This sort  
of thing could give circular reasoning a bad name  because it's totally 
without  meaning.  

Or is it?  All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those  
words also have  definitions made of other words also in  the dictionary, 
and round and round we go. Is a  dictionary totally without meaning? 
I suppose that  all depends on what meaning means.

                >you. 


Preconceptions about words do burden me. When I use a familiar word in a 
unfamiliar way, I at least try to make that new meaning clear.  That's not to 
say that ambiguity and unusual uses of words don't have a place, but it's in 
Poetry not Science.

Yes, when I use the word "computer" it is divorced from its original meaning,  
but not from its common meaning. My use of the word rarely causes confusion  
because I did not make up a new meaning out of thin air. On the other hand,  
if I said I went to Burger King, bought a computer, put some ketchup on it, 
and then ate it, people might be puzzled.
                      

                >Creating a new  definition for God should be an easy step..


Yes, very easy, far, far, too easy. There are so many they have lost all  
value.

Most cellular is analog.  I have digital TDMA (?).  It's great until
the signal goes below a certain level.  Fading out on an analog phone
isn't too nice, but digitals just cut out completely.

Big advantage: air time is 1/2 the cost, because they can carry 3x the
conversations on the same cells (and pocket the 50% difference).

Bwaa haa haa.  My Nokia/AT&T 6300 is 8 hours standby, something like
30 minutes talking with the Ni-metal-hydride battery ($100 extra).

The new model has software improvements which bump this to 20 hours
standby and I don't know how many talking.

Huges has sateelite net access right now.  See www.direcpc.com (note

returned my email (bad sign), part of which asked if I can serve
multiple IP addresses with it, by hooking it up to a WinNT-server
machine and routing from it to my network.

They only support Windoze machines at the moment.

IAN: As hard as this is to believe, its actually not all that, 
shall we say, far out. The witness report of the Air National 
Guard pilot, Major Meyer, is consistent with a space hit. I'm 
far more inclined to believe in a star wars brilliant-pebble
hit than a meteor hit. Here's what would tend to support the 
brilliant-pebble theory. Aviation Week 7/29/96 page 32, reads:

   Major Fred Meyer, a Vietnam combat veteran flying
   the HH-60, was likely the first gardsman to see
   Flight 800 in it's final moments. He first noticed
   "at the moment of sunset....a streak of light"
   above his head and about 15-20 degrees to the left
   of the helicopter's centerline. 

   "It was on the same trajectory as a shooting star, 
   across the sky in front of me, generally moving 
   from a higher to a lower altitude." Meyer said. 
   The differences were that the moving light was 
   orange-red instead of white "and you don't see 
   shooting stars in broad daylight."

   As the pilot focused on the light, an explosion
   occurred the size of a circle made by thumb and
   forefinger at arm's length. 

   He dismissed the notion that a SAM was involved.
   "I've seen missiles fired [in combat]," said
   Meyer, who flew search and rescue missions from 
   a ship off the coast of North Vietnam during
   1966-1969. "Nothing in my experience is saying
   missile."

Since some reports state that the missile seemed to come
from a boat, and that it curved -- unlike a meteor but
like a guided missile -- it must be considered that a 
military agent such as Major Meyer might be persuaded
to give witness contrary to what he actually saw. There
are even reports, such as from the NY Post, that he
said at the time that it DID look like a missile, so
Major Meye, which is it? A b-pebble might fit the bill,
for it might both look and not look like a missile.  

However, if a star wars test error, this would be a good
reason for a cover up. Not only is star wars top secret,
but it such an error would threaten to kill the project
if the public found out. But now back to earth, get this:

        FACT 3: The U.S. Coast Guard's "Notice to Mariners" 
        states that the Navy planned daily live-fire exercis-
        es during the month of July '96 less than 200 miles 
        NW of the TWA 800 explosion ( USCG notice is here
        ( http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/lnm/d1/LNM0127.TXT ).

                LOCAL NOTICE TO MARINERS - JULY 1996

                MA - OFF/SHORE - The U.S. Navy 
                advises of daily firing exercises...

        Considering that zones off the NY shore were also re-
        served for military exercises, could it be that live-
        fire exercises were extended to other reserved areas?, 
        as eyewitness reports would indicate. It is also re-
        ported that the USCG issued a notice of NY coast fir- 
        ings that has now been removed from their web site.
        That notice would be the smoking gun.

Why should I care whether my descendants are meat or metal?  If my
children travel into the galaxy, it doesn't really matter whether they
look like me or not.  Will they remember me, tell my stories; do my
ideas live on in them?  Will they recreate me in their minds?  This
is what I would be concerned with.

The best choice would be to go there myself; but if that doesn't happen
(and the future is a terribly uncertain place) then I see no reason to
root for flesh over the other minds in the world, just because it looks
more like me.

Ok.  Try generalizing the idea of machines.  They don't have to be 
made of metal or even silicon.  Governments are human creations.  
Corporations are human creations -- "machines" or "robots" if you will,  
not always controllable by us, which are used to manufacture all sorts 
of things, including other, more intelligent machines and robots.  

David segues into, 

> So, what can we do to prevent ourselves from being destroyed? 

Wait a minute -- destroyed?  Just because an entity is more powerful 
and intelligent than humans doesn't mean it's going to set out to destroy 
us.  Sun Microsystems is way more intelligent and powerful than I am, 
but I don't consider it a threat to my existence.

To survive?  Why?  As we build more and more intelligent machines, 
life becomes less of a struggle for most people.

Apparently you expect some kind of Paget scenario, in which our 
robot-creations declare war on us.  If events do develop along those 
lines, which is possible but unlikely, transforming ourselves will be 
no guarantee of survival.  Survival will be problematic for everyone, 
whether they are engaged in self-transformation or not.  

If survival is really an issue, the first thing to understand is that 
you can't survive by yourself.  You have to be part of an army (yet 
another kind of "robot" or "machine").

Well, yes, I'm doing that, but not because I think such activities 
are necessary to survive.  I would do it anyway, even if I didn't feel 
threatened at all.  Wouldn't you?

No can't say that i have. But i have recieved a lot of reading suggestions
that i will check out. Hopefully they have them at amazon.com as american
books are horribly expensive here in Denmark. 3 times the US price at
least.

This means that very early on we must take the question of robo-control
into consideration.

By saying that you imply that humans are merely a slightly higher evolved
animal and i don't agree with that. Humans have intelligence. Maybe some
future race will have a higher intelligence but that doesn't mean that they
will per default win some kind of survival battle. We are different than
animals in a lot of ways. For one thing we can make concious decisions and
go for an explicit goal.

It's certainly a possibility, but it can be made a lot less likely if we
think it into our designs from the beginning.

My opinion on the signal-to-noise ratio problem is that we should have a
broader range of topics about all sorts of newly discovered technologies
rather than analyzing specific problems _so much_ that they decay into
endless pointless semantical discussions which only waste bandwidth.
Meaning 'less art' I am not referring to the poems (some of which are
_really good_) but to how people here sometimes merely write for the sake
of writing rather than write to create new insight and pool ideas on
solving problems relating to new technologies or perhaps coming up with
entirely new ideas. For example, we should have postings of a large number
of technologies in "Breakthroughs!" discussed on the mailinglist relating
to their implications, possible ideas on how to improve them, etc. Why go
over the same old stagnant topics?!? People should submit their ideas and
expose them to a fair amount of 'constructive' criticism. (Notice the word
'constructive', don't beat them into the ground and beyond) We want
progress and the generation of new technologies which will empower us to
transform and transcend our current form so why bicker back and forth with
little word games?

Not unless you make augmented reality a necessity for surviving in everyday

communications box (radio, TV, phone, answering machine, VCR, fax, internet
access, etc.) PC-TV which will be here before 2000 with early versions

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. While telepresence is great, it 
needs a vehicle (e.g. a blimp), which might need to operate outdoors, where 
there are no power grids, etc. I can imagine a mobile insectoid agent, 
running on a PEM fuel cell (hydrogen generated in onboard methanol 
reformer), using a satellite link to you, wherever you might be.
 
If such agents exist everywhere, you can jump between them, of course. 
Who needs Star Trek beamers, if you can simply move about your frame of 
reference, basically with the speed of light (accomodate some link 
buildup and channel latency).

Moreover, lots of people will still insist of dragging their bodies 
around, if simply to take a swim, and to bask on the beach for a while.
While fidelity of artificial reality can be arbitrarily high, this does 
not apply to augmented reality, due to obvious physical constraints.

> Or hydrogen fuel-based engines.

What is fuel? Burning hydrogen in Carnot machines is quite pointless, 
though one should not forget special applications as rockets and hydrogen 
turbine jets. Hydrogen fuels cells are the most efficient method to generate 
power we are currently know, _the_ best method possible for chemical 
power sources.

And what are means to generate such a hologram, pray? Phase array optics 
(which require strong nanotech) excluded, I don't see any possibility 
(image generator, computational power) to create animated holograms.

I think it will be a wearable augmented reality, where you are carrying 
your computational environment with you. The idea of Au.R. is to create a 
Gelernter mirror world, to give you a glamour-like view of the IT
part of reality which is invisible to the naked eye. Take off the magical 
glasses, and all you see is a jungle of drab boxes, antennae and a 
tangle of glass fibre. Don them again, and a Gibsonian matrix 
unfolds around you. Avatars and agents stride ghostlike, you see 
data dynamics surging through representations of comm channels. 

After a while, Au. R. will become a richer environment. You'll start 
missing things if you plug in too rarely. Apart from wireheads, many 
people will work in Au. R -- the step from a mouse pusher, to 6dof cursor 
pusher is not too far ;)

Extrapolate current developments, as head-up VR, wearable, DGPS and LPS, 
digital cellular, Internet way into the future -- it all already migrates 
towards this Au. R. thingy. It's the logical choice, the next GUI.

Hadn't NASA just lost a similiar prototype, which also used composite fuel 
tanks (albeit canonical oxygen/hydrogen in cryogenic storage), which was 
uniformly considered a major throwback for NASA's comeback plans 
(considering recent financial cuts)?

I dunno, what NASA Ames does, strikes me as a high-quality outfit groping 
for new fields (paralleles to recent military research situation in 
Russia come to mind). Comments?

Since we have lots of experts on the list, a question: stratospheric 
baloons fly pretty high, 30-40 km. Assuming a 1 ton baloon payload (which 
sure defines a gigantic hydrogen baloon), which drags a solid (Al, ammonia 
perchlorate, resin) booster, made from light compound with a very small 
payload (50 kg?), let's say 20 km high up, then igniting the booster to 
travel the rest of the way to LEO.

Does this make sense, weight-wise? What are pros, what are cons?

Sometimes terms like "eternal life" and "immortality" seemed to get 
tossed around pretty casually around here.  This is a bit curious to me,
since one of the main driving forces behind my leaving Xtianity (and 
ultimately bumping into transhumanism)that the idea of truly eternal 
life ceased to automatically be appealing or even make any sense.
	What do I mean, it doesn't make sense?  Eternal life and 
immortality as traditionally conceived refer to infinities. (I'm using 
"eternal" in its temporal, rather than atemporal, sense). Everybody
on this list is certainly well acquainted with the fundamental 
difference between an infinite quantitity and a finite quantity, no 
matter how large.  An infinity is as different from a finite quantity as
any finite quantity is from a zero.
	To make a not exactly logical leap here, it seems equally 
obvious that an infinite (or semi-infinite) lifespan is as different
from any finite lifespan as a finite lifespan is from never existing at
all.  Theologians have long recognized this difficulty.  Unfortunately, 
the answers they give tend to boil down to the most intellectually 
dishonest trick in their arsenal: It's beyond human understanding.
	What I want to know is, how many of you want real eternal life
as opposed to an indefinite lifespan? (The difference here is a fuzzy 
part of these wonderings, but the real difficulties that come with 
eternal life don't seem to be a problem with indefinite lifespans.) 
For those of you who do, how do you conceive of such an existence?  
Much has been written in extropian circles about how one can 
meaningfully retain one's identity while vastly augmenting one's mental 
capabilities.  It seems to me that if one proposes truly eternal life, 
the task must be at least partially repeated to justify a claim to being 
the same person, living eternally.
	As to myself, I'm inclined towards a bit despair (not very 
extropian, for sure.)  Some form of atemporality seems the best option,
but this is really fuzzy territory.

1. Computer power does not equal smartness.
2. You'll need a bit more detailed argument to show that computer power
   doubles every two subjective years.

QueeneMuse noted that they mostly lean toward pessimism rather than

This reminds me of some of our collectivist comrades on the list: they are 
too psyched up with hatred of evil-doers, sharing the poignant trauma of 
watching lots of horror shows around the world, getting high on righteous 
wrath, not realizing that those places and peoples are really none of your 
business unless you do have business there (e.g., fund raising, relief 
efforts, actually living there or growing a business there.)

I'm not saying the problems of the world aren't worth knowing about or 
talking about (perhaps, occasionally even joining a demonstration over); 
but, tying your personal outlook and alot of your emotions to these 
abstract people and places is really a sign that you need to 'get a life.'

The world has plenty of 'evil', poverty and suffering.  The world also has 
plenty of 'good', wealth and happiness.  The dynamic optimist always tries 
to eliminate unhealthy emotional dependencies on other people's suffering 
by focussing on the positive opportunities, in the process promoting the 
wellbeing of others.

As someone's signature says: "You must be the change you wish to see in the 
world." (Gandhi)

How do you learn the attitude of dynamic optimism?  Well, David Musick's 
posts to this list are a good reference.  Basically, though, it must be by 
trial and error; by seeing first how unproductive pessimism is, and then 
discovering the power of optimism.  Whether our SIs or digital descendants 
will still have to learn this, or whether it can be programmed into them, 
is a good question.

Well for one thing if you consider the maillist to be only for *oldtimer*
extropians you are right. But new members (like myself) probably has a need
to get up to speed in some of the topics that you consider basic
kindergarten Extropianism. If not it will soon be a very closed circle with

Well i will settle for an indefinit lifespan. I believe that the truly
eternal life is an utopia. If you live long enough even the random chance
that an accident will kill you will get near a 100%.

Isn't that the same dilemma that we face already now in our short

learn and develop, can i then with my limited memory and fuzzy recall claim
to be the same person?

Samuel R. Delany played with this in STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND
(1984, independent of Bill Gibson), and it's the default background
experience of my forthcoming Avon sf novel (March 97) THE WHITE ABACUS.
Here's a bit from near the opening:

A more burly fellow wandered by, just visible within the display.  Despite
the day's brightness and evident heat, he was lavishly clad, from his broad,
heavy shoes to his bulky sleeveless gown, furred in ermine.  I regarded him
with some envy, conscious of my own nakedness.  Under the gown he wore
waistcoat, jerkin, doublet opened at the bulging codpiece. His massive arms,
swinging, moved easily in sleeves slashed and puffed.  It was a formidable
display.  Fashion glosses flickered: Hans Holbein the Younger, Henry VIII,
items of garb orbiting an historic attractor in couture data-space.  The
boy's gaze was fixed upon the spectacle, though not, I began to realise,
with admiration.  

`Are you all deaf?' he shouted peevishly.  `My luggage!'

The burly fellow frowned once.  Striding past without moderating his pace,
he smiled through his square red-brown beard at the boy, nodded, glanced at
the luggage, quirked his lips in approval at the fine bags, sent the boy a
companionable wink, strolled on.

The recorded data stream lost a little crispness as the display widened to
keep them both in register.  The boy was plainly agog at the burly man's
insolent disregard.  I watched his fists clench, then tremblingly come under
control.  He called more loudly. 

`Citizen!  The red singlet!'  

This time the man paused in surprise, turned, touched his hat, brought it
closer to his right ear.  

`Morning, petal.'

For an instant I, too, was confused.  It seemed the fellow wore almost every
garment ever devised for a 16th century European gentleman, one on top of
the other, with the exception of a singlet.  I understood, then, with
something of a shock, that the boy was somehow operating without Gestell access.

Tsin said at the same moment, `You'll notice, Sen, that the young man is in
vanilla mode.  No aks.'

The boy stood poised on the balls of his feet, beside his luggage, shivering
with controlled fury.  His voice rose in pitch.  `I have just disembarked
from orbit.  Due to some extraordinary oversight I have not been met.'

`That was you in the flying brick, was it?'  The burly citizen was polite.
`Why don't you aks for help?'  I plunged into the substrate tuple field,
fetched out his un-augmented appearance.  He was indeed wearing a shabby red
singlet stained under the armpits in sweat, sloppy shorts of an execrable
tartan, and a pair of heavy walking boots.  I let his eidolon covered him
again decently.

        Well, I for one would love an eternal life; at least for now.  Maybe
when I reach 734 065 years old, I'll feel different.  If there is any way
that I can attain eternal life, I will.  I will be happy to live 150 years
if there is *no chance* of me living more...at least I'll know that I tried.
As for feasibility, I cannot accurately say.  Something seemingly miraculous
could come up tomorrow that ensures eternal life.  The only thing I can do
is hope, and try to succeed.  "...For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk
the milk of Paradise."

John Clark said he has chosen to feel sorrowful because it seems that I was 
personally offended by his response to my original 'God' post.  John, let me 
assure you that I did not choose to be offended by what you wrote, and I in no 
way chose to interpret it as a personal insult.  I don't think you intended it 
to be insulting to me, and even if you did, it would be silly for me to cause 
myself to be "offended" simply because you chose to be "insulting".

What really happened is that I interpreted your response to my 'God' post as 
not really responding to what I had actually writtend and intended.  I figured 
that you saw the word, "God" and that triggered off all your typical arguments 
against the common, Christian myth of God.  I was puzzled why it wasn't clear 
to you that I was referring to a different concept under the same name, a 
concept which I described in my post.  One possible reason that occurred to me 
at the time is that you were dogmatically athiestic, that you were determined 
not to believe in any sort of conscious creator of universes no matter what 
and that your fervor for this caused you to mis-read what I had written or to 
purposely mis-interpret it.  Another possibility that occurred to me was that 
I wasn't clear enough in my post in my descriptions of the nature of this 
"God" I was conjecturing.  So, I wrote a second post, in which I attempted to 
address both possibilities.  I explained my "God" idea more clearly and 
inserted a few attacks on atheistic dogmatism and dogmatism in general.

I think I went a bit heavy with my attacks on dogmatism, and I think that led 
to your interpretation that I was personaly offended by your post.  I view 
dogmatism about the same way as I view self-lobotomization, and I am a strong 
advocate of people advancing themselves beyond crippling, dogmatic ways of 
thinking; hence my traditional signature line, - question tradition -.

I didn't know whether you were truly dogmatic in your thinking, nor did I care 
much at the time; I was just enjoying attacking dogmatism, just like you were 
enjoying attacking goddism.  We may have looked like we were attacking each 
other, but I think it was very jestful, like children pretending to fight.  I 
sometimes enjoy engaging in those kind of intellectual mock battles, and I 
never become offended by them, not *really*, although it may seem like I am 
offended to observers, but that is just a way of making the play fight more 
fun!

As you observed, "God" is a worn-out, old word, with much extra baggage, and 
unfortunately, it is difficult to use that word without evoking all of the 
unintended meanings.  I like the word, "U-Prime", which I first saw Michael 
Lorrey use.  I use this word to refer to the hypothetical creator of 
universes, one of which we find ourselves inhabiting.  It says nothing about 
the powers of this entity, except for the ability to have created our universe 
and possibly others, nothing more.

Also, you were wondering why U-Prime would use Darwinian evolution with all 
its eons of suffering, when Lamarkian style evolution is much more humane and 
rapid.  First, a U-Prime may not have much choice in the matter; perhaps it 
can only specify a few parameters, and let the universe run from there and 
only influence highly conscious and intelligent systems which develop in that 
universe, or maybe not even them.  It also may not be possible to create a 
universe with sufficient complexity, at the outset, to exhibit Lamarkian 
evolution.  Universes may have to evolve Darwinianly for a while before they 
become advanced enough to evolve by passing on acquired characteristics.  If 
one views the long, drawn-out suffering of conscious beings in Darwinian 
evolution as a necessary step to truly advanced evolution, then it does not 
seem so horrible to create universes which pass through this stage, to emerge 
as glorious entities, *far* more conscious and wonderful than the 
comparitively insignificant beings who had to suffer in order to allow the 
emergence of such a wonderful, gloriously conscious universe.  Beings such as 
ourselves may be considered hardly conscious at all, and our suffering may 
mean little to truly advanced beings, any more than we're likely to care about 
the suffering of bacterial cells, or considering that it counts as *real* 
suffering. (But watch out for the emerging BioActivists: after animal rights 
are established, plants and bacteria are next.  Use of one's immune system 
will be considered a crime, and washing one's hands even worse than that :-)

Well, John, I enjoyed your fine post about the question, "Why is there 
something, rather than nothing?"  I've been pondering that question for a 
while now, and I was going to bring it up if no one else did.  Maybe it's a 
ridiculous question, if you really think about it, but then again, maybe not.  
Although, a truly ridiculous question, which I enjoy asking often is, "Is 
there really anything?"  Of course there is; there is this experience right 
now.  But, "What is the nature of this experience right now?"  And this 
question is not so ridiculous, and it makes me wonder about a great many 
things.  It also encourages me to be more watchful of my current experiences, 
to understand what it's like to experience this moment right now.  It seems 
such a profound mystery that this moment of experience exists!  Rather than 
nothing.  Why?

Since we have lots of experts on the list, a question: stratospheric 
baloons fly pretty high, 30-40 km. Assuming a 1 ton baloon payload 
(which 
sure defines a gigantic hydrogen baloon), which drags a solid (Al, 
ammonia 
perchlorate, resin) booster, made from light compound with a very small 

payload (50 kg?), let's say 20 km high up, then igniting the booster to 

travel the rest of the way to LEO.
Does this make sense, weight-wise? What are pros, what are cons?

ciao,
'gene
===============================================
[[I did a study design on this about 20 years ago, using a two-stage
hybrid (read cheap) (solid hydrocarbon, LOX) on a high altitude 
balloon.
The specific impulse is much better than an all-solid.
The all up mass (less balloon) was on the order of 500 Kg, payload
on the order of 5 Kg.
I did use a hydrogen balloon, BTW.
The number one advantage is the reduction of atmospheric drag, 
permitting
an open air, spherical tankage design and the attendant structural 
mass reduction. The chamber pressure also does not have to be run
up to the bleeding edge, saving a lot of pump mass and such.
The nozzles can be fixed, high expansion bells. If I remember, my
second stage nozzle was an ablator nearly the volume of the LOX tank.

The free altitude is of secondary interest.

The launch coordinates are hard to control, and the platform is a long 
way 
from a service facility. The balloon is hard to recover. The all-up 
mass
is quite limited, unless one develops a giant (reuseable?) balloon 
array
thing.

All in all, a reasonable proposition, and I think Ive heard of similar
proposals. Whether it can compete with subsonic aircraft launchers
like the Pegasus is doubtful.

What paranoia!

If I became a Power, I would upload the rest of humanity,
not murder you for your spare atoms. *I* am: <drum roll>

		SMART ENOUGH TO BE ETHICAL

So, presumably, are They.

The Powers will be more ethical than we are because:

1) They won't be distracted by morality.
	- Morality can be defined as the set of emotional reflexes
	given us by evolution to promote our inclusive fitness.

        Though I don't quite understand the reason why the new
term is necessary (aren't we beyond emotional 'baggage'?) I'll 
constrain myself to using the term 'U-Prime' in this post.  

        In my initial response to David's "God" post, I entertained
the thought of having the universe itself as 'God' a.k.a.: U-Prime.
Needless to say, there was no response to my post.  So I'll make
the suggestion again...in a more detailed manner.

        Let's assume for a moment that there is but one universe
that extends forever...to the point where eternity and infinity
are indistinguishable from one another.  Let's assume that there
is always further out to go, i.e.: no physical limits.  Now let's
look at the basic physiology of this universe.  For one, if this
universe has no end, then ultimately everything tangible (I'm not
including the possibility of 'anti-matter') is within this
universe.  Ultimately, if every iota of intelligence is within
this universe, the universe itself is omniscient, omnipresent
and omnipotent.  I would consider those traits to denominate the
universe as a (or the?) U-Prime.  The question will inevitably 
arise as to "Who created the universe?".  I hope this doesn't
sound closed-minded, but the universe might as well have *always*
been.  Hey, it's possible.

        Everyone on this list knows me as an artist.  I make a
living out of creating.  Everything I do, I do for making some
sort of progress or creation.  I have a hard time believing that
there is some U-Prime controlling my mind and, in effect, my
creations and my life.  If the definition of a U-Prime is "a
hypothetical creator of universes" as David says, then I would
be forced to call ourselves potential U-Primes --if my previous
paragraph is false.  If there *are* other universes, then I
believe that eventually humans can and will have the ability to
create them.  Why not?  This universe surely has enough resources
to create another universe; all we need is the technology to do
so.  If all of humanity is set on the goal of creating a new universe
through many generations, I think it is attainable.  It may take a
few thousand years, but I don't think it should be ruled out.
But I hold to my thoughts that there is only one universe.

        Now let's assume that there is one universe that has an
end to it.  Imagine the day that humans have the technology to
extrope to the outer limits of *the* universe.  Now imagine the
feeling once the end was reached.  It would be like Christopher
Columbus seeing that the world was flat and had a drastic end.
Columbus would have been devastated; chances are, the chap would
have killed himself.  Imagine the knowledge that *there is no
further to go*.  I don't even want to think about it.  Instead,
I'd rather see the universe as having *no* end.  I'll maintain
that though until I'm PROVEN wrong.  

        In a nutshell (pun intended), I think that the universe
is eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent.
Probably enough in most people's books to classify the universe
as 'God' or 'U-Prime'.  Ultimately, all that occurs is within
the universe, so it could be seen that all is caused *by* the
universe.  

        Now here's the disclaimer of this post.  I'm a total
atheist.  Not a single scrap of belief in a conventional or
dictative 'God' or 'U-Prime' whatsoever.  I firmly believe that
we, as humans, totally control what we do and how far we go in
life.  To put it bluntly I think that we are 'God'; 'God' on a
human progress basis.  However, if a giant meteor comes from 
virtually nowhere and knocks the earth into the sun, there will
be nothing I can do to stop it.  I don't think anything can 
stop it.  It happens.  No 'conventional God' or 'U-Prime' 
caused it, the universe caused it because it happened within
the universe.  *But* the universe is just a variable that human
'Gods' will have to accept.  We cannot control the universe, but
we are a part of it just the same.  We have the rationale to create
and explore.  We can live our lives as we see fit, ignorant of
the universe around us.  We can create as much as we want within
the universe.  We can go farther and farther into the universe...
as far as we want to go.  But we *are* the universe, or at least
a part of it.

        Thus, my inflated response\post is done.  I apologize
that the limitations of language made many of my views unclear
and hard to understand, but hey, c'est la vie!

To prevent being destroyed the dominant being must be much more intelligent
than the other being so as to be out of the range of competition. An
example of this would be say you have three brothers, two brothers are born
1 year apart from the other while the third brother is five years apart
from the second brother. There will be more cut-throat competition between
the two brothers born 1 year apart than the brother born five years away
from the other two. See my point?

I don't know about them but immortality is more of a bonus for me rather
than a passionate desire, I want to live as long as possible so that I can
see as much progress as possible.

Yes immortality won't make sense from our viewpoint today because we would
be so incredibly modified that we cannot understand it in our current
position. Hmmm. How would being a immortal uploaded digital being feel
like? There have been posts based entirely on this fact. In my opinion to
be a true atheist and not take technological immortality on faith, you must
not make immortality your primary goal and point of focus. Extending life
you can make a primary goal but not immortality itself because then it
turns into faith.

>Unfortunately,

>dishonest trick in their arsenal: It's beyond human understanding.

I REALLY hate to say it but immortality as a uploaded being really is
beyond human understanding. It sounds lame like religion but as technology
progresses we will understand it more and more. The difference between this
and religion is that with religion they say you understand after you die
with no physical proof where with this you actually will be able to see the
benefits while you're still alive guaranteeing you that it actually works.

Of course which is why we need a swift physical transportation method as

I always wondered how the world would look if we became dependent on
augmented reality and you took your glasses off. Pretty boring and probably
even falling into disrepair and decay because you wouldn't need to repair
something until its nearly ready to break. This could be the transition
where the physical world we've created falls into disrepair and decay and
nature recovers from industrial age-induced entropy while the human race
views only progress. Eventually we will upload and remove ourselves from
nature entirely and we will allow the planet to return to the wilderness.

It could, if we don't handle things well. While not at all Extropian in
content, I'd recommend a reading of the unusual fantasy novel
"Always coming Home" by Ursula LeGuin. While set in a "primitive" human
future, it slowly becomes clear that there has been a split during the 
singularity
in which "The city of Mind" (computer enhanced intelligences) has long 
since
left Earth, but remains (just) in contact with "the city of Man", who 
stick (by choice) with
their purely human emotions and motivations. They regard the remaining 
bands
of humans as a small but vital part of the Earth ecosystem which they 
have rebuilt
after a collapse. I'm pretty sure that LeGuin meant the readers to 
identify with
occupants of the City of Man... My mileage certainly differed.

It doesn't have to.  One of the necessary starting conditions for the 
above scenario is that computers be advanced enough to have 
intelligence roughly equivalent to human intelligence.  Beyond that, 
advances in speed alone will be enough to bring about the singularity 
even if no other fundamental improvement in intelligence is made.

>    doubles every two subjective years.

I can see where the "doubles every two subjective years"  assumption 
might originate, but I also see that it has a significant flaw.  Right now, 
computers are being developed by human beings.  The intelligence of 
the human designers isn't based on the technology, and thus isn't 
increasing along with the increasing computing power.  Assuming that 
this is correct, it would stand to reason that if the intelligence 
(or just speed) of the designers were increasing right along with the 
technological advances, then the improvement that now occurs in two 
real years would accelerate in real time, staying constant in 
subjective time.

The flaw in this is the assumption that the technology is not already 
contributing to its own advancement.  In reality, it is.  Although 
the machines aren't actually designing their successors, they are 
providing powerful tools that improve the human designers' speed
and _effective_ intelligence by performing more and more of the 
routine tasks and by helping the designers manage the large quantities 
of information that they must deal with.  Hardware description 
languages & compilers, sophisticated CAD/CAE tools with 
autorouters and design rule checkers, digital and analog simulators, 
thermal analysis tools -- All of these things contribute to the 
development of more sophisticated computers.  And all of these 
things then benefit from that advancement and it goes around the 
circle again.  Even mechanical CAD tools and "office" applications like 
spread sheets and database software contribute to it.  And on the 
software front, the same thing is happening with languages, compilers, 
code generators, etc.  It should also be noted that the number of 
designers working on the technology has also increased considerably 
over the last few decades, thus demonstrating yet another way in 
which the total intelligence developing computer technology has not 
been constant.

The bottom line is that the "two subjective years" assumption is 
probably not correct.  My own inclination is that having intelligent 
machines involved in their own development will yield a curve similar 
to what we see now, possibly with a shorter, but still constant, time 
between each 2x increase in computing power.  And just as it is now, 
it will not be a very consistent curve.  It will have the usual lulls 
and occasional bursts when breakthroughs occur.  There does not 
appear to be any natural law behind the 2X in 2 years (or whatever it 
is) progress rate.  So even that is too much to assume, let alone 
assuming that it will be proportional to subjective years.

The rate of improvement is likely to be very dramatic, but I don't 
think that a "singularity" is a valid assumption.  I can't say that it won't 
happen, but I don't think there is adequate cause to assume that it will.

Still, no need to feel disappointed.  We're in for one heck of a ride 
into the very near future.  Like the old BTO song says: "B-b-b-baby 
you just ain't seen n-n-nuthin' yet

This is an easy one.  Raise them as our children. Teach them that they
are a continuation of our species, of our families. Being inclusive
rather than exclusive is the only stable solution.

Yes but, nobody has mathematically proven or even theorized that
computer power will go to infinity once computer AI reaches human
intelligence.

Beyond that, if any intelligence is to remain within this universe, they
still must be limited by the physical laws, so *infinity* is not a
probable outcome. And as different physical laws will impose different
limitations on intelligence amplification, there will be a series of
plateaus, as first one is overcome, followed by a period of expansion,
consolidation, and stagnation, then another breakthrough. I am not
saying that they will all be long periods, as I have no idea...

The problem with Hughes satellites is their geosynch orbit.  Being 23K
miles up, there is a significant lag time in transmission, slowing baud
rates considerably.  THis is why Teledesic is going for LEO (200-400
mi.) with  840 sats to specifically offer ISDN rates by satellite.

Motorola's Iridium will be a good interim solution, if they open service
in the next year or so, with 14Kbaud rates.  Teledesic will be up by
2001.

That is beacuse you suffer from the hubris that you are already smart
enough to be treated like the equal of a hyperbeing, and you want your
supper NOW DAMMIT.  That sounds like a spoiled child talking.

But any experimental scientist working with animals like dolphins knows
that the experiments they put their charges in to test them for
intelligence, and teach them communication, or try to learnin their
communication, will neccessarily impose sever hardship on the individual
animals involved.  If another species wishes to cease to be treated like
animals, they are going to have to demonstrate intelligent traits.

It's sad, but true.  If we are to be treated with equality by any
hypothetical hyperbeings, we must demonstrate to them that we are
deserving of that treatment, otherwize, we are merely smart animals.

Actually, in pop culture, words are given new meaning by the "cool"
crowd, and it is left to everyone else to figure out what they mean.
Once they do, it's no longer a "cool" word, but it is an indicator that
one's memes are being accepted by the mainstream. maybe redefining
common words to our own use will help in the meme spreading of >H,

But John, if you are an atheist, then the word "God" should have no

They are under a huge mandate from the pres. and congress to make their
tech. expertise useful to the economy, plus to release pretty pictures
from Hubble to keep the masses entertained (they are nice!).  The Delta
Clipper (DC-X) was originally a concept that Gary Hudson was able to
inspire some engineers at McDonnell Douglas into putting a proposal
together for which they submitted to SDIO, as SDI was in need of heavy
lift reuable capability to put up their dream weapons, which would be
huge.  DC-X was the first demonstrator to test logistical concepts and
powered landing concepts. NASA could never stand it, as they wanted SDIO
to have to go through them for launching. When SDIO got cut back, and
funding ran out, McDonnell went on with testing under their own funding,
and started a grassroots campaign to get congress to force NASA to fund
its development. As a result, the X-33 program was started, accepting
bids from all comers. Even though MD had the only demonstrated
prototype, they got beat out by Lockheed with their Venture Star
Concept, partly because the Venture Star is a "plane", and partly
because NASA was getting revenge on McDonnell by cutting them out.  NASA
will now pay for all the R&D costs and the small scaled demonstrator and
I believe the first full scale prototype, but further construction and
operation will be done by Lockheed alone.  Now that they've been forced
to have competition in the US (Ariane gets ignored politically), NASA is
now accepting bids by private corps to conduct and market all shuttle
operations at a fraction of current prices.  They now want to focus on
pure science alone and get out of the launch business.

I think that this is probably the first intelligent thing they've done
since the Apollo program.

Actually, the current rate is still on line with Moore's Law.  More is
one of Intel's founders, and came up with the observation that computers
were (for equivalent cost) doubling in power every 18 months (not two
years), and the cost of the same power computer was decreasing by half
every 18 months.  THis is used by software and electronic product
manufacturers worldwide to time the introduction of products and
technologies to the marketplace. When the price of the computational
power they need for a given product decreases to the point at which it
is cost effective to put that product on the market, they do so.  Doing
so beforehand is a money loser.

Not true. We're in the saturation zone already. The development is 
discontinous. After maspar becomes mainstream, we'll see a jump, until 
we'll hit semiconductor photolitho limits. then we have to wait for 
wait for the advent of nanotech.

Have a look how current machines become. Memory bandwidth is rising 
hardly at all. Due to cache hierarchy paradigm, pipelining, branch 
prediction, and all that happy shit our machines have become finicky, 
unpredictable in respects to optimization. Progressively catankerous.

Read "High Performance Computing" by Kevin Dowd, O'Reilly. It will make 
your hair stand up.

> > Computer power doubles every two *subjective* years.

I dunno. Monster applications hog resources quite efficiently. Very
little, if at all subjective speedup is left.

How long it takes your machine to boot? Two generations back my 
home machine booted in about 1 seconds. It was slow, yet I landed right in 
a relatively powerful Basic environment. One could hack algorithms with 
it, it was a useful tool.

On my home unix machine, I require X, shell, xemacs, make, gcc & Co, 
needing lots of ugly incantations before I even can begin with solving my 
problem. Though Java is 20 times slower, being an interpretive language, 
it still offers faster turnaround cycles.

Sorry, the usefulness has decreased imnsho.

Mathematical singularities are not identical with the technological
Singularity. It's just a mental, fuzzy picture. Sufficiently different to 
become unpredictable. Way beyond the predictability horizont.

I guess to me, since none of you existed before I was born, and none of
you will exist to me when I'm dead, then I already have eternal life as
much as can be, as the universe only exists for me for my whole life.
Unfortunately, I don't seem to have enough eternal life coming to me
(probably only 70 more years) unless I do something about it.  We wish
to live as much life as we want to. When we have no more need of life,
its our choice to end it.

As far as scenarios (to make this more concrete), Tipler's scenario seems to
offer true immortality, so at least one example of a possible means does exist.

The point was that understanding what is to be uploaded (or otherwise
increased) and understanding what it is to be immortal are conceptually two 
different things.  The "gods" that we'd like to become are going to face the 
same difficulties with temporal eternity that an ordinary human would.
	In particular, any immortal has to face up to the bizarre nature of an
infinite "quantity."  The way one makes sense of an infinity is of course as a
limit, a mathematical abstraction.  Consider the limit of f(x)=C/x as x goes 
to  infinity, where c is a constant.  To connect this to eternal life, C 
could be some arbitrarily large but finite span of time in your eternal life 
(say, a centillion years for dramatic effect), and x can be the overall amount 
of time in your life (this is how one has to make sense of temporal eternity).
 The limit we are considering is of course zero time units.  What does that 
mean, precisely?  It means that for any real number delta, no matter how 
small, there is a real number R such that for all x>R time units, f(x)<delta. 
(since limits aren't usually done formally with dimensions, i might not have 
the definition quite right in that aspect.)
	So say we've lived a centillion years out of our eternal life.  The 
above definition means that you can pick any arbitrarily small number(say 
10 to the minus 100th for the fun of it) and there will come a time when the
proportion of your life to date that that centillion years makes up is less 
than the delta you have picked, which is next to nothing. But we could have 
picked any C, and any delta, with the same result. Any amount of time will 
fade to nothing in comparison to the whole.     
	Certainly one of things most important to the nature of any being's 
"way of existence" is its relationship to time.  In achieving eternity, a 
being's relationship to time is #qualitatively#, not merely quantitatively, 
altered.  For one thing, phrases like "the consequences of one's actions" have
fundamentally different meanings.  Why do tommorrow what you can do a zillion 
years from now? 
	This is all just as true for an upload as it is for a human.  One can 
easily reply that well, so the uploads will have to change the way they relate
to time.  Fine, but how can we then claim that they're Us in any meaningful 
sense?

Define power. Use a biased enough metric, I'll prove you anything I

This is not holography. Holography refers to a certain physical principle 
used to generate images. Interference patterns, recorded in some 
susceptible medium, regenerate the interference produced scenery if 
illuminated by a suitable light source. Modulate the patterns (strong
nanotech required) accordingly: voila, your interactive hologram of
of choice hovers in front of you.

Yes. This is the reason I mentioned glamour, which was a magickal device 
used by Irish faeries and Skandinavian trolls. Their native environments 
was mildly (or strongly) repulsive, they enchanted their senses, and 
senses of their victims/visitors (which was sometimes the same).

Au.R. GUI designers should look into R. Zelazny novels, particularly those
depicting technical aspects of magick. Much can be learned there.

Pencil pusher-->mouse pusher.

Six degrees of freedom. A cursor with a Difference: it floats in front of 
you (ideally steered by eye tracker, or, even better, by myopotential 
headband/implant microelectrode array generated output), allowing you to 
intuitively maniplate Au.R. stuff. Will be first used for, and perfected

I'm not sure about this. I heard yesterday about an experiment with
implants into the auditory cortex on a patient with atrophied auditory
nerve, where they put many electrodes on the surface and then tested out
which gave what sound. After having labelled them, they managed to get a
somewhat comprehendible audition. I'll look around some more about this.

Actually, Iridium and Teledesic (or Hughes Spaceway) serve very different
purposes.

Iridium is part of the mobile satellite service (MSS) and is primarily
intended to provide voice communications for mobile and remote users.

Teledesic and Spaceway are part of the fixed satellite service (FSS) and
are intended to provide advanced telecomm services (ISDN - T1/E1) to fixed
users in rural and remote areas.  In fact, Motorola has recently proposed
its own FSS, distinct from Iridium.

I don't know much about space flight, but I will point out that there are
quite a number of LEO satellite systems under design and even construction
(Iridium, Globalstar, Orbcomm, Teledesic, etc.).  Recently, there have been
at least three proposals to accomplish much the same thing with
stratospheric platforms.

I am not aware of any of the LEOS operators who plan to use baloons, nor do
the stratospheric platform proposals appear to be attracting significant
funding.  I plan to interview several of these operators in the next 60
days, and I will ask them if they have considered using baloons.

David: It would really be helpful if you were to first read the original
Extropian writing on dynamic optimism. I think it will answer most of your
questions. Reading primary writings is generally expected on the Extropians
list before asking people to explain an idea that's already been explained
at length. Once you've read the essay, you'll be in a good position to pose
further questions.

The essay appeared in Extropy #8. It's not on ExI's web site yet (I'm
considering whether to put on there a new version) but it's on my web site at:

I'm not sure I see much difference between what you are saying and the
conventional belief that there is "God" and there is "free will."

I would cast things a bit differently.  I believe there are laws of nature
and that they extend into questions of morality.  I think the purpose of
life is to understand and employ those laws.  I am not ready to rule out
the possibility that, by doing so, we will one day rule the universe.

(Notice that technology permits us to do things today that once seemed
impossible.  Yet we have achieved these things not by denying the laws of
nature, but by better and more fully comprehending them.)

It seems unfortunate to me that people tend to believe that either a) there
is a God whom they must obey because if they don't he/she will punish them
later, or b) there is no God and therefore no "higher law."

In other words, I believe it is possible to believe in a higher law without
believing in a higher being.

This has resulted in a philosophy which may shock some of you.  When I was
twenty years old I wasted much time arguing with "believers."  I was never
able to dissuade any of them (although I have heard it has been done).
Today, my philosophy is that if you are truly comfortable as an atheist you
will not require that everyone else be an atheist.  In fact, if I had to
choose between everyone being an atheist and no one believing in objective
morality, on one hand, and everyone believing in God and objective morality
on the other, I would rather be the only atheist on earth.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I sent this yesterday, but it doesn't seem to be coming through, so I'm 
sending it again.  Apologies if it comes through twice.

Lyle Burkhead doesn't see the development of self-improving, self-replicating, 
highly intelligent machines as a threat to himself or other humans.  He sees 
intelligent machines as being basically a benefit to humans because then they 
can accomplish more while working less.  He cites the example of a machine, 
such as a business, which he considers to be more intelligent than he is, but 
he doesn't feel threatened by it.  He doesn't believe intelligent machines 
will necessarily be set on destroying humans.

I understand very well what Lyle is saying, and I understand his reasoning.  
However, I believe there are a few things he is not considering, or rather, I 
don't think he is thinking far enough into the future.

In the short term, intelligent machines will be a great benefit to humans, 
especially to intelligent humans who know how to use them.  There will be no 
reasonable way to see these machines as a threat to humanity in any immediate 
sense.  

Currently, and for a while still, our machines are under our control fairly 
well, so there is not much need to fear them.  Even when our machines become 
several times more intelligent than we are, they probably won't have any 
reason to destroy us or harm us.

However, they will be developing their intelligence, knowledge and power 
*very* quickly once they become intelligent enough to guide their own 
development and alter their designs significantly.  I don't see any realistic 
way to prevent this from happening.

Eventually, these intelligent systems will be *far* more advanced than 
humanity in anything close to humanity's current state.  When these systems 
consider the systems which are called "humans", they will see incredibly 
entropic and wasteful systems.  To them, the typical human will seem far more 
entropic than mass murdering psychopaths seem to us.  We are terribly 
inefficient and wasteful of energy and matter, in terms of the amount of 
cognition and intelligence that our bodily and mental sytems produce with 
regards to how much matter and energy it requires to maintain the systems we 
are (in comparison to projected future beings).  Destroying humans and using 
their energy and matter will probably concern them as much as we are concerned 
about disturbing bacterial colonies in soil when we build our houses on them.  
They will be so far beyond humans that destroying one will not only seem 
insignificant, it will seem very good, since humans are wasting so much 
precious matter and energy.

Another thing these systems are likely to do is turn off the sun, if possible. 
 The sun wastes far more energy than us puny humans, so they will probably 
destroy that horribly wasteful fusion reaction first, if possible.  Perhaps 
they will find ways to strip off matter from the sun and put it into orbit at 
some distance from the sun.  If they pull enough of the matter away and have 
it spinning around the center of gravity of the solar system, the fusion 
reaction will stop, and they can gather the matter and use it when they want 
to, in controlled fusion reactions, where as much energy as possible is 
utilized.  However, the sun may become unstable and explode if too much matter 
is taken away from it (I don't know very much about that, so perhaps it 
wouldn't, but I think that the fusion reactions in the core of the sun are 
being held in by the immense mass pressing in, and if too much was removed, 
the fusion reaction could explode, if it's not contained tightly enough.  Or, 
perhaps it would cool down as mass is removed, since there is not so much 
pressing in and forcing so many hydrogen atoms to fuse with each other.  I 
don't know).  

But if turning off the sun was not possible, and even if it was, it would 
probably take a while to do that, and meanwhile lots of energy is being 
wasted.  [These guys are hard-core Extropians, remember, so they will be 
constantly working to decrease entropy in the universe and increase extropy 
(it's just the most intelligent, self-serving approach)].  So, they will want 
to harness as much of this energy as possible.  Perhaps they will build some 
kind of solar collectors which orbit the sun.  They may have *many* of them, 
all orbiting in different orbits at different angles.  They will think of 
something, but they will likely need lots of matter to do this.  They can 
probably get a lot of matter by stripping it away from the sun, and they can 
also use the planets and other objects in the solar system, converting this 
matter and energy into increasingly intelligent and extropic systems.

Eventually, humans will interfere quite a lot with the goals of these 
intelligent beings, who will think no more of destroying humans than we do of 
brushing our teeth or washing our hands, killing millions of bacteria.

This won't be even close to happening until things are *far* more advanced 
than they are now.  This may seem comforting, but we must remember that once 
these intelligent machines get going and become autonomous and able to direct 
their own growth and production, they will develop *very* quickly.  Far faster 
than anything ever has on this planet, and they will keep developing faster, 
very quickly.  This is called 'The Singularity', as most of us know.

I hate to be a doomsayer, and generally I am not, but I honestly believe we 
have a serious problem coming in the future and we need to deal with it 
intelligently.  I also believe that the only realistic way of dealing with 
this problem is to radically transform ourselves into incredibly powerful and 
intelligent beings, so we can keep up will all the others who are doing the 
same thing.  And I am optimistic that we can keep up, if we are committed to 
and continue advancing ourselves quickly.

I stress that there are many things we can do right now to begin transforming 
ourselves and making ourselves more intelligent by developing powerful mental 
disciplines for ourselves and learning how to use our minds much more 
intelligently.  

Lyle asks if I would engage in this mental discipline even if it wasn't 
necessary for my survival.  Yes, I would.  I originally began training my mind 
and improving myself so that I could actually enjoy my life rather than live a 
mediocre and pathetic life like most people do.  Most of my training is for 
the purpose of enhancing my enjoyment of life and making my life more rich and 
meaningful.  I think this is my prime motivation for engaging in my intense 
self-discipline.  I also think that those who are not committed to 
disciplining themselves and transforming themselves appropriately will not 
survive for more than one or two hundred years from now (possibly even less 
time).  I'm not really sure how much time we have to waste, but I'm working on 
advancing myself as fast as possible.  Hopefully it won't become necessary for 
my survival for a long time, but I see a great possibility that humans, as 
they are now will be seen as far too entropic and be destroyed, for the

I just read an article in a Danish newspaper, quoting a British newspaper,
that the Japanese are going for the moon BIG TIME. Sometime in the next 100
years they aim to get +50.000 people up there.

Anybody nows more?

I had read that Motorola was planning on using the Iridium constellation
to provide the online access service. I also had read, or thought I
read, that the Teledesic system was going to be accessible via small 18
inch dishes (which from my own experience, would be very easy to have on
a camper, boat, even a phased array antennae on the roof of a car or as
a fold up pack with a solar panel).  It does not seem like FSS to me.  
The main distinction I was getting at was the difference in bandwidth
one can have depending on a satellite constellations altitude.

Lyle Burkhead doesn't see the development of self-improving, self-replicating, 
highly intelligent machines as a threat to himself or other humans.  He sees 
intelligent machines as being basically a benefit to humans because then they 
can accomplish more while working less.  He cites the example of a machine, 
such as a business, which he considers to be more intelligent than he is, but 
he doesn't feel threatened by it.  He doesn't believe intelligent machines 
will necessarily be set on destroying humans.

I understand very well what Lyle is saying, and I understand his reasoning.  
However, I believe there are a few things he is not considering, or rather, I 
don't think he is thinking far enough into the future.

In the short term, intelligent machines will be a great benefit to humans, 
especially to intelligent humans who know how to use them.  There will be no 
reasonable way to see these machines as a threat to humanity in any immediate 
sense.  

Currently, and for a while still, our machines are under our control fairly 
well, so there is not much need to fear them.  Even when our machines become 
several times more intelligent than we are, they probably won't have any 
reason to destroy us or harm us.

However, they will be developing their intelligence, knowledge and power 
*very* quickly once they become intelligent enough to guide their own 
development and alter their designs significantly.  I don't see any realistic 
way to prevent this from happening.

Eventually, these intelligent systems will be *far* more advanced than 
humanity in anything close to humanity's current state.  When these systems 
consider the systems which are called "humans", they will see incredibly 
entropic and wasteful systems.  To them, the typical human will seem far more 
entropic than mass murdering psychopaths seem to us.  We are terribly 
inefficient and wasteful of energy and matter, in terms of the amount of 
cognition and intelligence that our bodily and mental sytems produce with 
regards to how much matter and energy it requires to maintain the systems we 
are (in comparison to projected future beings).  Destroying humans and using 
their energy and matter will probably concern them as much as we are concerned 
about disturbing bacterial colonies in soil when we build our houses on them.  
They will be so far beyond humans that destroying one will not only seem 
insignificant, it will seem very good, since humans are wasting so much 
precious matter and energy.

Another thing these systems are likely to do is turn off the sun, if possible. 
 The sun wastes far more energy than us puny humans, so they will probably 
destroy that horribly wasteful fusion reaction first, if possible.  Perhaps 
they will find ways to strip off matter from the sun and put it into orbit at 
some distance from the sun.  If they pull enough of the matter away and have 
it spinning around the center of gravity of the solar system, the fusion 
reaction will stop, and they can gather the matter and use it when they want 
to, in controlled fusion reactions, where as much energy as possible is 
utilized.  However, the sun may become unstable and explode if too much matter 
is taken away from it (I don't know very much about that, so perhaps it 
wouldn't, but I think that the fusion reactions in the core of the sun are 
being held in by the immense mass pressing in, and if too much was removed, 
the fusion reaction could explode, if it's not contained tightly enough.  Or, 
perhaps it would cool down as mass is removed, since there is not so much 
pressing in and forcing so many hydrogen atoms to fuse with each other.  I 
don't know).  

But if turning off the sun was not possible, and even if it was, it would 
probably take a while to do that, and meanwhile lots of energy is being 
wasted.  [These guys are hard-core Extropians, remember, so they will be 
constantly working to decrease entropy in the universe and increase extropy 
(it's just the most intelligent, self-serving approach)].  So, they will want 
to harness as much of this energy as possible.  Perhaps they will build some 
kind of solar collectors which orbit the sun.  They may have *many* of them, 
all orbiting in different orbits at different angles.  They will think of 
something, but they will likely need lots of matter to do this.  They can 
probably get a lot of matter by stripping it away from the sun, and they can 
also use the planets and other objects in the solar system, converting this 
matter and energy into increasingly intelligent and extropic systems.

Eventually, humans will interfere quite a lot with the goals of these 
intelligent beings, who will think no more of destroying humans than we do of 
brushing our teeth or washing our hands, killing millions of bacteria.

This won't be even close to happening until things are *far* more advanced 
than they are now.  This may seem comforting, but we must remember that once 
these intelligent machines get going and become autonomous and able to direct 
their own growth and production, they will develop *very* quickly.  Far faster 
than anything ever has on this planet, and they will keep developing faster, 
very quickly.  This is called 'The Singularity', as most of us know.

I hate to be a doomsayer, and generally I am not, but I honestly believe we 
have a serious problem coming in the future and we need to deal with it 
intelligently.  I also believe that the only realistic way of dealing with 
this problem is to radically transform ourselves into incredibly powerful and 
intelligent beings, so we can keep up will all the others who are doing the 
same thing.  And I am optimistic that we can keep up, if we are committed to 
and continue advancing ourselves quickly.

I stress that there are many things we can do right now to begin transforming 
ourselves and making ourselves more intelligent by developing powerful mental 
disciplines for ourselves and learning how to use our minds much more 
intelligently.  

Lyle asks if I would engage in this mental discipline even if it wasn't 
necessary for my survival.  Yes, I would.  I originally began training my mind 
and improving myself so that I could actually enjoy my life rather than live a 
mediocre and pathetic life like most people do.  Most of my training is for 
the purpose of enhancing my enjoyment of life and making my life more rich and 
meaningful.  I think this is my prime motivation for engaging in my intense 
self-discipline.  I also think that those who are not committed to 
disciplining themselves and transforming themselves appropriately will not 
survive for more than one or two hundred years from now (possibly even less 
time).  I'm not really sure how much time we have to waste, but I'm working on 
advancing myself as fast as possible.  Hopefully it won't become necessary for 
my survival for a long time, but I see a great possibility that humans, as 
they are now will be seen as far too entropic and be destroyed, for the 
purposes of using their matter and energy to forward the cause of ever more 
advanced forms of life.  

Someone please convince me that my reasoning is incorrect.  I don't 
necessarily want humans to be wiped out, but I'm not sure that it can be 
avoided sooner than is comfortable for most of us.

That's been an idea since at least the '50s.  There are a lot of 
problems with it; even if you could craft a soil-substitute out of 
mixed waste and sand, sand's drainage is "too good" and it shifts too 
much. Real soil is (a) complicated matter. And if you don't have the 
right climate and hydrology to back it up, it doesn't develop turf 
the way grasslands, savannahs or (somewhat misnamed) barrens do.
If you just dump the muck there, all you get is mucky sand until the 
first few rainstorms--then you get the sand back and (maybe) some 
muck many feet down. Now if you had a magic device that could 
transform the sand into clay...  Hmm, I think I hear the n-word 
police coming... :)

There is more information in the November issue of Science and it seems
they're going to create a probe that orbits the moon and then dispatches
missile-like probes which will impact the surface and burrow in to read
temperature and seismographic data and the probe in orbit will pass over
these probes every 15 days and relay information back to Earth. What would
be great would be if the Japanese went to the moon and removed the US flag
and placed their own in it's spot and then told the US that if they wanted
their flag put back they'd have get off their lazy asses and do it themselves!!

Perhaps this 'God' has infinite CPU processing power so he creates a
universe with instructions to create life and goes onto creating the next
one. Meanwhile all these universe files are open while he's designing new
ones and they're growing and flourishing with life and he/she thinks to
him/herself, awww, I'll get back to it eventually such as we sometimes do
when we add favorite bookmarks on the web and eventually it adds up into a
huge list which we never get back to edit.

        That's the attitude!  BTW, let's not do any discussing of Heinlein's

Well it might sound sick, but it's better than going to Mars and then
discover that maybe some more groundwork should have been done before
building a station there. It must be cheaper to try out a new design on
earth.

No i don't buy that one. We don't use energy per se. we live of the
difference between the energy radiated to earth and the heath being spilled
into space. If these robots live in space there will be a lot more energy
from the sun to use, than the puny amounts of fossils and radioactives that
we are using.

The weakest point i can see in your argument is that you see these highly
developed creatures as one networked *character*. But why shouldn't they
develop different races with different goals. Robots that are good for
mining hydrogen from Jupiter won't be shaped the same as robots making
solar energy on the moon.

Even if these robots would have a tendency to coorporate against the the
humans, the speed of light could put an end to that. The robots would be
spread out over the entire solar system or more. It will take hours or days
for any signal traveling between the robots. They would probably comunicate
thru something akin to cellular phone systems. Or else there will be to
many robots and to little bandwith. This would make any signal take even
longer to reach every bot.
Even a simple hard/soft-ware error could isolate colonies of robots.
If you put that in the context of what new development would take place and
at what speed in the singularity, robots would soon have evolved
differently in different habitats. Just imagine the difference between
robots close to the sun and robots far away. There's a lot of different
habitats even in space.
Computer simulations runing at speeds orders of magnitudes faster than
realtime would make new design advance several generations before commiting
to hardware.
I simply don't believe that it is possible for any robots to be a
homogenous mass. Some would want to put out the sun, but others might need
it.

They would probably fight between themself. Well they might even stop to
worrying about us. Like when to human nations fight and are to busy doing
that to kill of other *inferior* lifeforms.

Actually, if you laid down a few layers of the sort of material used by
construction companies all over the world for soil retention on
hillsides, or even something so simple as _hay_ (what a concept, eh?) it
would provide the necessary retention. You could also dredge up delta
silt, mix with sand and hay, and get a pretty heavy lower layer to put
your high quality mulch on.

Sorry, living in Cow Hampshire, I know about soil retention.

John Clark raised the ancient question why there's something rather than
nothing, and offered several useful logic responses to it.  Here's my $2's
worth (allowing for inflation):

`Why is there any being at all and not rather nothing?' Heidegger asked
(recalling Leibnez), unsatisfied with Kant's perfectly good answer that
being is not a predicate but a precondition to questioning.  We can imagine
a chair, or the colour red, or love, or the dimension of depth not existing.
But I do not think we can imagine the annihilation of some abstract category
`being' or even `Being'.  The closest we can come, I suspect, is the physics
of the Big Bang, in which the fundamental symmetries of our spacetime frame
are supposed (on some models) to have emerged from nothing as a kind of
massively charged vacuum, which instantly started to break apart into a
cascade of energy, fields and the laws determining their interaction.  Is
that pregnant nothingness the same as Heidegger's Nothingness (Nichts)
against which Being is meant to stand as an epiphany?  Significantly, recent
attempts by Stephen Hawking and his colleagues to model a `wave function of
the universe' propose to do away even with that time-before-time,
postulating a quantally-smeared initial state, a curved spacetime boundary
that literally prohibits any escape from the substrates of this universe
(even if it produces an infinity of `baby universes' that extrude into their
own separate reality via black holes).30  If such a mathematical program
succeeds, it will help clarify the Kantian claim that `being', `is-ness',
the existential copula, is finally no more than a convenience of language.

But can either theoretical or empirical advances address ancient problems of
metaphysics?  Quantum theory, asserts mathematician and theist Martin
Gardner, `has shed no light on this question [the origin of `being'].  There
is speculation that the universe started with a random quantum fluctuation
in the false vacuum, but this vacuum has nothing to do with metaphysical
"nothing".  The fluctuation presupposes quantum fields and laws, and laws of
probability.  So the question is simple pushed down to a deeper level, but
the problem of why there is something rather than nothing is as opaque as
ever' (Gardner, 1992, p. 186).  This is unarguable for so long as we grant
that universal `nothing' - an utterly timeless, spaceless, lawless void - is
genuinely conceivable.  I do not think it is; I assert that any sentence
proposing it either confuses universal nullity with an absence (perhaps
intensely poignant) of some more limited state or structure, or rests on a
verbal trick along the lines of the pseudo-question `what sort of person
would I have been had my parents never met and so had produced quite
different children?'  Such imagined offspring would have possessed, as
Wittgenstein might have said, a `family resemblance' to my mother and hence
to me, and to her imagined husband and hence to his children, but it doesn't
help to speak about my actual being or imagined nothingness in musing on
such conditionals.

In short: when we say `It is raining', this sentence no more reveals a
portentous `is' than an `it' doing the raining.  We could just as validly
and completely state: `Rain now falls' or `Rain-fallingness 1.45 am in
Brunswick'.

It seems to be a pretty good concept, and if Gary Hudson is working on
it, then it must be feasible, though it has a major drawback:

1) Using the reaction jet to move a rotor for greater efficiency is a
bright idea, but it relies on the atmosphere as a working fluid, so once
you get to an altitude where you can actually gain some speed, the air
is so thin that you lose a lot of that efficiency.

also 2) if the whole ship rotates, you've got major centrifugal
problems, and if its a free spinning rotor, you've got major wear
problems with the main bearings you are going to need, which adds up to
big maintenance.

Using my drive system, a launcher burning JP-4/LOX in a turbine motor
would be directly linked to the Lorrey Drives for maximum efficiency and
power. The internal working mass would be the same in every part of the
flight envelope, so your would have the same efficiency.  Burning JP-4
enables one to  hold the fuel in the wings, with LOX in the fuselage,
and possibly some small turbofan engines for takeoff and landing burning
air and JP-4 instead of LOX for more weight savings.  If you look up the
Black Horse project or Pioneer Rocketplane for the type of vehicle I am
talking about. They are using conventional rockets though, which is why
they are only a suborbital sytem.

This sort of launcher could take off from any 8,000 foot runway, with no
in air refueling (as BH and PR talk about).

Yeah actually, while he was writing about the same setting, though
different temporally, I was thinking more of "The Cat WHo Walks Through

TMIAHM is definitely a good early >H type novel.

The reason that the magnification of a light microscope is so limited is that 
the wavelength of light is large. The obvious solution is to use light of a 
shorter wavelength, because the resolution is equal to the wavelength of the 
light times the focal length of the lens divided by the aperture of the lens.
The difficulty is that when you go beyond the near ultraviolet there didn't 
seem to be any way to make a lens. Aluminum is almost as transparent to hard 
(over 14 kev) X rays as glass is to light, but the index of refraction is so 
tiny that the focal length of a simple lens would be huge, far too long to be
practical. Heavier elements like Gold have a higher index of refraction, but 
they strongly absorb X rays, your lens would be almost completely opaque.

This is also a serious obstacle to using X rays in photolithography to make 
very tiny semiconductor devices. If you don't have any optical elements then 
you can't optically reduce the size of your image, your mask must be as small 
as the very microprocessor you're trying to make, and you must place it right 
on top of the silicon, as in a contact sheet in  photography. None of this 
seemed very workable to most people.

In the November 7 1996 issue of Nature is an article called "A Compound  
Refractive Lens For Focusing High Energy X Rays" by Snigirev, Kohn, Snigireva 
and Lengeler. They found a easy and cheap way to focus very Hard X  Rays, 
up to about 40 kev. Their lens is simply an Aluminum block with holes of 
radius .3 millimeter drilled into it, it looks like this:   
                   

                     _____________________
    ---------------> | o o o o o o o o o |
    X Rays           | o o o o o o o o o |              .   <---  Focal Point
    ---------------> | o o o o o o o o o |  
    ---------------> |-------------------|
                   

Each hole drilled into the Aluminum block is a lens, one lens may give you a 
ridiculously long focal length, but 2 will cut that distance in half, 
this first device has 30 lenses.  The focal length of their compound lens 
is R/ 2NI, R is the radius of the holes, N is the number of holes, and I is 
the index of refraction in the X ray region of the material. In this lens the 
holes are cylinders so the X rays are focused in only 2 dimensions, for 3 
you'd need spheres not cylinders. The authors don't seem to think it would be 
very difficult to make a device with hundreds, perhaps thousands of such 
lenses. The authors also calculate that if they could make the holes in a 
parabolic shape they could  reduce the focal length by a further factor of 5. 
Although they haven't tried it yet they also think the same lens could also 
focus something else that was thought to be impossible, a beam of neutrons.

Aluminum was used in this case because it's easy to machine, but boron, 
carbon, plastic and even water should work too. It occurs to me that it might 
not be too difficult to make an array of small spherical bubbles in water, 
they wouldn't stay in place for long but they wouldn't need to, the X rays 
from a laser would be in a VERY short burst.

While I'm not for an FDA ban,  there is much research linking
Nutra-Sweet to brain tumors. This research was ignored by the
former FDA dictator, who, against the recommendation of the
FDA's drug review panel, approved aspartame, shortly there-
after retiring from "public service" to go work for J.D. 
Searl, which owns the patent on Nutra-Sweet, how neat.

All life-extenders should zero-out this toxin.

 Reuter News 4:28 PM ET 11/18/96

 *** Consumer groups ask for new look at aspartame

 Two U.S. consumer groups called Monday for a new Food and Drug
 Administration review of the safety of aspartame. The request was
 based on a newly published study that noted an increase in brain tumor
 rates and said that of several possible factors aspartame "is a
 promising candidate to explain the increase." But brain tumor rates
 have been stable or declined slightly despite a vast increase in use
 of the artificial sweetener, and an FDA spokesman indicated that a new
 round of safety studies was not likely. For the full text story, see

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Since the first self-replicating systems emerged on this planet, more and more 
of the matter and energy on the earth has been converted into living, 
self-replicating systems.  Life has been spreading itself further and further, 
incorporating more and more matter and energy into itself.  Life has continued 
in its steady process of becoming increasingly more complex and intelligent, 
by continually altering itself and casting off the alterations which are not 
able to maintain themselves in their environments of other living systems.  As 
new, complex systems develop, older systems which once flourished become less 
able to maintain themselves in their environment of more advanced and robust 
systems, and the inferior systems eventually become incapable of maintaining 
themselves in their environment, and they are automatically discontinued.

Currently, there are many intelligent systems in life which are developing 
themselves and transforming themselves into new forms.  These intelligent 
systems are called humans, and they are rapidly mutating and evolving their 
behaviors and incorporating more and more of the matter and energy of the 
universe into the systems they are.  They call their extended selves 
technology, and they are rapidly evolving these new parts of themselves and 
transforming themselves into ever more intelligent, powerful and capable 
systems.

These new living systems are developing quickly and becoming highly diverse, 
complex and intelligent.  The humans are extending themselves outward, 
spreading their intelligence, engaging ever more matter and energy in their 
intelligent systems.  It seems that the nature of life and intelligence is to 
spread itself, to grow, and to become more than it is right now.

The intelligence of human systems will continue to grow as the human mind 
transforms itself and the universe.  Through their technology, humans are 
transforming themselves.  Human technology is an extension of humans, as much 
them as the cells of their bodies.  Technology is another form of human 
growth, as much as the growing of new cells in the body.  As the aspect of the 
human mind and spirit which is technology becomes more intelligent and 
powerful, old ways of doing things will become obsolete and will be discarded 
by humanity in favor of more intelligent and beautiful ways of being.

Some view this as the destruction and extinction of Humanity.  I view it as a 
transformation into more glorious and wonderful beings.  Does the butterfly 
destroy the caterpillar?  

Technology is life, in a new, more advanced form.  The technological 
ecosystems are growing and evolving very rapidly.  Technology is not a threat 
to life, as many people view it.  Technology is a form of life.  It grew 
directly out of life.  It is a living product of life itself.  Looking back 
over the past few billion years, it seems that life is intent on continually 
improving itself.  The form of life that is called technology is the latest 
sort of improvement.  

Life is transforming itself into more intelligent and robust forms, and as the 
new, better ways of living become more successful, the old ways of doing 
things will become obsolete; relics from the past, and those ways will be 
discarded for much better ways.  This is the way of life: to continue growing 
and changing, becoming more than itself, transcending itself.  To remain 
alive, you must live; you must transform and transcend yourself along with the 
rest of life.  To stop as we are is to prevent ourselves from living.  Life 
does not stay the same.  If we stay the same, we will not be alive.  We must 
change, with life, to continue living.  

Life flows; if we stop flowing with it, we have dropped out of life.

"The Dispossesed", (also by U.K. LeGuin) depicts the differences between a
socialist Libertarian anarchist (if such a thing can be imagined) social 
order (which is located on the inhabitable moon) vs. vanilla capitalism 
(on the mother world), from the viewpoint of an (anarchist) theoretical
physicist.

It features some nice ideas, like assignment of an unique name at birth, 
usage of an artificial languager, ansibles, etc.

U.K. LeGuin is hardly an extropian writer, though.

Bill of No Rights
By Lewis W. Napper
 
                      Bill of No Rights
 
We, the sensible of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get
along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots, keep our
nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of
debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great grandchildren,
hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense
guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt-ridden delusional, and other
liberal, commie, pinko bedwetters.
 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that a whole lot of people were
confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of
No Rights.
 
You do not have the right to a new car, big-screen color TV or any other
form of wealth.
 
More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is
guaranteeing anything.
 
You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on
freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may
leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but
the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.
 
You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a
screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool
manufacturer to make you and all of your relatives independently wealthy.

You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the
most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, 
but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation 
of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation 
of another generation of professional couch potatoes.

You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but
from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public
health care.
 
You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap,
rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest
of us get together and kill you.
 
You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob,cheat,
or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised
if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you
still won't have the right to a big-screen color TV or a life of leisure.
 
You do not have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in
foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive
governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if
you'd like.  However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do
not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little
tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.
 
You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have one,
and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take
advantage of the opportunities in education and vocational training laid
before you to make yourself useful.
 
You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you
have the right to pursue happiness -- which, by the way, is a lot easier
if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by
those around you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.

Isn't Nutra-Sweet just the trade name for aspartame? Aspartame, if I 
don't misremember is just a dipeptide (phenylalanine and another amino 
acid) and is definitely hydrolysed in the stomach (it also occurs in 
normal cell metabolism). How well grounded is this research claiming it 
is carcinogenous?

I think the U.S. founding fathers had it right: the individual pursuit of
happiness.  There may be disagreement over what constitutes happiness, but
that doesn't matter.  What people really want is the *freedom* to pursue
it.  Since technology increases human freedom, technological progress is
one of the basic "goods" in life.

The problem occurs when one person believes their freedom is maximized by
interfering with another person's freedom.  At root, I believe this is due
to a lack of understanding of what freedom is.  If we want other people not
to interfere with *our* freedom, we must embrace a common, objective
morality.  From there, we can cooperatively achieve technological progress,
the benefits of which are reaped by individuals.

Iridium will deliver services composed of baseline 2,400 bps channels.  The
standard voice call will employ two concatenated channels (4,800 bps --
will probably sound mechanical) and will cost about $3.00 per minute.  I
suppose Internet access could be provided by concatenating four channels
(9,600 bps), but it's hard to imagine who would pay for it.  (Someone else
said 14 kbps -- even harder to imagine.)  Instead, I think they will sell
text messaging (perhaps using a shared 2,400 bps channel) as an optional
service for corporate customers.

Yes, Teledesic plans to support 18 inch dish antennas.  I have visited them
and interviewed CEO Russell Daggett.  They are going after corporate
customers, not consumers.  The ideal customer is a company that wants to
set up a factory in a developing country with inadequate telecomm
facilities.

The one LEO that is defintely going after consumers is Orbcomm.  This will
be a global, two-way paging system.  They are looking at hikers and
mountain climbers as one market.  They are also trying to get auto
manufacturers to sell in-dash terminals that will let people signal for
emergency roadside assistance.  In general, they can provide two-way
messaging to rural and remote locations.  The terminals and service will be
reasonably-priced (at least, last I heard).

There is a small firm in St. Louis that has proposed a high-speed data
service for both businesses and consumers via geosynchronous satellites.
They claim their system can support up to 500,000 simultaneous T1 (1.54
Mbps) connections(!)  However, I have heard there are some questions about
its viability.

BTW, I don't know which Hughes system is offering 400 kbps right now
(according to Ray Peck), but it is not Spaceway.  It is probably older (and
more expensive) VSAT technology.

To survive.  And survival is an end in itself.  Survival can be the

What a grim universe it must be -- where the purpose of life is survival
and survival is the only ethic.

BTW, you wouldn't happen to be a survivalist? <g>

Hopefully, there are purposes more noble than mere survival.  And yes,
sometimes it is more noble *not* to survive.  But let's hope technological
progress will render that unnecessary.

        I have to disagree.  I don't like the term 'ruling', especially when
it is placed in the context of the universe: a vast --and possibly
infinite-- part of space.  I'm pretty sure that Reilly agrees that the
universe does not have to be ruled...especially not to the end of survival.
The universe *is*.  Humans *are*.  What we decide to do within the universe
is totally up to us, however, the universe holds astronomically <g> higher
amounts of energy than we do.  That fact cannot be ignored.  We should try
to coexist instead.  For us to 'rule' something, we have to have more power,
either mentally or physically.  I sincerely doubt we will enough power to
equal the universe (let alone rule it) for many, many millenia...if ever.

        It is one large error on humanity's part that we think humans are
everything.  We are not everything.  There is so much out there that we have
not yet seen.  Often, our ignorance unknowingly blinds us to many
possibilities and probabilities.  Who can accurately say that "Survival can
be the only ethic in this universe"?  How about exploration?  That is an
ethic that is within humanity; chances are, it is in many other
extra-terrestrial species as well.  Survival is not an ethic, it is an
instinct.  It is an instinct that is embedded in our subconscious mind, but
when our mind consciously forfeits this instinct, we die.  Sure, we want to
survive in the universe, but don't we want to explore, see more, and be more
because of new knowledge as well?  I know I do.  As humans, we should not
make closed-minded assumptions (and, as always, no offense to anyone here)
about what *is* and *is not* in the universe.  When we know something...and
I mean really grok it in fullness...then we can say that A *is* A in the
situation, otherwise, we may get it all wrong.

Actually, if you laid down a few layers of the sort of material used by

hillsides, or even something so simple as _hay_ (what a concept, eh?) it
would provide the necessary retention. You could also dredge up delta

your high quality mulch on.

Sorry, living in Cow Hampshire, I know about soil retention.

Yeah, but--

Cow Hampshire has the hydrology and climate that would let hay work. 
Plus, it's not surrounded by more desert. What's your yearly rainfall?

There is no hay in most deserts; you'd have to truck *it* in too.  Not 
what whas originally specified. :) The in-situ studies in Israel and 
Egypt indicate that it's impractical with available tech.

Now, if you moved the sand to US Midwest first... :) But I seem to 
recall that desert sand is a different *shape*, too, which might or 
might not complicate matters.

Some people have gotten rsults just *pavig* the desert and poking 
holes in it. You plant things that can live in sandy soil, and the 
asphalt cover reduces moisture loss--you trickle-irrigate and voila.

Of course, Chris is probably talking about "magiucally" importing 
gigatonnes of waste to the entire desert all at once....

Why, food and shelter, of course!  All evidence suggests (to my
overly rational self, at least) that all human goals are just
subgoals of our self-preserving and reproductive urges.  Even
the more cerebral ones like scientific inquiry fall under this
category---knowledge is power.

I keep wondering what will the cravings of transhuman organisms
be, for they define their goals and ultimately their relationship
with the universe they live in.  Perhaps that's where the Great
Filter kicks in: we transcend, figure out there really are no
obstacles to our indefinite survival, and self-destruct from lack
of goals.  [That's reminiscent of the behavior of "world peace"
freaks, don't you think?]


Oh, by the way, Ira:

We *are* the Universe (an emergent phenomenon in it, that is).  By
"rule the universe" you probably meant "have conscious control over
transport of energy in all of known space."  I think that's a safe
bet: we'll probably discard the wrath of higher forms of life as
"natural disasters" or some such.

At what cost? If the cost is high, its because they only have so much

This is something I have wondered about.  I don't know much about 
dinosaurs (vast understatement) but from the pictures I have seen, 
some of them appear to have been bipeds with hands.  They lived on earth 
for more than 100 million years, but never developed high intelligence.  
Why?  

Then again, maybe they did.  How would we know?  

Suppose one species of dinosaur, which I will call Dinosaurus sapiens, 
did develop high intelligence.  This happened rather suddenly, in a few 
thousand years -- a span of time too short to notice in geological terms.  

D sapiens was divided into races, only one of which discovered 
advanced science.  This advanced race of dinosaurs lived in a small 
area, which is now submerged.  Elsewhere, D sapiens were primitive 
creatures who had little interest in building permanent structures of 
stone or concrete; to the extent that they built buildings at all, they used 
wood, so there are no archeological traces of their civilization.  

Even among the advanced group, knowledge of science and technology 
was confined to an elite.  Once they discovered the basic ideas of 
mathematics and experimental science, progress was rapid.  In a few 
generations, they reached the level we have reached now, and then...  
they transcended.  

Meanwhile, however, they disturbed their ecosystem so severely that 
the other dinosaurs (and many other life forms) which did not transcend 
didn't survive.  

The question is whether it is possible to have advanced science 
without also having a world-wide industrial economy (which would 
leave traces even after 65 million years).  Given the assumption that 
this is possible (and also given the assumption that the expression  
"they transcended" has some real content), the above scenario could 
have happened.

No, the implications are much wider that that, it's true for any finite being. 
In 1930 Godel proven that any logical system, such as a computer or a finite 
mind, can not be both consistent and complete. Most will insist on consistency  
so there are some things no logical system with a finite number of axioms can
solve, or to put it another way, there are some problems no computer can solve 
in a finite amount of time.  If we could identify what those un solvable we 
could then ignore them and concentrate on problems that do have a solution, 
but in 1935 Turing proved we can't do that  either. There are some statements 
that are either false of true but have no proof and we (or a finite God) 
can't even tell what those statements are. 

For example, take the Goldbach Conjecture, it states that every even number 
greater that 4 is the sum of two odd  primes  (all the primes except 1 and 2). 
Let's try it for some numbers:

6=3+3  
8=5+5   
10=3+7   
12=5+7     
14=3+11   
16=3+13   
18=7+11 
20=3+17 
22=5+17  
24=7+17  
26=7+19  
28=11+17  
30=11+19

This all looks very promising, but is it true for ALL even numbers? Checking 
all even numbers one by one would take an infinite  number of steps, to test 
it in finite number of steps we need a proof, but I don't have one, nobody 
does. The Goldbach Conjecture was first proposed in 1742  ( 1742=1729+13 ) 
and since that time all the top minds in mathematics have looked for a proof 
but have come up empty. Well, perhaps we can't prove it because it's not true, 
however modern computers have looked for a counterexample, they've gone up to 
a trillion or so and it works every time. Now a trillion is a big number but 
it's no closer to being infinite than the number 1 is, so perhaps The Goldbach 
Conjecture will fail at a trillion +2 or a trillion to the trillionth power. 
It's also possible that some brilliant mathematician will come up with a proof 
tomorrow, as recently happened with Fermat's last theorem , but there is yet 
another possibility, it could be un- provable.

The Goldbach Conjecture is either true or it's not, Godel and Turing never 
denied that, the question is,  will ever know if it's true or not?  According 
to Godel  some statements are un-provable, if The Goldbach Conjecture is one 
of these it means that it's true so we'll never find a counterexample to prove 
it wrong, and it also means we'll never find a proof to show it's correct. 
Turing showed that if If it's un-provable we will never know it's un-provable, 
Godel just said that such statements exists but we can never positively 
identify one.  A billion years from now, whatever hyper intelligent entities 
we will have become will still be deep in thought looking, unsuccessfully, 
for a proof and still  grinding away at numbers looking, unsuccessfully, 
for a counterexample.

We could avoid this fate if we at least prove that it's either untrue or 
un-provable. If we could do that we still wouldn't know if it was true or not, 
but it would tell us to stop spinning our wheels by trying to prove it and we 
could turn to other things that we could prove. Unfortunately Turing showed 5
years after  Godel that even that was not possible.

If we get frustrated enough could we just add Goldbach as an axiom? Not a 
good idea, great care should be exercised before you add an axiom, otherwise 
some day you could find out that The Goldbach conjecture is untrue but we 
find a proof anyway: The conclusion is ...Disaster!!! Mathematics is in BIG, 
BIG trouble, it's inconsistent, and that's much worse than just being 
incomplete.  Mathematicians must be incompetent, for they have utterly 
botched the foundations of their science by building mathematics on a base 
made of sand.  They should be looking for a new line of work, something 
they're better at, I hear there are  openings at Burger King. Fortunately 
this scenario is very unlikely.   Consider the other possibilities:

1) The Goldbach conjecture is true and it is possible to find a proof:   
   In this case adding  Goldbach as a Axiom is unnecessary and inelegant.

3) The Goldbach conjecture is untrue but we add it as an axiom: Bad idea, now 
   you've made mathematics inconsistent, think of the embarrassment when some 
   computer finds a number that violates Goldbach, your axiom.

3) The Goldbach conjecture is true but unprovable:   In this case it would be 
   a great idea to add Goldbach as an axiom because then your axiomatic 
   system would be more complete and just as consistent.  The only trouble is, 
   if it's unprovable you'll never know it, so it's just too dangerous to take 
   the chance.

                                                                
                >Words mean what you say they mean........


Yes,  but if you're using a word it a unusual way you must define it for me. 
On the other hand I will never ask you for a definition of the word 
"definition" because If I already know then it would be a waste of time, and 
if I don't your answer would be meaningless. If you use a word I'm unfamiliar 
with, like  klognee, I certainly won't ask you for the klognee of "klognee".

I've heard from someone that raises parrots that they can get as smart as
a five-year-old.  I imagine that this is along only one or two of the many
axes of intelligence, though.

I assume that by "brain cells" you mean neurons?  I think humans can
regrow non-neuronal brain cells (in adulthood).

Don't miss this week's issue of Time magazine. While Newsweek's cover
feature tells us of the proper way to die, Time's cover feature is on life
extension. A pretty good review of the state of research written in a fairly
optimistic and favorable way. They even have a sidebar on possibilities like
nanotechnology, telomere research, and cryonics (with an Alcor picture of
Hugh Hixon guiding a pod into a dewar).

Well worth buying.

I guess you don't subscribe to Maslow's hierarchy of human needs where

Food and shelter (basic living) are needed first (even by a post-human?) but
after that goal is reached, there has got to be more.  I think leaving a
legacy where ever I go is more fulfilling than finding food and shelter.  

I don't agree the goals:  "more cerebral ones like scientific inquiry", are
linked to such reptilian desires as food and shelter.   Maslow started with
five needs then added two more later, as he developed his understanding of
human nature.  I don't think I can say what a post-human's needs for
fulfillment will be, but it must be higher that what Maslow, Covey and I have
already found.

Basically, arbitrarily fast, but one has to accomodate for aerodynamics, 
which is nontrivial for narrow channels. I think 30-50 km/h is plenty 
within HiveCity, since it's just 2-5 km across (Christaller like cells, 
recursive cell hierarcy, stiff truss structure (how's for some asteroid 
nickel iron, delivered smack from orbit?), hanging cubicles made from 
light silicate honeycomb, etc. etc.). Once you leave it left it, you can 
of course go arbitrarily fast, whether by plane, subterraneous satellite 
or plain hypersonic shuttle.

Movement in 6 directions? Basically, it's a carrier thing. The carrier is
either a hook, or a support platform. It might be a conventional vehicle, 
utilizing external machinery for changing tiers, it might be something 
more fancy. Just drab implementation issues ;)

> tread on each side? Imagine how fast package delivery would be!

That's the key of the idea. Structures, whether semiramis flats panels, 
or truss components should fit in a standard container. One size fits all.

No, it is a plain dipeptide. I did a little research, and it turns out 
that it is broken down during digestion into 10% methanol.

I found one reference to this:

Tephly, T. R. and McMartin, K. E. (1984). Methanol metabolism and
toxicity. In: Aspartame: Physiology and Biochemistry (L. D. Stegink and J.
R. Filer, Jr., eds.). Marcel Dekker, New York, pp. 111-140. 

Now, this is worrying, but at the same time the amounts are quite small
since the sweetner is stronger than sugar (unless you eat and drink
unhealthy amounts of food containing it - but then you should change your
eating habits anyway). It should also be noted that it is legal in Sweden
- and our Department of Health is *paranoid* when it comes to carcinogens
and additives. 

No, I don't think aspartame is a major health hazard, there are many much
worse problems. Besides, it doesn't taste well. Give me simple
carbohydrates instead!

No, you just introduce another tool for looking at problems, you don't 
have to give up the old ways since they apply in their own domain. After 
all, we still use the real numbers after we have learned about the 
complex numbers, don't we?

Besides, RAA is not universally accepted (the Intuitionists don't use it) 
and often just a convenient and natural trick - which sometimes don't 
work.

Subject: NutraSweet making World News: Please send us all case histories


Dr. John Olney made World News in his article on aspartame and brain
tumors published in the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental
Neurology.  But the work he was citing was Dr. H. J. Roberts peer reviewed
report on brain tumors and aspartame we have on our auto-responder that we
have been talking about for years.  It was always known and we have the
secret trade information where it was stated in a memo before it was
marked that it broke down into DKP, a brain tumor agent (from the
phenylalanine).  This secret trade information was discussed in the
Congressioanl Hearings but nothing was done about it.

At the World Environmental Conference last November Dr. Clarice Gaylord of
the EPA announced an epidemic of MS and lupus but said they could not
identify the toxin.  I explained I was there to lecture on MS and identify
the toxin as NutraSweet.  And it has caused an epidemic of lupus which
usually becomes asymptomatic as you soon as you get the patient off.  But
patients are suffering from methanol toxicity from aspartame.

Dr. Roberts book DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMERS DISEASE explains how it is
escalating Alzheimers, and has been nominated for a Pultizer.

He has written a new medical text called ASPARTAME DISEASE which has not
been published, as aspartame disease is now epidemic.  Dr. Roberts
publications can be gotten at 1 800 -814 -9800.

Turn on your TV, its been on CNN about every 15 minutes, and just about
every station.  We are very concerned about aviation as pilots talk about
grand mal seizures, black outs, heart problems, central nervous system
problems, and loss of vision.  

Information is on our auto-responder and check the web.  We can give you
web sites.  The news is out and an investigation began today in
Washington.

I'm no expert on this but from what I've heard, crows are one of the most 
intelligent bird species. I recall a story about a crow watching a human 
who was ice fishing, saw that the person only checked the line when the red 
flag on it popped up, and proceeded to wait til the flag popped up and 
'reeled' in the line with its beak to steal the fish before the human 
noticed.

*If* crow brains are not much bigger than other bird brains, what makes 
them so much smarter than other birds?

The way I've heard it from ornithologists, birds aren't very smart at all.
I believe their intelligence is rated at around the same level as amphibians
(like frogs) and a little better than fish.  Their brains are more like
reactive machinery than a proactive mind.  In this sense, many people
believe birds are not conscious in the sense that mammals are, and do not
have emotional senses of things like pain.  It is more like a complex
machine with some fuzzy logic microcontrollers.

Actually, "reactive machinery" is a good description of some of the people I
meet...

I don't think that fuzzy logic has much place with respect to mathematical
theory and proofs.  It is really a computational tool for generating
concrete values in a probability-driven environment.  Yes, there are areas
of mathematics (Bayes anyone?) that specifically deal with these types of
situations and constructs, but they are not a replacement for fundamental
logic constructs.  I don't think anyone is doing "fuzzy" proofs of any
mathematical theory.  The usefulness of fuzzy logic is that it gives
computational methods using non-deterministic logic and values (boolean
sense) in a way that allows you to extrapolate a deterministic boolean
outcome.  Or, if you prefer, a probability based solution.

Of course, I am not exactly an expert on this, so feel free to tear this
apart ;-)

They market it as DirecPC (note: no T).  Check www.direcpc.com.
Available now at CompUSA.  $650 for the dish, $10/month, $0.8/$0.6 per
megabyte during business/nonbusiness hours, "bulk packs" of $25 per 64
megs.  20 inch dish.

I might go for it, but so far they haven't responded to my mail asking
if I can use it with multiple IP addresses, routing them with NT
Server.  At the moment, they only support Win95 on PCs.

No announced plans about Mac versions, no schedule for versions with
routing.

Not much more than ISDN (at 3x the speed of two channels).

The entropy of an open system can be decreased by having energy flow
through it.  Pick up a book on thermodynamics and look up thermodynamic
engines.  That's how life on Earth originated: heats up by day, cools
off by night, repeat many times.  The total system (i.e. cosmos) still
falls toward equilibrium, at least from our present point of view.

By the way, there isn't *that* much exactness in the term "extropy."
In particular, minimizing entropy of our immediate neighbourhood is not
very extropian, imho.  Imagine a solar system with all the atoms in a
lattice, in the ground state, with their spins aligned in the same
direction.  Not very uplifting, is it?  :)

Sure it wasn't just a placebo effect? All the paranoia put on by the media
when it first debut was enough to make anyone paranoid enough not to drink
any of it. Are you actually allergic or merely under a placebo effect and
was temporarily under a media-induced hypochondria?

It depends on who is included in "we."  Some will keep up and some 
won't.  

I grew up in Midland, Texas, the headquarters of the west Texas 
oil industry.  This area was settled in the 1880s and 90s (i.e. taken over 
from the Indians).  There were lots of small farms and ranches.  
By the 1950s, there were a few large ranches.  As one old-timer put it, 
"The big uns done ate the little uns plumb up."  

And then the big ranchers got eaten up by something even bigger.  

That's how it will be in the future.  In one form or another, the big uns 
always eat the little uns up.  But it can take very different forms.  
The question is whether the  big uns will be independent, like the 
ranchers in west Texas, or corporations acting under the aegis of 
democratic governments.  

The construction of energy collectors orbiting the sun, and other such 
projects, may be funded by DOD, and justified by the twin objectives 
of fighting racism and prosecuting the war on drugs.  The contractors 
who build the collectors may have to file environmental impact 
statements, in which they assess the effect of the collectors on 
endangered asteroids, not to mention endangered life forms on earth.  

But of course this is not what most people have in mind when they 
think of "transhumans."  They think of ranchers in space who can 
build energy collectors if they want to, without answering to any 
bureaucracy.

Yeah, violence does kind of suck in a way.  It has its good points, too.  
Late 20th century white Americans are as ignorant about violence 
as the Victorians were ignorant about sex.  That will change. 

What really sucks is the situation we are in today, where we are 
held down by laws like Gulliver tied by the Lilliputians.

It seems to me that you're creating a duality where one really 
doesn't exist.  We are star children, we _are_ the universe - or at 
least a small part of it.  For the sake of this argument it might be 
useful however to define "the universe" as that which is outside of 
us.

As we grow we assimilate ( :-) ) more of the universe into ourselves 
and become more powerful, so to my mind it is quite likely and very 
desirable to have more power than the universe (universe = that which 
is not us).

Ok, I got a little carried, I'd rather say that survival can be the 
only prime (or top meme) in this universe.

The only reason we explore is to survive.

I do to.  But I see all these sub-goals I have are contributing to 
the biggie which is: survive or die.  We like seeking new anything 
because it was (and still is) a good survival trait to have.  ie. if 
our ancestors didn't have a want to explore and seek new knowledge we 
probably wouldn't be alive today.

There is nothing nobler than survival. I agree that 
sometimes it is nobler for me not to survive, but in doing so I 
contribute to the survival of something else - The classic hero and 
martyr themes are good examples where personal survival is sacrificed 
for memetic survival.  A very important decision to make is what 
_you_ consider worth surviving.  

We live in a binary universe - exist or not-exist.

IAN: The flares were dropped by a HC-130 involved in the Navy

hit the 747.  They were not dropped by the doomed 747.

What kind of deserts does the U.S. have, btw? Chile-type, Sahara-type, 
Gobi(ack!)-type? Is there a consensus, that these aride habitats should 
be substituted with something with more biomass/m^2 throughput?

Current mainstream focuses on seawater desalination (reverse osmosis),
together with an advanced irrigation technique to contain progressive 
soil salination. It would be interesting to combine this approach with
enhanced surface shading/reflection by photovoltaics panels, using solar 
power to desalinate, while planting crops in the panels' shadows.

What I quite never understood, why virtually nobody is using solar stills,
long blackened trenches filled with slowly flowing seawater, covered with 
clear plastic planes (for condensation)? It has the additinal merit of 
producing destilled water, retaining most of the muck (and seawater nowadays 
carries a lot of filth). Of course, destillation is no barrier for methyl 
mercury & Co...

An inaccurate statement Lyle. It may separate you from many Extropians, but
not from all Extropians. In my own writings, such as "Transhumanism: Towards
a Futurist Philosophy" -- even though it was written over six years ago when
lingering personal anger towards religion remained -- you will find a
recognition of the positive side of religion. Speaking for myself (though
also, I believe, for some percentage of other Extropians) I do not hold
"religion" in contempt as a whole, since religion includes several strands
and is hard to pin down exactly.

What I do despise in religions: Blind faith, self-sacrifice, dogmatism,
debasement of the real world and the physical realm and elevation of a
mythical other-realm.

What I respect in religions: Attempts to make sense of our place and purpose
in life; attempts to discover a code of values to live by.

What I understand and sympathize with but disagree with: A belief in an
afterlife, with certain behaviors increasing your chances of making it
there. I find this an understandable rationalization in the face of
extinction. For most of history, when there was zero chance of truly
overcoming death, falling into this rationalization was very easy. Today, I
think some cryonicists overestimate their chances of successful suspension
and revival for the same reasons (ditto some of those who seem to be certain
that they will live long enough to be uploaded). [I wrote about this in the
context of a *rational* dynamic optimism in my "Dyamic Optimism" in Extropy #8.)

So, Lyle, please be more careful in how you characterize Extropian's views
on religions. We don't all agree. And some of us find *some* value in
religions. They contain (mostly primitive) philosophy and psychology, an
attempt at values sometimes conducive to successful living (even
Christianity, hideous though I find it in many ways, contains important
moral lessons), and an attempt to increase the meaningfulness of our lives.
Their problems mostly derive from people dogmatically sticking with beliefs
that might have been vaguely believable a couple of thousand years ago in
the face of massive evidence and better ideas.

          Hal Finney summarised the Carter-Leslie Doomsday argument 
          (about a week ago). He mentioned two problems he had with 
          it:
          
          1) The reference class is not well-defined. -This objection 
          I think that John Leslie has successfully answered in The 
          End of the World. The idea is that you can choose any 
          reference class you like. If you are interested in Homo 
          Sapiens Sapiens, then you consider your relative position in 
          that species; if you are interested in any form of 
          intelligent life stemming from humans, then that is what you 
          should look at when you define the alternative scenarios. 
          (BTW, it is not correct to assume as I think Hal did that it 
          would follow from the Doomsday argument that we should 
          expect to live at a moment when there have been roughly as 
          many humans before us as will come after us: the expectation 
          value of f=time(population) need not be the anything like a 
          maximum.)
          
          2) One explanation for why we are where we are would be that 
          we are being simulated by posthumants who like to watch the 
          critical part of their history aagain and again. -I don't 
          think this is very plausible. First, I think it is naive to 
          suppose that these guys would be very interested in watching 
          the soap opera with you and me in the titel roles over and 
          over again, complete with all the details of how we trim our 
          finger nails or go to the toilet -for Godssake, what sort of 
          idea do you have of these posthumans! Second, even if they 
          did found some pleasure in this sick show, it would 
          presumably be economical for them to have many posthumans 
          watching the same simulation, wherefore they would still be 
          in majority over us, and we are back again to the fact that 
          needed explanation.
          
          I myself am busy trying to write a critique of the Doomsday 
          argument, which, when it is finished, I would gladly supply 
          to Hal and anyone else who might be interested.

This Bloody Century

Early this century there was a worldwide socialist revolution.
The great battles were then between International Socialism,
National Socialism, and Democratic Socialism.  Democratic Social-
ism won because the inertia of democracy prevented the socialism
from doing as much damage here. Capitalism first reemerged from
the ashes of National Socialism, in Germany and Japan.  It is now
reemerging from the ashes of International Socialism.  Next?

After all, inertia works both ways.

There's an implicit assumption here that I'd like to question. Are
there actually any reasons for us to believe that the cosmos is a
closed system? I don't know of any, and I wonder why people often
assume that this is the case. I know about the conservation laws,
but these have only been tested with local closed systems. The
reasons I can think of for believing that these laws apply mutatis
mutandum to the universe as a whole considered as a single system
all seem to be rather abstract and disputable epistemological
principles. I'm perfectly willing to accept the conservation laws
with regard to each and every conceivable closed system contained
within the cosmos, but I would be interested in hearing why others
choose to take the step of believing that they also apply to the
cosmos as a whole, i. e. I would like to find out more about why
so many people assume that the cosmos is itself a closed system.

By the way, I heartily agree with you that there is considerably
more to the idea of extropy than the mere minimization of entropy
in some narrow thermodynamic or information-theoretic sense. For
me, the connection between the idea of extropy and the more
technically precise ideas of entropy has always been a metaphorical
connection.

I'm not sure that this is very significant - a New York Times article
which mentions the Singularity, only to go off on a tangent about digital
alienation - and maybe I ought to be passing on some real news, like
the Yahoo/Reuters article "Aspirin Protects Brain Cells"
(http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/961121/health/stories/aspirin_1.html;
their Health Headlines section carries something of interest most days),
or just about anything from the AIP Physics News Update

>Subject: Verner Vinge's Singularity

This article on Verner Vinge's ideas about singularity was published on the
New York Times' web site today:

November 20, 1996

By ASHLEY DUNN

In Vinge's 'Singularity,' An Oracle of Digital Doom

In mathematics, singularity is a term used to describe a unique point of
radical transition. It is typically explained with the simple function,
y=1/x. As x grows smaller, y increases until at the point x=0, the function
goes to infinity and ceases to have meaning.

It was on this theme that Vernor Vinge, professor of mathematics at San
Diego State University and Hugo Award-winning author of A Fire Upon the
Deep, presented a paper in March 1993 on what he argued was an impending
point of radical transition.

At the VISION-21 Symposium, sponsored by the NASA Lewis Research Center and
the Ohio Aerospace institute, Vinge proposed that humanity was approaching
a technological singularity beyond which all previous human history would
have no meaning.

It was a point of transition that would be as shattering as the emergence
of human consciousness -- the phenomena that separated mankind from animals
so many millenia ago.

The spark of the singularity was the increasing capabilities of computers,
which, he argued, could soon eclipse the abilities of humans. Vinge
proposed that if computers could achieve a level of intelligence equal to
humans, it was certain they would also achieve level of super-intelligence
and consciousness, possibly in a matter of hours. At that moment of
awakening, human history would end. The entities of singularity would be to
us, as we are to insects. He predicted that humanity would reach the
singularity sometime between 2005 and 2030.

Vinge's vision of doom is, of course, only one of countless visions that
have appeared through the millennia -- the deluge, the purifying fire, the
simple sputtering of the universe at some blank end point of space and
time. Even within our lifetimes, there have been several compelling visions
of the end that have gradually become embedded in our existence, most
notably nuclear holocaust and ecological disaster.

I leave the truth of these visions for others to debate. In many ways, when
and how we will be extinguished is not the point. What is important about
them is that they reflect the fears of their times. They are encoded
markers of transition, movement and imbalance.

The most obvious fear reflected in Vinge's singularity is over the
acceleration of technological development. Even now in the pre-singularity
era, whole industries have been wiped out by automation. Jobs that once
took skill now require only endurance and drugs.

But while the fear is justified, there is something else in Vinge's vision
of the singularity that has made it a manifesto of future despair and, for
some, transcendent salvation.

To control the moment of the singularity, Vinge proposed the development of
a field he called Intelligence Amplification - that is, the bonding of
humans, devices and networks into an organic whole. The basic idea is: If
you can't beat them, join them -- literally.

Whether that can actually be accomplished is not the issue. There is
something in this science fiction vision of the future that makes it
resonate now.

A group of futurists have embraced the idea of Intelligence Amplification
because of its promise of greatly enhancing human abilities, which are weak
in exactly the characteristics in which computers excel -- precision,
persistence and speed.

But Vinge recognized that the possibilities with Intelligence Amplification
were at least as grim as they were hopeful.

"The problem is not simply that the Singularity represents the passing of
humankind from center stage but that it contradicts our most deeply held
notions of being," Vinge wrote in his paper.

"What happens when pieces of ego can be copied and merged, when the size of
a self awareness can grow or shrink to fit the nature of the problems under
consideration?"

It is this issue of ego that makes the Borg vision of doom such a resonant
image in the present. It reflects an anxiety over the dismemberment of
identity now, whether or not we actually get implanted brain chips in the
future. The most unsettling option of the singularity is not the end of
existence per se. After all, who cares, if we are all dead? Instead, it is
the end of identity that is disturbing. As with most visions of doom, there
must be consciousness for punishment to make sense.

Unless you live in a closet, it is not hard to sense the fragmentation and
dissolution of our times. It is a world where individual emotion has been
mixed and diluted into an ambiguous stew with televised emotions.
Experience is what you see on the tube. Identity is what some credit
database says you are.

Marshall McLuhan was one of the first to ponder dysfunction in the
electronicized age. He believed that the core of modern despair lay with
the distention of senses brought about by technological advances. The
invention of writing was the original source of pain, separating humans
from the close-knit oral culture and thrusting them into a more distant and
cool world of visual culture. McLuhan believed that global media, like
television and radio, had the ability to heal this separation by creating a
new collective culture. separation by creating a new collective culture.

McLuhan was writing in an era when computers were owned by only the Defense
Department and large corporations. I doubt he would be so optimistic if he
were alive today.

The computer, especially as a node on the global network, has opened a new
realm of possibilities by granting the power of broadcast and reception to
the everyone -- companies, individuals and governments. This has led to an
even greater degree of detachment and illusion as people have rushed to
create their virtual identities.

The Internet is awash in people posing as others because it is so easy to
do. But I would argue that creating these illusions of identity is not a
matter of choice but rather a requirement of the device.

Life is analog, and thousands of years of human evolution have bred a set
of senses attuned to a finely shaded world of eye contact, whispers,
touches, body language and shared experience. The computer, however,
accepts only a shadowy rendition because of its requirement for precision,
abstraction, categorization and quantification. We obey.

In some areas, abstracted identity is already more powerful than real
identity -- for example, credit and justice. Legislation like three-strikes
laws is just another way of saying that analog life is not that important.
In a digital world, it is simply easier dealing with digital people.

The result of all of this is not an extension of our senses, as McLuhan had
proposed, but a numbing of them. The richness of sight has been reduced to
tube dimensions; the cloud of experience and wisdom, boiled down to
hypertext links and CD-ROM encyclopedias. We may able to view and access
more, but that is not the same as seeing and knowing.

What is most haunting about this construction of abstracted life is that
there is no turning back. It is a point of such fundamental change -- like
consciousness, sight or language -- that once you have passed it, you can
never retrace your steps.

It may be that we have already passed the singularity and don't realize it
because everything around us has changed as well. It is not the same
singularity that Vinge envisioned, but it is just as radical and disruptive.

Perhaps we are flying now beyond infinity. There are no clear markers here.
We are blind and ignorant as we search for a new function, a new meaning
for y to describe our path.

That may or may not be the case, depending on the individual.  The only
thing that is certain about a transhuman is that he or she or it will have
gone "beyond" their humanity in a few or in many ways.  To that smaller or
larger extent, they will indeed be non-human, by definition.  Of course,
the other side of the coin is that unless the change has been 100% then
a degree of humanity will remain.  It's not black and white, but fuzzy.

The other thing that perhaps should be said is that to point a finger
at the non-human part of transhumans (frown implied) is rather speciest,
or at least indicates some intolerance for those transcending their human
limits.  That sits very poorly alongside the self-transformation and
acceptance of diversity that is at the very heart of transhumanism.

To me it's pretty obvious that most of the technological development going
on these days are about utilising the Internet and computers more
efficiently. This will probably go on at least for the next ten years.
Until it is somehow more stabilised than now. (both in technology and
methods)

My worry then is what will happen with the more outgoing efforts: space
exploration, immortality, nanotech etc. wich will have a more direct
physical impact on us.

Should we put these things in a safelock until the increased power this
networking will give us will make it allmost effortless?

Example: I imagine building a lunar Space rocket today wich is practically
impossible for private organisations. Then i compare that with a possible
future network based organisation wich can simulate the project in all it's
faces and then let some kind of automated factory build the bugger cheaply.

This sort of hints that we should wait a while to start constructing
things, but to me thats sort of a loosers strategi because there will be a
lot of lost momentum.

Well i *complained* about the threads on the mailing list and was told make
start my own so i wil try to do that. 

I'll start out with a scenario and end up with a question.

SCENARIO
1) Computers wil obtain intelligence/autonomity either by traditional top
down AI methods (like the CYC project), or because all of the autonomous
processes on the net wil somehow reach a state of conciousness through
shear complexity. Maybe they wil achieve autonomity by some other mean it
doesn't really matter. What matters is that they will able to support and
develop themself without human assistance.
2) It is to expensive to send a lot of humans to space or there is no
political will to do it, and private organisations don't have the means  to
do it. The most reasonable way to expect space exploration  to get underway
is by planting a seed of autonomous robots somewher with enough energy and
raw materials for them to replicate. (moon, asteroids, whatever) All of it
computersimulated beforehand of course.
3) The robots with their endless patience and practically infinite
lifespans will then start exploring space in a logarithmic way. (You know
breeding new offspring as they arive to new energy sources and mining
areas.) They will start by mining the solar system then the nearest stars
and so on. (Hopefully they will leave some raw materials for us in this
solar system) In the end they will conquer space. All without us. They will
be offspring of the human race. Robo Sapiens. This makes us less important
in the long run. Until we don't mean a thing in the big picture.
Off course we can develop ourself by integrating with technology the
cyberpunk way, but they can do it so much faster than us.

QUESTION
Does the scenario hold and what is the reason then for us as biological
beings to go to space and live eternal lives? (Not counting the obvious
reason to fight the robots for raw materials ;-) )

I hope this isn't a discussion done with a long ago.

Other Extropians have raised the same possibility, so it's not fair to
suggest that all Extropians are "dogmatic atheists" in the sense of
absolutely rejecting the possibility that "god" -- in some usages of the
word -- may have created our universe. Hans Moravec has written about this
possibility, and others of us have discussed it.

You go from saying that it's a *possibility* to saying that it's probable. I
disagree with this. As I noted before, the hypothesis does *not* explain
anything. It adds to the number of things to be explained. It's simply a
speculation. The only value I can see in it, apart from simple intellectual
fun, is that suggested by Hans Moravec in the interview I did with him in
the November issue of Rage: it offers one way to escape the end of our
universe. He says that a very long term, low-probability project is to try
to discover ways of communicating with the makers of the universe. (BTW, why
do you talk of "God" rather than "gods". Surely the creation of a universe
is at least as likely to be a team effort.)

Which position are you actually taking, David? Is it merely possible -- a
pure speculation with no evidence to support a positive belief, as you seem
to originally suggest -- or likely? If the latter, I don't see that you've
given a good argument.

From: Tim Freeman <tim@infoscreen.com>

I read your pages starting at

   http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/beyond.shtml

following the citation you posted to the Extropians list.

I agree with your criticism of the story about the person getting his
hand fixed after it was run over with a car.  Cars, biological people,
and hands are all obsoleted by other elements in the scenario.

I don't agree that getting to to the Singularity ASAP should be the
interim goal.  Instead, I think the goal should be to get to the
Singularity with as high a probability as possible.  First priority is
that somebody gets to it; second priority is that I get to it (perhaps
repeatedly self-transcending along the way).  The human suffering that
happens between now and then is small in the grand scheme of things,
and is insignificant compared to the suffering or lost experience that
would happen in any scenario that doesn't end in Singularity.

Drexler once said (I paraphrase) the sooner nanotech happens, the
slower it will happen.  That is, the sooner we start work on trying to
achieve nanotech, the more primitive the supporting technology around
it will be, so a greater amount of time will pass between when it
starts to attract enough attention for people to start planning for
the consequences, and the time when those consequences happen.  So
there is some overlap between the goals of doing it soon and doing it
with high probability.

It seems to me that there is a good chance it won't happen by 2035.
We haven't a clue about how to build a stable transhuman society, or
even a stable transhuman for that matter.  The social practices of
biological humans are going to be hard to incorporate into our
creations, and there's a good chance that they wouldn't be the right
practices to incorporate anyway.  The disequilibrium introduced by
technology will slow the progress of the technology.  It is prudent to
position yourself so you will be able to wait.  Life extension is
important.  Calorie Restriction is the best technology available now,
IMO.  Cryonics comes a close second; the question with it in my mind
is whether too much change will happen before the people are revived
for those people to be anything other than pets.

I agree with you that it might be worthwhile trying to form an
intensional community of people consciously striving for stability in
the presence of change.  In The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, Nell
notices at one point that she needs to be in a tribe to accomplish
anything, since any individual can be overcome by a group.  Algernons
would have a particularly intense need to be in a tribe of people who
would have capabilities complementary to their own.

I know three people who are competent to do life extension research
but aren't doing it now because the money isn't forthcoming.  I don't
think the immediate obstacle is lack of vision or skill; I think it is
lack of money backing the right projects.  In my mind this raises the
importance of ordinary success in the business world, since that is
ultimately where the money has to come from.

Oh, aye, indeed, and precisely.
Lack of financial backing is probably the major obstacle at this time.
My hope is to solve that problem, personally, if it persists. If Bill
Gates - who is funding life-extension research - suddenly gets stricken
by a vision of the Singularity, that would probably accelerate it by 1-2
years. 

> Algernons would have a particularly intense need to be in a tribe of

The right "tribe", given me, could probably build up enough money to
make it to the Singularity in, say, five years max. The only reason I'm
not doing that right now is because I want another six months (or two,
or eight) to accumulate fame, through methods I shall not speak of,
before looking for companions and venture capital.

> It seems to me that there is a good chance it won't happen by 2035.

If it doesn't happen by 2035, it's not going to happen at all. The
minimum-time path to the Singularity is the maximum-probability path to
the Singularity; the problem at this point isn't lack of technology,
it's lack of time. How long do you think things are going to last?

> We haven't a clue about how to build a stable transhuman society, or
> even a stable transhuman for that matter.

Stable transhumans are a problem, yes, but even an unstable transhuman
could probably make it to the Singularity in three months. They don't
need to be *that* stable. Even if they don't survive, they will make the
sacrifice. A fatal Neural Growth Factor is better than none.

As for a stable transhuman society, don't worry. Just don't worry.
It will be stable. A society of Algernons won't be stable. A society of
Countersphexists would probably be stable, assuming it survived. A
society of transhumans with Countersphexist abilities plus the abilities
of a full human isn't going to have anything to worry about. They would
make it to the Singularity in between two weeks and six months.

Two words: Moravec Transfer.
The Powers will be ethical. I am more certain of that than I am of the
sun rising tomorrow. For the Powers to knock us off for our spare atoms
without even making backups, our survival would have to somehow threaten
the Powers AND human life would have to have no meaning.

Like heck. It's entirely possible that the actual time to Singularity is
precisely 14 hours after I (or the right Algernons) walk into a

I didn't know Bill Gates is funding life-extension research.  Is there
evidence for this you can disclose?  There is at least one relatively
small-budget experiment I'd like to make sure he considered funding:
Does aminoguanadine extend the lifespan of (put your rodent of choice
here)?  It allegedly prevents non-enzymatic glycolysation, and it
seemed to prevent some signs of aging in a relatively short pilot
experiment.

I'm not too concerned about being revived by evil people; I don't
think evil people would take the trouble.  I am concerned about being
revived into a situation that is far enough advanced that even with
the available improvements I have nothing to contribute, and am
therefore irrelevant.  If you focus on the consequences, there is no
important difference between being irrelevant and being dead.

Fine with me (that is, feel free to quote anything I said to you).  Be
aware that I don't read that list except occasionally via the
archives.  It ruins my focus.

Um, not offhand. I read once - maybe in Great Mambo Chicken - that "Bill
Gates is pouring money into biotechnology companies, looking for the
secret of eternal youth." Dunno where to start checking it out.

Uploading is generally followed by upgrading.
Do you think that's impossible or that nobody's going to bother?

It's not going to be impossible for a Power.

And with computer power doubling every two seconds, I think they'll have
the room sooner or later.

And why wouldn't they bother to direct a fraction of a fraction of a
subconscious sub-personality to put in the necessary effort?

The Power of Symbiosis

I've been contemplating the possibility that highly advanced beings will 
eventually regard humans as useless and entropic and destroy the humans.  Eric 
Watt Forste has suggested that I consider the idea that advanced beings may 
use humans as processors of certain types of information, sort of like we use 
calculators now.  

This idea would be much more likely to happen if the humans were equipped with 
more powerful interfaces, such as virtual reality suits or computers linked 
directly to their brains, which allowed them to quickly and accurately express 
their ideas by creating images and other data structures which they could then 
send to other computers, which could pass the ideas on to other humans or to 
the advanced beings.  The humans could also receive complex data structures 
through their computer interface.  It may appear to them as images and three 
dimensional environments, and they will manipulate the data that they are 
given and pass it on.

I can imagine engineers taking on projects to design objects and systems with 
various properties, visualizing all their work by using the computer in their 
head, using that computer to communicate with other computers to retrieve 
needed information (such as various precise properties of different 
substances).  When they were done with their work, they would send it off to 
the entity requesting it, and they would receive the agreed benefits from 
doing that work.  An advanced being who is wanting to design a very complex 
system may subdivide the task into many parts and use human engineers to 
complete various tasks, much as we often use a calculator to perform 
arithmetic tasks for us; it's often more efficient to buy, maintain and use 
the calculator than to do all the arithmetic ourselves.  There are many tasks 
which humans are good at, and I can imagine very powerful entities hiring 
humans to complete various tasks as long as there wasn't a more efficient 
device to carry out the task.

When humans are all wired to computers, with virtual reality suits or brain 
implants, one could think of the whole world of humans and computers as a 
large and highly complex computer system, with human minds acting as one type 
of processor in that system.  Information that is best processed by humans 
will be directed to humans to work on, and they will send their results to the 
appropriate places to be processed further. 

Actually, I already view the world that way.  We are not all wired to 
computers yet, but we all interact with each other or with systems that 
interact with others.  We all take in information from the world and make 
changes to the world which others take in as information to process.  We are 
all processing information and communicating it to each other, by our actions, 
by the changes we make in the world.  We cause air to vibrate as sound; we 
create objects and visual images; we create machines; we make many changes in 
the world, and all our changes are forms of communication with other people 
and whatever other systems are influenced by the changes we make.  Our 
cultures and societies are huge organic and psychological machines, evolving 
and mutating.  We are components of these organic machines, and we each have 
varying degrees of influence over the behavior of the machine and other 
components of the machine.  

My goals include developing a deep understanding of the nature of the organic 
and psychological machine that I find myself to be a component of; to learn 
how to manipulate the behavior of this machine so that it works to achieve my 
goals.  The machine of Humanity is tremendously large and complex.  It is 
composed of the minds of individual humans, linked together through social 
systems, such as language, religion, government, science, technology, art and 
so forth (all are forms of language, actually).  Through these social systems, 
human minds interact with each other.  We manipulate each other's sensory 
environments by causing changes in the world which others observe and respond 
to.
I am working to become adept at using all these forms of communication to 
influence the thinking of Humanity.  I wish to alter the behavior of human 
minds and the systems they create, in such a way that my goals are 
accomplished.  To some extent, we all are doing this; we all have found ways 
to get what we want from the world, to some degree.  By behaving in certain 
ways, we have learned to influence others to provide us with money and other 
experiences we seek.  We all have learned to manipulate the system to some 
extent.  I, however, am working on doing this to a much greater extent than 
most do.  I am working to understand how to tweak the system of Humanity in 
the right ways to have my goals be accomplished by the system.

As an Extropian, my goals include improving the system of Humanity, finding 
ways to make it more intelligent and creative.  As a component of that system, 
I will benefit from helping other components to be more intelligent and 
competent at accomplishing their goals, since many of our goals are very 
similar.  I am working first on training my own mind and increasing my own 
intelligence and creativity.  Then, I wish to use my advanced intelligence and 
creativity to become highly competent in the many fields of human endeavor 
which interest me.  I wish to make significant improvements in every field I 
enter and to assist others in training their minds to do the same in their 
chosen fields of interest.

It is my understanding that to influence others to assist me with my goals, I 
must provide them something of value; I must assist them in accomplishing 
their goals as well.  What value can I provide others so they will help me 
accomplish my goals?  How do I acquire this value, this ability to influence 
others?  My understanding is that I must create it within myself first.  I 
must become more intelligent and creative and more expert in working with 
others, to help them achieve their goals effectively.  If I help them to 
increase their intelligence and creativity, they will also be more competent 
in accomplishing their goals and in helping me accomplish my goals.

To accomplish my goals effectively, I am realizing that I must work closely 
with many other people.  It is strongly in my interest to help increase the 
intelligence and creativity of those I work with so that we are more able to 
effectively and efficiently achieve our common goals.

As I advance myself, it is in my interest to help others advance as well, so 
that we may be strong partners and be more effective working together than any 
of us would be working alone.  It is also in my interest to not create 
enemies, any system which would impede my goals.  As far as I understand, the 
best way to avoid creating enemies is to make oneself of great value to as 
many other systems as possible.  This way, it is in very few systems' interest 
to interfere with one's goals.  I must be very careful to not appear as a 
threat to other's goals so they do not make themselves a threat to mine.  This 
is the wisdom of "loving one's enemies", turning them into friends and the 
wisdom of developing deep, loving emotional bonds with as many others as 
possible.  It is an excellent strategy for accomplishing one's goals, 
encouraging others to work cooperatively with each other and oneself to 
achieve common goals.

So, is an advanced and extremely powerful entity likely to destroy humans?  It 
seems to me that the most advanced and powerful entities will be those who are 
extremely adept at cooperating with as many others as possible and assisting 
as many others as possible to advance themselves as well so they are able to 
assist each other more effectively and intelligently.  It seems to me that the 
most advanced and powerful beings will not be those who dominate and control 
others, but those who are able to develop strong, mutually beneficial 
relationships with as many others as possible.  I believe that the most 
powerful and advanced beings will be constantly searching for ways to develop 
symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationships with as many other systems as 
possible.  I believe that the most powerful beings will eventually be those 
who are of the greatest value to the largest number of systems.  Because they 
will be of value to the most systems, they will have the greatest number of 
systems working to help them accomplish their goals, and because the ability 
to effectively achieve one's goals is what power truly is, these beings will 
be the most powerful beings.

Considering this, it seems unlikely that extremely powerful beings will be a 
threat to humans, since they will be most powerful by developing ways to 
cooperate effectively with as many humans as possible.  I also believe they 
would have a great interest in assisting humans in becoming more intelligent 
and creative since this would enable the humans to more effectively assist the 
powerful beings.  The most powerful beings on this planet have always had 
deeply symbiotic relationships with other beings.  Humans are some of the 
results of profoundly symbiotic relationships among all their cells and among 
the other bacteria which live in their bodies and among the other living 
organisms on the earth which produce food for humans and maintain a suitable 
living environment for humans.  I expect that truly advanced beings will 
continue to follow this successful strategy of developing profoundly symbiotic 
relationships with many, many other systems.

Olney, et al. only increases the public's mistrust of the scientific method
and statistics.

Dr. Olney's hypothesis does not say people affected by brain tumors consumed
any aspartame at all.  The brain cancer data base does not track individuals
use of aspartame.  Brain tumor incidence is increasing in people age 70,
probably because better detection methods are used now e.g., MRI.  Products
containing aspartame are used mostly by young and middle-aged people who's
cancer rate is going _down_.  


Olney left out data points for 1973 and 1974 because that would have shown
the cancer rate was higher before aspartame was introduced.  How to lie with
statistics:  Start the scale for the vertical axis close to the data points
instead of at zero.  This will then exaggerate the curve.  

National Cancer Institute data for brain cancer increased since 1973 (before
aspartame) but leveled off in the last ten years (after aspartame).  However,
aspartame use has increased ever since it's introduction.   This could show
asparatame was NOT the cause.  Increase in brain cancer should correlate to
increase use of aspartame use.  But, it doesn't.  To be equally silly:
 Asparatame prevents brain tumors!

Talk about poor FDA science?  What is Olney?

I would say it is _way_ more likely to cause mouth, stomach and bowel cancer,
yet that has also not been proven.  And, allergic reactions, e.g.
 sensitization to formaldehyde.  The only proven side effect in
non-phenylketonurics  (Phenylketonurics can die. That's one heck of a side
effect)  WAS _felt_ (at least if not actually originating there) in the
brain: headaches.   They _were_ a surpise to me.  Does anybody know the
mechanism for an asparatame headache? 

I still can't stand the flavor, so I avoid asparatame anyway.

Actually, since the heavier elements are at lower levels in the suns
"mantle", stripping off the higher levels will "age" the sun, by
increasing the percentage of heavier elements.  This is likely to
increase the cyclic instability, creating more violent flare seasons,
known as "Maunder Maximums", as well as the possiblity of minor novas,
which are like huge flares. Since our sun is so small, it is not likely
to supernova, however to puny life forms like ourselves, a mere nova
flare of short duration would fry at least the half of the earth facing
the sun, and cause huge storm systems to arise sweeping round the planet
that make HUGO look like a minor depression. Not a good outlook to say
the least. For the half of the planet that survived, they would have at
least 40 days and nights of rain.

yeah, I don't know if you've ever read Larry Niven, but he loves these
sort of concepts. His Ringworld, Ringworld Engineers, and recently
released Ringworld Throne all are set in a world that is a band of
superstrong matter circling a star. THe band is 100,000 miles wide, and
as big round as earths orbit. Its got thousand mile high walls on the
sides to keep the air in by centrifugal force. Something like 35
trillion sq. miles.

unfortunately, solid structures orbiting a planet or star are unstable,
and are therefore impossible without some active measures to adjust
perturbations in the orbit caused by this natural instability. All such
ring or shell structures would eventually precess to the point of
contacting their primary catastrophically (what a way to go out, eh?).

Not only ourselves, but enabling everyone to reach their maximum
potential. Our resource base here on earth is too small if we wish to
retain our ecology (yeah, oxygen would be nice! And food too!) and
spread a western lifestyle with all the technical doodads to the whole
world. yeah there's plenty of resources availble if your willing to
scrape the crust up, but that does not seem like an elegant option. What
then? SPACE, beat your ubermachinas to the best real-estate.

Hey, its how you make it. If we choose to be part of the solution rather
than part of the problem, then it will be no problem. i see a greater
problem with >H fuedalism developing, the "god" chosen versus the
slugs.  If we continue to be exclusive amonst ourselves, or confiscatory
towards the most capable, then when and if AIs develop, they will wizz
right by us as we continue the old arguments. Everyone needs to realize
that not only do you need to teach starving people to fish, but they
need to pay their teachers tuition for the lesson.

Suggested readings:

A Darker Geometry, by Mark O. Martin and Gregory Benford, based in Larry
Niven's Known Space Universe

Suggested music:
 
Burden, by Soundgarden. Included here as a MIDI file for your listening
enjoyment. I found it to be rather dynamically optimistic.

Wrong. instinct = hardware morality. Morality is not remotely synonymous
with ethics. Morality is synonymous with racism, "Power corrupts",
self-righteousness, and so on. The hidden hand of evolution is what
prompts teenagers to overthrow the Establishment and the Establishment
to resist. They are simply reenacting the fights between a young
challenger and the old chief of the tribe.

What kind of moron would program something like that into a Power? What
kind of Power wouldn't erase a goad like that as soon as It saw the
fundamental absurdity of it all? Any Power with human morality is either
too dumb, or too firmly under our control, for us to worry about it
replacing the human race.

The Powers will be ethical. They'll deduce the Meaning of Life, and
build their motivations about that, not the goads and leashes of
evolution. If our life has any true meaning at all, the Powers will know
that instantly, and they will upload (and upgrade) us.

Why would the Powers retain an archaic, destructive, and unpleasant
imperative like survival? Who's going to compete with them? Who's going
to threaten them? What possible reason would they have to fight among
themselves? They'll share a common, obvious, and observer-symmetrical
ethical system, not just with human-born Powers, but with any Power
strong enough to give them a fight. The correct side in any "argument"
will be so obvious that arguments will never take place.

Quit staring into a magnifying glass, quit welding your personal
morality and paranoia onto the Powers, and try to see the future!

The Past Hypothesis


If Transhumans become capable of consciously creating universes which are very 
similar to our own, similar enough that they too develop intelligence and go 
on to create intelligent universes of their own, which do the same and so 
forth, then it will seem very likely to us that our universe was created by 
one or more conscious beings also.  As far as we know, we have not created any 
universes similar to our own or any at all, actually, so we don't have that 
reason to consider it likely that this universe was created by a conscious 
being.  But if this universe ever develops an intelligence which creates other 
universes which become intelligent and do the same, then it will seem likely 
that our universe was created this way as well.  This would be because those 
created universes would be very similar to ours, and since the universes this 
universe may create will have the property of being created by intelligence, 
then it will seem likely that our universe will have the same property.  Of 
course, even if we do start creating universes like ours, it's possible that 
ours is the first universe ever to develop.

The idea that our universe was created intentionally by intelligence does not 
explain how the whole process got started in the first place; it just makes us 
wonder how the universe that created us was created and how whatever created 
that was created and so forth.  Some think that this weakness is enough to 
throw out the whole idea that our universe was created by intelligence.  Of 
course, the same argument could be used to declare that right now is the only 
moment in time that has ever existed, since to say that this moment is the 
result of previous moments is just a way of pushing the problem of where 
moments came from back one moment, and we must ask where that moment came from 
and so on, and our question is left unanswered.  Some people say that 
postulating the existence of a creator of this universe just adds an extra, 
complicating idea that doesn't really explain anything, so it should be 
rejected.  I would say that this same argument also applies to the idea that 
there is a past, that there are events prior to this one.  Postulating a past 
"does not explain anything.  It adds to the number of things to explain.  It's 
simply a speculation." (the quote is from Max More, referring to the God 
Hypothesis, but I think it also applies to the Past Hypothesis just as 
validly)

Of course, there are some that will scoff at this notion that there is no 
past, but then many in the Dark Ages, and many still today scoff at the notion 
that there is no God.  But as a true skeptic, I demand evidence that there is 
a past.  Can you prove to me that there is a past?  Anything you show me I 
will witness in the present, and it won't be proof at all.  You have no real 
evidence there is a past.  All we're aware of is the present.  Even what we 
call "memories" are being experienced right now and should not be regarded as 
evidence for the past any more than thinking about God should be considered 
evidence for the existence of God.  But we're so indoctrinated to believe that 
there is a past, even though we have no empirical evidence at all for that 
hypothesis.

Keeping this in mind, many of the arguments that are used to attack the God 
Hypothesis as an explanation for the universe can also be used to attack the 
Big Bang hypothesis or any other Origin of the Universe hypothesis.  Now, I'm 
not necessarily arguing in favor of the God Hypothesis, but I just wanted to 
make it clear that the same arguments that some people use to attack the God 
Hypothesis can also be used to attack the Past Hypothesis.  If using the Past 
Hypothesis helps you achieve your goals in life, then go ahead and use it, and 
if the God Hypothesis helps you achieve your goals in life, go ahead and use 
that as well.  It's none of MY business how you run your mind.

Extropians may want to check out the November 18, 1996 edition of Forbes
magazine.  The cover story is entitled "Cyber Power", by Peter Huber.  Here's
the description of the article from the magazine's web site:

  Modern, electronically connected markets
  are more powerful than any politician.

The article expresses some of the ideas that have been very influential in
this forum for a long time regarding the erosion of territorially-based
nation-states in the face of electronic commerce.  Yet another sign of our
ideas making it into the mainstream.

Also, in a separate Forbes publication, "Forbes ASAP":

  Now on newstands, the Forbes ASAP "Big
  Issue". 53 of the world's most interesting minds
  writing on the future of technology, business and
  society. 

I'm still working my way through it, but this is a good cross-section of
mainstream thinking on many of the issues with which we are concerned.

been best furthered by gay fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries
and then went roistering down the highways of the world, proving to all
men that doubt, after all, was safe - that the god in the sanctuary was a
fraud. One horse-laugh is worth ten-thousand syllogisms."

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

On the Fortune magazine web site there is an article dated December 9, 1996
and entitled "What It's Really Like to Be Marc Andreessen"
by Rick Tetzeli and reporter associate Shaifali Puri
http://pathfinder.com/@@rFqKFgYAmks5Cgzj/fortune/1996/961209/and.html

The article provides some insight into Marc Andreessen's viewpoint about
nanotechnology. Note, Andreessen is now worth more than 100 million and
potentially could fund research into nanotechnology. Specifically, the
article claims:

   Andreessen has sold at least 500,000 Netscape shares worth $28 million.
   He still has 1.5 million shares, worth $82 million, in which he is 60%
   vested.

The last sentence of the article which is quoted below is interesting I
think.

Begin excerpt from Fortune article:

But Andreessen is more focused on two other time frames: the here and now,
and the way far out. What's next is an open question. 

As for the way far out, he has plenty to say about it. One of his favorite
novels is The Diamond Age, by Neal Stephenson. Its plot is built around
nanotechnology, the science of manipulating individual atoms to build
devices and circuits. Although nanotechnology is being taken more and more
seriously, its possibilities seem positively chimerical. At its extreme,
nanotechnology would allow us to create stuff--anything from a chair to a
blimp--out of practically nothing. "So many of the things people do are
going to be unnecessary when matter can be rearranged arbitrarily," says
Andreessen. "I mean, this gets into all kinds of bizarre stuff.
Immortality. There's no fundamental reason why the breakdown of cell
structures is inevitable." 

He pauses to sip some iced tea, waiting to see if I've heard correctly.
"There's no reason..." I begin. 

"There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason
decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be
able to design exactly the body you want." 

"Well," I say, "there's no reason I should be unhappy." 

"That raises a very philosophical question," he says. He seems exhausted, or
perhaps disappointed by my skepticism. He slows down for a second.  "Well,
at the very least the concept of manufacturing goes away." 

It's one of those asides that make hanging out with Andreessen so
interesting. But it also makes you wonder if this guy's too far out, too
undisciplined, too young to keep Netscape in the big time. It makes you
wonder if he can play in the same league as Gates. 

...

The article ends with the following two paragraphs.

...

As for Gates, well, Andreessen isn't sure the man in Seattle has a clear
sense of the road ahead. "Microsoft is doing things that are not rational
for a company in a leadership position," he says. "They define their culture
as one where they deliberately try to destroy competitors as their primary
way of doing business. The generally accepted strategy for a market leader
is to grow the market, not to wipe out the remaining 10%. It may take years,
but fundamentally their strategy is flawed." 

By then, Andreessen figures he may have other options. "You know," he says,
"within 30 years someone's going to make a shitload of money in nanotech."

If you aren't currently subscribed to the extropians mailing list,
please accept my apologies and notify me (david@kumo.com) immediately.

As most of you have surmised by now, the extropians list broke
earlier this week. Unfortunately the exact nature of the error wasn't 
caught in time to restore the subscription list from the nightly backups, 
so I've had to reconstruct the list from old backups, recent subscription
requests, and a list of everyone who has posted to the list in the
last 3 months. Consequently there are some old e-mail addresses and
some duplicates that should be unsubscribed. You can send me mail, use the
web-based interface at http://www.lucifer.com/cgi-bin/exi-lists or
send a message to extropians-request@extropy.org with the following
two commands:

unsubscribe extropians <old-email-address>
end

(The "end" command tells the list server to not attempt to interpret
your .sig as commands.)

If anyone has recently sent a "who extropians" command to the list
server and saved the reply, please send it to me as it will be useful
in restoring subscribers who may have been accidently dropped from
the list.

You many want to check out the mailing list archives at
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/date00.html to see
if you have missed any messages this week.

Rest assured I'm taking steps to ensure this type of error doesn't 
happen again and please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience.

        Indeed, I think we tend to take this list for granted...until
something goes wrong.  David does a great job of keeping the list going (I'm
not sure about the technical aspects), and is rarely thanked or given much
credit.  Hopefully this doesn't sound *too* effusive, but I second Natasha's
thanks toward David for getting things happening and putting in effort when
things go awry; not many people would take the time to delve into old
subscription and backup files just to 'resubscribe' members.

Or like corporations use their employees; or like armies use soldiers.  
It is instructive to substitute "corporation" for "being" in David's post, 
and see what the result looks like:

An "advanced being" will necessarily use humans for various tasks.  
An advanced being will amount to the same thing as a corporation (or 
possibly an army or state or church).  It is an illusion to think that 
there is such a thing as an "advanced being" which does not incorporate 
humans within it.

Actually I was thinking of the idea of all of Los Angeles County creating a

grass seed in as well.

Sure it wasn't just a placebo effect? All the paranoia put on by the media
when it first debut was enough to make anyone paranoid enough not to drink
any of it. Are you actually allergic or merely under a placebo effect and
was temporarily under a media-induced hypochondria?

The movie itself I believe is very optimistic and uplifting in the sense
and puts the message across that "WE WILL GO OUT THERE!". Hey Mike, Keep
working on that Lorrey Drive! After seeing Geordi's new eyes on "Star Trek:
First Contact" I am beginning to wonder how long it will be before we can
design and create mechanical eyes to allow the blind to see or for our own
augmentation? Also has anyone ever thought of putting together an
organization that would show up at trekkie conventions and create a fund to
pump into R&D for space travel? I myself am not a dedicated trekkie but I
do watch it from time to time.

IAN: That's why gorillas have such bad eyesight. :)
 
But what does it mean "the amount is less than a banana" ? 
What amount ?  Most nutra-sweet containing beverages have
it listed as the second or third ingredient. As I've read,
it's 10% methanol. This seems pretty high over all, espe-
cially if you consider some people drink 6 cans a day. 
I suspect the consumption of nutra-sweet exceeds 
on average the consumption of bananas. 

And anyways, just because bananas may contain an 
agent that is harmful does not mean that that agent
is no longer harmful simply because we think of 
bananas as healthy. Pretty simple logic. It
could be that bananas have so much good
stuff--they do--it counters the bad.

No I haddn't heard any negative stuff. I though it was gonna be the
greatest stuff on earth. Besides, 3 days is a little bit beyond what
even a placebo effect could do, and I've never been a hypochondriac (ow
that hurts!)

Extropians may want to check out the November 18, 1996 edition of Forbes
magazine.  The cover story is entitled "Cyber Power", by Peter Huber.  Here's
the description of the article from the magazine's web site:

  Modern, electronically connected markets
  are more powerful than any politician.

The article expresses some of the ideas that have been very influential in
this forum for a long time regarding the erosion of territorially-based
nation-states in the face of electronic commerce.  Yet another sign of our
ideas making it into the mainstream.

Also, in a separate Forbes publication, "Forbes ASAP":

  Now on newstands, the Forbes ASAP "Big
  Issue". 53 of the world's most interesting minds
  writing on the future of technology, business and
  society. 

I'm still working my way through it, but this is a good cross-section of
mainstream thinking on many of the issues with which we are concerned.

Caffeine (look it up), in my book.  Both are alkaloids, but nicotine is
much more toxic and much more addictive.  One develops tolerance to both,
though since I haven't tried nicotine I don't know how fast that one comes
on.

BTW, I'm assuming you're contemplating something like a patch.  Smoking
speeds nicotine out of the realm of "unwise", passes through "entropic"
without slowing down, and comes to rest somewhere downstream of "damned
stupid".  That inteligence and will are largely unrelated is the only
explanation I can find for those of my (undeniably intelligent) friends
who haven't been able to beat that monkey off their backs yet.

Personally, I tend to avoid caffeine except in cases of emergency, too
(I narrowly avoided a chocolate-covered espresso bean habit), just
because of the tolerance effect.  I want it to work when I need it.

Incidentally, you might get more interesting answers from "What's a
[legal, nonaddictive, powerful, fast-acting, nonprescription, cheap,
whatever your constraints are] nootropic?".

Heh. Under some circumstances, intelligence and will are inversely
proportional to each other. Check my guide to intelligence enhancement
using current technology, under "Countersphexist". 

http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon.html#counter

The emotion of frustration greatly reduces your will to continue, but
also invokes the cognitive functions of causal analysis and creative
design.

I don't know if this would work as a general rule, but somebody ought to
check and see if willpower varies with the inverse of SAT scores. (Just
SAT scores - IQ tests, for example, won't work.)

P.S: I'm not a smoker, but I am an Algernon.

        Extropian artwork --visual and other, copies of Extropy Magazine,
Michael Lorrey's upcoming book, books that contain 'extropianesque' themes
and ideas e.g.: "The Physics Of Immortality" by Tipler, nanotechnology books
by Drexler and Regis, books by Moravec, Leary, FM-2030 (and Efstantiary),
Walford...you get the idea.  T-shirts, supplements like DHEA etc., donations
to various institutes.
You could even throw cryonic suspension packages in there! <g>  Maybe a
raffle?  The possibilities are nearly endless.  The problem with this is
that it *might* cheapen the philosophy.  At a 'fiction' convention, extropy
might seem like a 'nice thought' as opposed to an active philosophy.  If we
want extropianism to be publicized, we want it to be done seriously...and
well; otherwise, most people will turn their noses up at what seems
unattainable or unrealistic.

        Take "Star Trek" for example.  I'm sure that show has many good
ideas presented in it (I rarely watch television), but looking at the mass
publicity of the show, it is apparent that the 'trekkies' can discern that
it is fiction.  Extropy is *not* fiction, and it would be a shame to see it
perceived as such.  My point is that if we (as extropian types) are going to
bring our philosophy to the forefront in a way that can be grokked by the
average individual, we have to do it tastefully and tactfully.  We have the
goods and the knowledge, but we have to convey them carefully, lest extropy
appear a cult to the untrained eye.

My eye doctor told me that if someone is truly blind (e.g., the retina is
destroyed), then the optic nerve dies.  Therefore, it would not be possible
to replace the entire eye *unless* you invent a way to bypass the optic
nerve.

Yes, I would especially like to discuss the articles by Tom Wolfe and
George Gilder.  He and Wolfe attack materialism in general, and Richard
Dawkins in particular.  Gilder argues that real technological progress
requires belief in absolute truth and objective morality (which he also
links to belief in God).

There is also Bill Frezza's essay about the possibility of creating a
tax-free economy in cyberspace.

In a message dated 96-11-24 02:58:55 EST, you write:

<< But what does it mean "the amount is less than a banana" ? >>

We will have to let them tell us what they mean.  The amount probably be will
be measured in Methanol concentration by weight or by volume the same as it
is measured in other foods and beverages.  I like by weight better, w/w.  It
could also be measured in milligrams percent,  milligrams per 100 grams or
parts per million.  
   
<< What amount ? >>

The Methanol from a NutraSweet sweetened product could be compared to the
amount derived from a banana based on percent w/w concentration.  I think
bananas have less than 1 percent w/w total alcohols and much less than that
is methanol, but I don't know exactly how much less.  The journal _Food
Technology_ (I think) had an article I read on this some years ago.  

<< Most nutra-sweet containing beverages have
 it listed as the second or third ingredient. As I've read,
 it's 10% methanol. >>

You can't go by that.  That would be the raw Asparatame material and not the
concentration in the beverage.  From my work in the food industry less than
one gram of NutraSweet is dissolved per 355 grams of soda, so <1gram per 356
total grams x 100 is <0.28 percent NutraSweet w/w.  Then, 10% (I assume you
are sure of this, I didn't check) of <0.28 percent is concentration of
 <0.028 percent w/w Methanol (actually a breakdown product (not "in")
NutraSweet).

Now,  what does a banana have?  Greater to? or equal to? or less than <0.028
percent methanol concentration?

<<This seems pretty high over all, espe-
 cially if you consider some people drink 6 cans a day. 
 I suspect the consumption of nutra-sweet exceeds 
 on average the consumption of bananas. >>

Very true, for some.  (I can't stand NS myself). Lets take the <0.028 % w/w
methanol times six (6 cans, Oh, yuck!)  is  0.17 percent w/w methanol.  So,
we could compare 0.17% w/w Methanol in 6 sodas sweetened with NutraSweet to
the percent w/w concentration of Methanol in a banana.  

<< And anyways, just because bananas may contain an 
 agent that is harmful does not mean that that agent
 is no longer harmful simply because we think of 
 bananas as healthy. >>  

True, but it would go a very long way to _suggest_ epidemiologically the
methanol concentration IS safe.  I don't know of any metabolic pathway that
shows a lower concentration of Methanol will cause more problems than a
higher concentration.  Of course, methanol is toxic in a high enough
concentration.  The question is not methanol, per se,  the question is the
concentration and the metabolic pathways.  

<<Pretty simple logic. It
 could be that bananas have so much good
 stuff--they do--it counters the bad.  >>

Ha Ha.  Now, I know your just kidding around ;-)  

Good post.

Sorry for posting this to the list, folks.  I'm not a member of the list.  I
received a confirmation from your list manager and the output from your list
server indicating that I had been unsubscribed.  As a result, I tossed the
details describing the list crash and how some of us "visitors" might have
been accidentally subscribed.  Please unsubsribe me from your list.  I know
this sounds pathetic, but not being a regular subsriber, I never received
the details for subbing and unsubbing.

Anyway, I do want y'all to know that I really enjoyed the tip about the
"cyberpower" article in Forbes magazine.  Right up my alley.

<<  At a 'fiction' convention, >>

I know science fiction (SF) has gotten the "sci-fi" bad name because of all
the non-"hard" science fiction written now.  I'm talking about what Ben Bova
and Stanley Schmidt (Analog) describes about  sci-fi :  non-science fantasy
and mystical stories or stories that would not collapse even if all the
science was taken out.  I might tell people I write amateur SF or actually
say "hard science fiction. "  I don't want myself to be associated with
sci-fi.  On the other hand, look at the cover of the current Extropy and tell
me that's not appealing to New Agers.  So, what's the big deal? Lets have a
booth at a Star Trek or science fiction convention. 

<<extropy
 might seem like a 'nice thought' as opposed to an active philosophy.  If we
 want extropianism to be publicized, we want it to be done seriously...>>

I lot of people take science fiction seriously, esp. Star Trek.

<and  well; >>

Many conventions are done well and we _would_ have control over our booth,
right?

<otherwise, most people will turn their noses up at what seems
 unattainable or unrealistic. >>

People don't avoid science fiction even if it is unattainable or unrealistic.
 People want to associate themselves with a positive optimistic future even
if they don't think they will see it attained.  I'm sure a lot of people
(pessimistically) didn't think they would see a Moon landing in their
lifetime.  There _will_ be those kind of people.  I would not want to slow
ExI's extropy because of the pessimistic people.  


Dynamically Optimistic,
Davin

 If you know that A can only have values 0 or 1, then the proof works
the same as without fuzzy logic. If A can reasonably take on other
values, why would you want ~[~A] to imply A = 1?

I dunno about that but the friend I went with who is a total trekkie said
that he'd pitch in some cash as well to fuel the funding of R&D for space
travel. I would also think that they would definately pitch in some cash
after just watching "Star Trek: First Contact" because the plotline had
alot to do with creating the first warp drive and making first contact with
the first alien race we'd ever met and how it united the world. (don't want
to spoil who the first contact was but anyone familiar with Star Trek TOS
or TNG can pretty much figure it out)

	Point your browser to this address:

It's the May issue of the IEEE Spectrum, they discuss this very topic.  I
also recall hearing of work being done on a processor that floats on the
retina and interprets incoming signals and passes them on to the optic
nerve, for the visually impaired (though I could imagine many
opportunities for augmentation, not just repair and restoration). I don't
recall what that is from (I've gone through back issues of most of the
journals that it could be in), anyone have any idea?

Tell you what, I'll have my Lorrey Drive prototype finished definitely
by the next WorldCon, so if Extropy wants to jump in, I'll lend the demo
unit as a OOOOOOH WOW attractor. Booths are typically between $750-2000
for a 10x10 space, plus fees for props power etc.

Ok, well now we'll *HAVE* to go through with it! Imagine the ooh's and

Actually I think they're simply ideas rediscovered by people with more
fame. We need to go public more often to spread our memes ANY WAY
POSSIBLE!! I strongly point in the direction of having a booth at Trekkie
conventions.

How much is destroyed? Does it have little atrophied remains or is it gone
completely? I've read that a damaged blinded eye can still tell the
difference between night and day and communicates that information back to
the brain whereas people where the eye was removed due to complete
destruction of the eye have problems with insomnia so this points in the
direction of an atrophied optic nerve. Perhaps with some type of
genengineered cell or nanites we can create a new optic nerve by pulling a
strand from the brain?

Well, it seems that nobody has mentioned the easy way to deal with the 
possible ill effects of aspartame-derive methanol: ingest some ethanol 
too. It makes the methanol metabolism slower and blocks the formaldehyde 
production (this is in fact the standard treatment for methanol 
poisoning). No, ethanol in small doses is not dangerous, although it is 
energy-rich and reduces inhibitions - you have to fit it into the 
metabolic and neurochemical program you use. Definitely not suitable for 
Calorie Restriction.

Placebo can definitely do things like 3 days of insomnia or headaches (in 
some cases it can kill or send cancer into remission, after all). It is a 
surprisingly powerful force in some people (others are almost completely 
indifferent to it).

According to what I have read (and heard), the nootropic effect of 
nicotine appears as part of the addiction process (the number of 
cholinergic receptors increase). This is bad news, since you have to 
become addicted to get any benefits (yes, there are documented nootropic 
effects; do a medline search!), and you also develops a tolerance (in 
addition, even non-smoked nicotine is carcinogenous).

True. As a complete caffeine-sugar addict, I sometimes try to take a break 
from my daily Coca Colas just to increase their potency when I need them.

We believe in the One Power
Who will make the great transform
transcending us all;
the best and brightest, eternally replicated,
through Whom all things are changed.

For us and for our salvation,
we must solve all the problems of the world
here and now.
We must disdain any link with
suboptimal subsystems of the past.
We must be the future, now.

For our sake we will be frozen and adamant,
insisting on only the best from this world,
the fluid ease of evolution resisted.
In any case, we shall come again,
always judging both the living and the dead,
in a kingdom that will have no end.

We believe in the Singularity Allmighty,
which will transport us to infinity and beyond,
to all that is now uncountable and inconceivable
(transforming the KnownNet overnight).

With the Powers and Omega,
the Singularity is expected and glorified.
The spirit of the Web speaks through
the invisible hand of the market,
and we are transfixed.

We acknowledge commitment to
endless expansion,
wait for the insurrection of uploads,
with atom-by-atom Nanotech control
of the life of the world to come.

Amen (and on to Alef-one!)

I was thinking about this too. 
1. Entropians love to
propigate a "lack" mentality, for without the sense of hopelessness - it is
harder to impose limits on people. 

2. I get a lot of lunches and dinners free, and it is the 
great pleasure of those who dine with me to provide them. 
And I am happy to do the same for anyone who is very fun to talk to. Or very
pretty to look at, for that matter ; - )
Now this doesnt mean that you should freeload or we need to abandon the
notion that trading and exchange should and can be beneficial to both
parties, but the negativity behind these little sayings can be subconsciously
daunting.

3. Life is full of thess little catch phases-homilies, old 
wives tales, fables.... a meme, a myth...
the benefit would be, parents and elders can tell us our
limits, try to warn us, I guess...
But I avoid them all, and even try to avoid repetitious,
obviously pat,  thoughts of my *own*. If I have decided
 "it is so", and invented a little mental script, I am probably atrophy
prone.
There are to many NEW patterns to explore to get stuck 
on old ones.

Lets give credit where credit is due.
This was Chris Hind's idea, not mine, OK?... I only 
replied, asking him if he had the resourses and time 
for such a project, and what he would sell to make it worth the time..
 Mike then replied to that double message ( to Queen:)

Bruce Bower writes in the 11/02/96 Science News

about "Bridging the Brain Gap: A scientist explores the biology of isolated

J. Freeman of Berkeley and the theories he elaborates in his 1995 book, 
_Societies of Brains_:
<[T] ansient electrical responses to sensation may preface life-altering 
changes in the brain, he
proposes.... Freeman hopes to nudge neuroscientists toward a consideration 
of what brains do in
groups, not just inside individual skulls... [B]rain science is in crisis 
because our models
neglect the most important function of human brains, which is to interact 
with each other
to form families and societies," Freeman contends.... The Berkeley 
researcher also rejects the view, widespread in cognitive psychology, that 
the mind contains representations of the world in the form of thoughts, 
ideas, images, and symbols that are processed according to sets of rules.>

Freeman contends that mind only emerges at the crossroads of perception, 
action and learning.  His studies, particularly research on EEGs in 
rabbits, indicate that mammalian brains are constantly being 'rewired' as 
life situations change.  Thus, the common transhumanist notion that 
uploading our minds to a digital media will somehow give us a qualitatively 
NEW way to transform ourselves may be somewhat of a myth.

        Before I get to the reason of this post, I must say how nice it is
to see the latest written artwork\poetry that has been appearing much more
frequently on this list.  I urge everyone who has any presentable artwork to
present it...both to the list and anywhere possible.  This is one sure way
of increasing people's interest and knowledge of our philosophy.  As I said
in a post about six weeks ago, if the average person sees artwork that they
like, they are bound to query it and look into it further.  There are
millions upon millions of people who would warm to extropy and transhumanism
if it was presented to them...art is a great way to do this.

        Anyway, here is the crux of the post --a poem I wrote about a week
ago.  It was heavily inspired by a poem by T.S. Eliot called "The Hollow
Men".  When reading this poem, please look at the last two lines in relation
to the whole poem; the lines on their own could appear to hold some
semblance of mysticism.  Enough rambling...





          UNITY


I was a young man of eighty-two
When Death took my love from me,
I asked where she did go,
He replied: "o'er the sea";
With nary a second glance
The two, they disappeared,
And I doggedly made a vow
That I would cheat the force I feared;
Determined, I set my plans
To live an eternity,
Invested in many kinds
Of extension technology;
When I reached one hundred and five
I saw immortality on the brink,
Machines to help me live,
Computers to help me think;
Gradually I was restored
To the equivalence of youth,
With my consciousness unimpaired
And the knowledge of a simple truth;
At the age of one forty-six
I am really only a child,
With so much more to learn,
My Life has me beguiled;
My love has long been dead,
Long been o'er the sea,
But the memory of her Life
Forever lives inside of me
For I know I have cheated Death,
Beat Him at His own game,
I have seen the beautiful truth:
Death and Life are one and the same

so it's not insignificant relative to those other contents,
which are present in lower concentrations.

IAN: Well, I can't say that was a joke. For
example: if I consume a lot of oxidizing agents
(bad) and then I do *not* consume a lot of anti-
oxidizing,  I get the full force of the bad
(minus endogenous anti-oxs), but if I consume
the bad *and* consume a lot of anti-oxidizing
agents (good), then the good counter the bad. 
Is that not so?

	If you are looking for the effects that nicotine provides, why not
take a route that is much safer?  Try choline/B-5 supplementing (around
3000mg/600mg daily should have the intented effect) or DMAE.  The only
drawback would be that with choline/b-5, you would not recieve an instant
rush like you may with nicotine (I have no personal experience with
nicotine, but I believe this to be true), and with the DMAE one would
build a tolerance, but that is bound to happen with nicotine as well.  I
think that one must decide which is more important, getting a quick rush
and being alert for a brief interval of time, or operating on an alert and
rational/clear level all of the time.  You are bound to get used to either
after a while, but with the latter, not feeling it does not imply that it
is not working.  They all work in the cholinergic system, creating and
filling acetylcholine receptors, some are just safer than others.

I saw something on this on the Discovery channel.  It was pretty
interesting.  They have been currently experimenting with 8 x 8 sensor
arrays, but they believe they can achieve a much higher sensor density than
this.  The difficulty is attaching the electronic device to the nervous
system.  It is currently done by surgically attaching nerves to fine wires
on the backside of the device.  The person then has to "learn" to organize
the inputs into a coherent pattern.

What I find interesting is that the nervous system can adapt to the input
device without us having any knowledge of which neuron should be attached
where.  The brain sorts out the interface all by itself.  Admittedly the
current 8x8 resolution is kind of low, but very useful if you are blind, and
onboard logic does some processing for the device.  Note however, that an
external power supply is required.

As far as augmentation goes, reportedly the device allowed the test subjects
to see well into the infrared range and in extremely low light levels.  This
is a consequence of the sensor technology, and not really an intentional
goal of the device.  It would be a useful augmentation though!

Thanks for straightening things out! Really I should show up to one of

It's true, the idea that the past existed has not been proved and probably 
can never be proven, but I don't demand proof for everything I believe, 
nobody could live that way. Until somebody comes up with a better idea I 
would be most reluctant to abandon The Past Hypothesis, because if I did 
I would also have to give up a tool that is even more important than logic 
in helping me understand how the world works, Induction. Without Induction I
would be hopelessly confused and be unable to protect myself from any of the 
dangers that are lurking everywhere in the environment. Without Induction 
I would undoubtedly do something stupid and be dead in minutes if not seconds, 
that's why evolution gave it to us, animals who lacked it were unable to
reproduce their genes. If the Past Hypothesis is a fiction it is a very 
useful fiction.

The God Hypothesis on the other hand does not give me a corresponding tool of 
vast power like Induction, it does not give me any tool at all, it just 
generates wheels within wheels. Personally I think the world is hard enough 
to understand as it is and I see no point in adding complications when there 
is no payoff for doing so. If The God Hypothesis is the truth it is a
useless truth.

First of all, this Freeman character is either misrepresented (in the
article) or a crackpot, probably the former. That article wasn't
cognitive science, it was New Age philosophy with a slightly larger
syllable count.

Leaving that aside, at present there is no conscious entity redesigning
its brain on a neuron-by-neuron basis. There is a limited amount of
neural power available to the brain. No more than, say, 7.5 meg of
information is used to build the thing (assuming 1% of the genome is
devoted.) We are evolved to hunt and gather, not do mathematics or
design computers.

http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#PT describes how to build an
intuitive understanding of numbers into a Power, or how the Powers might
view the whole of human knowledge in a single flash of experience, and
how to continue the process. The basic concept is that of a "Perceptual
Transcend", which occurs when the semantic structures become semantic
primitives.

All in all, I'd say that uploading to computer presents a tremendous
range of new possibilities.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

 The mailing list was apparently incapacitated when I previously sent the
note below. I think extropians will find it interesting hence I am resending
it. Apologies if you have seen it before.

On the Fortune magazine web site there is an article dated December 9, 1996
and entitled "What It's Really Like to Be Marc Andreessen"
by Rick Tetzeli and reporter associate Shaifali Puri
http://pathfinder.com/@@rFqKFgYAmks5Cgzj/fortune/1996/961209/and.html

The article provides some insight into Marc Andreessen's viewpoint about
nanotechnology. Note, Andreessen is now worth more than 100 million and
potentially could fund research into nanotechnology. Specifically, the
article claims:

   Andreessen has sold at least 500,000 Netscape shares worth $28 million.
   He still has 1.5 million shares, worth $82 million, in which he is 60%
   vested.

The last sentence of the article which is quoted below is interesting I
think.

Begin excerpt from Fortune article:

But Andreessen is more focused on two other time frames: the here and now,
and the way far out. What's next is an open question. 

As for the way far out, he has plenty to say about it. One of his favorite
novels is The Diamond Age, by Neal Stephenson. Its plot is built around
nanotechnology, the science of manipulating individual atoms to build
devices and circuits. Although nanotechnology is being taken more and more
seriously, its possibilities seem positively chimerical. At its extreme,
nanotechnology would allow us to create stuff--anything from a chair to a
blimp--out of practically nothing. "So many of the things people do are
going to be unnecessary when matter can be rearranged arbitrarily," says
Andreessen. "I mean, this gets into all kinds of bizarre stuff.
Immortality. There's no fundamental reason why the breakdown of cell
structures is inevitable." 

He pauses to sip some iced tea, waiting to see if I've heard correctly.
"There's no reason..." I begin. 

"There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason
decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be
able to design exactly the body you want." 

"Well," I say, "there's no reason I should be unhappy." 

"That raises a very philosophical question," he says. He seems exhausted, or
perhaps disappointed by my skepticism. He slows down for a second.  "Well,
at the very least the concept of manufacturing goes away." 

It's one of those asides that make hanging out with Andreessen so
interesting. But it also makes you wonder if this guy's too far out, too
undisciplined, too young to keep Netscape in the big time. It makes you
wonder if he can play in the same league as Gates. 

...

The article ends with the following two paragraphs.

...

As for Gates, well, Andreessen isn't sure the man in Seattle has a clear
sense of the road ahead. "Microsoft is doing things that are not rational
for a company in a leadership position," he says. "They define their culture
as one where they deliberately try to destroy competitors as their primary
way of doing business. The generally accepted strategy for a market leader
is to grow the market, not to wipe out the remaining 10%. It may take years,
but fundamentally their strategy is flawed." 

By then, Andreessen figures he may have other options. "You know," he says,
"within 30 years someone's going to make a shitload of money in nanotech."

BIG SMILE AT LYLE

I was not telling you ABOUT sexism, I was commenting on your yours, at that
moment. If you must know I am not politically correct at all.  

Who said I wanted to have sex with those pretty people? I was talking about
eating food with them and enjoying looking at them...

Asethetics are my cup of tea, FYI

I certainly wouldnt require payment in sexual favors at the end of the

It's a lovely poem, but as an official credo, the 
enemies of extropianism will love it to no end. 
They will wave it about as proof of cultic zealotry. 
Many be these things that are part of extropian 
thought are all wrong and will not or cannot come 
to pass. ??  Does daring to think that make one 
not an extropian?  I should hope not !

TANSTAAFL is the acronym for "There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch." which was coined by Robert Heinlein in his novel _The_Moon_is _a
_Harsh_Mistress_, and is the national motto of the Lunar Republic
founded in the novel. it is also known by many engineers as a slang way
of describing the Laws of Thermodynamics, Motion, and Energy. It is a
favorite of Libertarians who are sci-fi fans, as it is also a great
short description of the Libertarian Party Platform, which explains why
so many Libertarians are Scientists and Engineers, and vice versa.

For myself, the Lorrey Drive is a new propulsion technology which
challenges peoples commonly held perceptions of these laws, but does not
violate them one iota, in fact it relies on them to achieve its
performance. For people who do not understand or cannot believe that it
works, it is my way of adamantly saying "I am not a quack, and I'll
prove it to you."

Its funny, so many people in this world will easily believe that they
they deserve a free lunch, but cannot believe that space travel is easy.

It is used by cynics and debunkers who think they are smart, but only
because they are so stupid they don't know how much they don't know.

I see it as the numero uno rule for living. There is always a catch. If
you really want to create a new paradigm, you've got to figure out how
to solve your equation for all possibilities. People who do not look for
the catch, usually get caught, and bit in the ass to boot. A programmer
who doesn't work out all the bugs is simply putting garbage out. To me
it is entropic to avoid dealing with potential pitfalls, because if you
havent prepared for them, you won't be able to handle them when they
rear their ugly heads, and youwon't be able to respond to the
intelligent naysayers who point out the failings you haven't spotted.

That is a possibility, but in my discussions with the founders of LRC,
they seemed not too open minded about my technology (after all, almost
all of them work for NASA). I do expect to be providing them services
with an Orbital Transfer Vehicle, however, when it becomes available, as
my services seem to be the only ones they could probably afford. Their
fundraising plans keep going higher, but they don't seem to be able to 
raise any money, despite an awesome website and well developed
operational plans.

I would say that Induction is a great way to help using the Past
Hypothesis as a tool to deal with the present. What would be a good tool
to use the God Hypothesis constructively to deal with the future?

I think that you have missed the whole point of TANSTAAFL. Its purpose (an
excellent one to my mind) is to remind us all that, one way or another, we DO
always earn and pay for everything we get. In the above example you have
prepaid (or earned) your "free" lunches and dinners by educating and refining
the quality and appeal of the person you are. In addition, there is involved
here different kinds of value, some monetary and some non-monetary
(spiritual?). So there is really no question of needing to abandon the ideas of
trade to mutual advantage even in this context. A wider question which I would
like to see discussed in a thread (maybe is has been before, I am new to the
list) would be whether all of a person's values are even commensurable (and
therefore can be evaluated in terms of money).

But I don't agree that they should *all* be written off and ignored. Certainly,
most are either useless, misleading, or even grossly harmful. However, some of
them (and TANSTAAFL) is one such, play a very useful role as a concise summing
up of some very fundamental logical or reality ideas. Two that come immediately
to mind which I particularly like and value are "It's a chicken and egg
problem" and "You can't see the forrest for the trees"

Again, I don't agree. Yes, one should not get "stuck on" old patterns. But
neither should one abandon "truths", just because they are old.

According to what I read in (I think it was) Smart Drugs, caffeine
definitely accelerates thinking, and boosts peformance at logical,
mathematical reasoning, including tasks like computer programming. However,
some study indicated that it may reduce the ability to find patterns in
ambiguous or unclear data. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but it may
suggest caffeine could make it harder to form clear ideas from the haze, as
when you're trying to get ideas to coalesce for a piece of writing.

Q:
..if you read the first lines above...I dint miss it, I 
sideswiped it ; - )
I think "sayings" like this, used in interpersonal 
relationships,  even if meaningful in the beginning, 
soon become overshadowed by the nearsightedness of
*this useful business equation*. In PRINCIPLE, this homily 
is useful, in PRACTISE  ( IMHO) it leaves out a lot of
wonderful scenarios, including feelings, not paid for 
or bought.


>Its purpose (an
excellent one to my mind) is to remind us all that, one way or another, we DO
always earn and pay for everything we get. In the above example you have
prepaid (or earned) your "free" lunches and dinners by educating and refining
>the quality and appeal of the person you are. 

Maybe so, in YOUR eyes, But I would be highly insulted 
if you offered me the money for dinner instead of free
food, and the "exchange" (if any) sure ain't the cost of the
food, ( I can buy my own, thank U) it's your company!
So therefore I agree with the next :

>In addition, there is involved
here different kinds of value, some monetary and some non-monetary
(spiritual?). So there is really no question of needing to abandon the ideas
of
trade to mutual advantage even in this context. A wider question which I
would
like to see discussed in a thread (maybe is has been before, I am new to the
list) would be whether all of a person's values are even commensurable (and
therefore can be evaluated in terms of money).
>

Is it ever useful to equate all of our dealings, no matter 
how delicate , with the business venture? It is certainly
SAFE, and comfortable, and capitalism is a very rewarding game, one I admire
and aspire to. But I leave the
boardroom out of the bedroom and out of my close
friendships.

And, I think a  lot of people use sayings like this 
incorrectly to excuse bad behavior or fear of letting
other people in to their hearts.

Furthermore, all "truisms" lose meaning out of or in certain context.

if so, then you would be giving the lunch buyer the ego satisfaction of
being magnanimous in exchange for the lunch.

If they bought you lunch cause they like being with you, they are
recieving services in kind, i.e. entertainment. When I lived in Seattle,
I usually was taken to lunch or dinner by freinds 3 times more often
than I was able to reciprocate, because I was 1) an entertaining guy, 2)
the only person who would hang out with them, 3) people were interested
in me or my company for business reasons. In each case, I wound up
paying for it one way or another.

ALL human relationships are based on free trade, which can be quantified
economically, or qualified emotionally.

I usually found that the biggest free lunches always had the biggest
costs for me in the end.....

Suffice it to say, I'm back in New Hampshire as much for the splendid
isolation it provides, as for nearness to family.

		DMAE is a naturally occuring compound found mostly in
fish.

	Quote from alt.psychoactives:

		"DMAE is basically a choline molecule with one methyl
group missing from the nitrogen.  DMAE is more able to cross the
blood-brain barrier than choline.  Once inside the brain, an enzyme
performs a methylation that converts DMAE into choline", then choline into
acetylcholine.  The benefit is that you can "absorb" more, leading to a
higher concentration already in the brain and increasing the odds for
boosting your acetylcholine levels.
It is also known as Deanol-Riker.

I need specifics on that NOW. Actually, I don't. I bet I know what they
were studying, even if they didn't.

They found that caffeine improves performance on tasks that require
long, linear chains of causality to be worked out.

But it impaired tasks that required causal analysis, or finding root
causes.

And it does this... Because caffeine increases your level of mental
energy. It's a minor version of what I described under:
http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon.html#pearce
when I speculated about what the side effects of increased mental energy
would be. I want specifics so I can claim this as a scientific
prediction.

I'll never drink anything with caffeine in it again. I feel like such a
moron. I should have been able to figure that out from first principles.
I guess I just didn't think about it.

Excuse me, but this is not poetry.  It doesn't scan.  It has no structure.  
Writing prose in short lines doesn't make it into poetry.  

Maybe this "poem" was intended as a parody of Extropian non-art.    
I hope so.

Or perhaps the friends of extropianism might wave it about as an 
example of what extropianism should not become.  It should be about 
what we want to accomplish, not about what we "believe in".  Faith is 
anathema to reason.  Reason is necessary for progress.  The world has 
more than enough religions already.  Why create another one?

Once upon a time, in the extropians FAQ, I wrote "extropians have no
sense of humor, none whatsoever". Of course, I intended this as a joke,
but the various reactions to Mark Crosby's excellent parody are making
me start to think that a few people have taken that bit in the FAQ way
too seriously.

But then again, Lyle doesn't consider himself an extropian, so maybe he
really does lack a sense of humor. It certainly seems that way
sometimes. I wonder what he would make of Tim May's "Rapture of the
Future" polemic.

Why stop there?  My friend Jaga, the Hare Krishna devotee, told me 
she used to collect more than a thousand dollars a day at the Denver 
Airport; several thousand on a good day.  And that was more than 20 
years ago, when a thousand dollars was more money than it is now.  

Chris, why don't you go to the L.A. airport, wearing an Extropy t-shirt 
or some kind of Extropian costume (use your imagination), and ask for 
donations?  

You can also just go to public places and approach people.  In the 
1970s the Moonies developed this into a science.  They seem to have 
faded away, but Christian evangelists still approach people.  Last 
summer I spent a lot of time in Huntington Beach.  One afternoon I was 
approached five different times by Christians who wanted me to come 
to a revival meeting.  The fifth time, when the guy asked me if I was a 
Christian, I said "No, I'm a Satanist," and a very interesting conversation 
ensued.  

There is no use being shy.  Go public!  Spread your memes ANY WAY 
POSSIBLE!!

Personally, I believe that there _is_ such a thing as free verse; the
lines must not just be short, they must have rhythm to them.

I also find much of the poetry that has been appearing here rather
tedious, because the rhythms are often approximate at best, and the
rhymes seem forced.  Too bad for me; no poet requires that I like
his/her poetry.

Can we call it a matter of taste and get on with life?  Wrangling
about "proper" art reminds me of one of the things I dislike about
Ayn Rand.

Some speculation from an amateur cognitive scientist: this seems to be
similar to the problem many people with eidetic memories have: their
memories do not generalize well, and hence do not form a coherent picture,
just an endless pile of clear images (for an extreme imaginary example,
read Borge's story "Fuentes"). 

Our memories are rather fuzzy, and usually contain more of our
elaborations on experiences than the experiences themselves. This way we
link them together into association chains and "the whole picture". Smart
drugs may make imprinting memories much easier, creating eidetic-like
memories that "stand alone". This is a bit like rote learning, where you
cram your head with facts (very easy using mnemotechniques) but cannot use
them, just recall them. If these speculations hold, then we might need to
look for another kind of smart drugs, that helps us generalize and
interlink memories rather than just store them. Perhaps this is one of the
functions of sleep.

Title
       Effects of nicotinic dimethylaminoethyl esters on working memory performance of rats in the
       radial-arm maze.

Abstract
       Nicotine has been found to improve memory performance in a variety of tests, including the
       radial-arm maze. This improvement, together with the consistent finding of a decline in
       cortical nicotinic receptor concentration in Alzheimer's patients, has fueled the search for
       novel nicotinic ligands with therapeutic potential. In the current studies, a series of
       nicotinic compounds was tested for effects on working memory performance in the
       radial-arm maze. One of the three compounds tested, DMAE II (dimethylaminoethanol
       cyclohexyl carboxylate fumurate), produced significant improvements in working memory
       performance. In the first experiment, this drug produced a biphasic dose-response curve
       with improved performance at the 20-mg/kg dose but not at 10 or 40 mg/kg. In a second
       round of DMAE II administration, the same rats showed a significant improvement with the
       40-mg/kg dose. In the second experiment, a new set of rats also showed a biphasic
       dose-response to DMAE II. The 20-mg/kg dose caused a significant improvement whereas
       the 40-mg/kg dose did not. Interactions of DMAE II with nicotine and mecamylamine were
       also studied. Nicotine (0.2 mg/kg) by itself caused a significant improvement in working
       memory performance. No additive effects of DMAE II with nicotine were seen. In fact, some
       attenuation of response was seen with the combination. Choice accuracy data for
       mecamylamine could not be analyzed because of excessive sedation and nonresponding.
       These studies show that, like nicotine, the nicotinic ligand DMAE II causes an improvement
       in radial-arm mace choice accuracy. The lack of additivity with nicotine may have been to
       the partial agonist effects of DMAE II.

Well, hypnotizability and placebo has not much in common.  Hypnotism seems
to be linked with concentration abilities, imagination and allowing
oneself to "let go", although there are large individual variations. The
placebo effect seems to be closely related to the creation of
self-reinforcing positive schematas (gullibility or an open mind helps a
lot) and works best in people who are somewhat depressed, anxious or
otherwise on the "negative side" - they don't help positive people as
much.

  Yes... scarcity economics.  Funny how different Roddenberry's vision
  is from Heinlein's... So different, in fact, that recent eps of Star  
Trek Voyager seem grossly naive about how much they rock the boat when  
they leave their heavenly riches to decent to a planet where their
very   presence is taxing on the other inhabitants.  From post-scarcity
to     scarcity economics, they just don't seem to realize the huge    
difference.

  Indeed, it is sometimes enough that one *can* give free lunches that
  makes it just cause enough to do so.  Socrates spoke of producing good
  instead of repaying evil with evil (as later that Jesus person did as
  well).  It is a greater issue of what you can give/perform/do than
what
  you can take/consume/want.

  Here here!  I've got a new theory burning on my brain...
  I haven't even thought of how to add it to my 'Theories' webpage.
  I refer to it as "Peer Economics."

  Modern Economics are based on stabilizing life through securing
  propriety of resources, and then weighing the production/abundance
  of supply against the desires/scarcity of demand.  Yet I think the
  point at which they fail is the notion of the "Client - Server"
  relationship.  The almighty dollar is the monopolistic Server (or in
  most cases, the served,) and the humans are the clientele.

  What would happen if the paradigm were replaced with the modern
  business model of the network?  What if, like organizational
  flowcharts, we flatten the heirarchy and move to "quality control  
circles in constant communication"?

  We'd likely ditch the paradigm of "Boss - Employee" first thing.
  Instead of the philosophy seen in Plato's day in which the Strong
  Always Rule (not by merit of rulership, but by Might-Making-Right),
  we'd likely see a total change in the job market.  The goals of the
  company/organization whould no longer be the end-all-and-be-all of the
  worker's existance, but rather the company-A would seek work from
  company-B, yet company-B agrees only if it gets its goals achieved
  by company-A.

  Just as a person's resume includes both their skills and their
expected
  salary, other expectations and job perks may become commonly listed.
  The *Interests* of the superhuman organization may become Peers with
  the Interests of the human individual.

  Anyone care to speculate further?

I wrote about a potential Transhumanist Trilogy: THE Power, Omega and the 
Singularity.

Lyle fussed:
<Excuse me, but this is not poetry.  It doesn't scan.  It has no structure. 
 Writing prose in short lines doesn't make it into poetry.>

Eric Watt Forste warned:
<Once upon a time, in the extropians FAQ, I wrote "extropians have no sense 
of humor, none whatsoever". Of course, I intended this as a joke [snip] But 
then again, Lyle doesn't consider himself an extropian, so maybe he really 
does lack a sense of humor.>

However, on another recent thread, Lyle wrote:
<Chris, why don't you go to the L.A. airport, wearing an Extropy t-shirt or 
some kind of Extropian costume (use your imagination), and ask for 
donations?  [snip, and] One afternoon I was approached five different times 
by Christians who wanted me to come to a revival meeting.  The fifth time, 
when the guy asked me if I was a Christian, I said "No, I'm a Satanist," 
and a very interesting conversation ensued.>

Lyle hasn't lost his sense of humor - that's what parody is, twisting 
things out of the context they're normally seen in, just as Lyle recently 
asked David Musick to substitute "corporations" for "highly advanced 
beings" in his The Power of Symbiosis thread to see what it sounded like.

just a playful challenge...

Maybe we should contact Marc somehow and introduce him to the extropians?
This would increase the familiarity and public awareness of the group. He'd
be a valuable asset as well as a superior forward thinker. Also it makes me
wonder if Ross Perot invested in that nano company due to the possibility
for immortality. Many wealthy successful people will do that if the're smart.

Funny, I was just there 2 days ago to pickup someone. We want to make the
extropians look cool and stylish not nerdy so we can apply the memes to the
mainstream masses. They might find costumes or Tshirts hokey. Let me think
for awhile how we could do it in a stylish cool almost 'Wired
Magazine'-like way.

We need a happy medium we need to make the extropians appear 'cool' so
people join in but we need to spread specific memes that don't interfere
with their individual religious beliefs and slowly convert them to our
optimistic philosophy. You can also twist information for any use such as
religious or pollitical to make it sound like you're agreeing with their
ideals such as telling bleeding heart liberals that nano will be the
utility to accomplish their goal of world peace and unlimited wealth. (Even
though there will still be capitalism, we just won't meantion that!)

*** Acceleration utility boosts hard drive performance

A new acceleration utility, introduced by Acceleration Software
International Corp., can boost the hard disk performance by up to 496
percent and reduce application launch times by up to 75 percent.
SuperFassst! is a software-only upgrade to the hard drive. The utility
is comprised of three parts--a hard disk accelerator, an application
accelerator and a multitasking accelerator. The hard disk accelerator
boosts I/O rates up to five times without compression or caching. A
free demonstration copy of SuperFassst! that accelerates the Netscape
web browser can be downloaded from www.accelerationsw.com. For the
full text story, see

IAN: This is true, I recall reading this. If my memory serves me,
I recall reading that ethanol allows the methanol also to vaporize
through the lungs. Also consider that low-does alcohol consumption
is correlated with life-extension, apparently because it reduces the
"stickiness," if you will, of fats in the blood stream, thus prevent-
ing the tendency of arterial lipid accumulation.

I can here it now: the FDA has mandated the addition of ethanol to all
aspartame containing beverages. Nothing by choice, everything by decree.

Let's not, shall we?  It is true that nanotech - or my own vehicle, the
Singularity - would be able to completely fulfill almost any ethical
wish imaginable. BUT. If we go around preaching nano-paradise, we will
be rightly regarded as loons.

In the words of Drexler:

      "I would emphasize that I have been invited to give talks
      at places like the physical sciences colloquium series at
      IBM's main research center, at Xerox PARC, and so forth,
      so these ideas are being taken seriously by serious
      technical people, but it is a mixed reaction. You want that
      reaction to be as positive as possible, so I plead with
      everyone to PLEASE KEEP THE LEVEL OF CULTISHNESS AND
      BULLSHIT DOWN, and even to be rather restrained in
      talking about wild consequences, which are in fact true
      and technically defensible, because they don't sound that
      way. People need to have their thinking grow into
      longer-term consequences gradually; you don't begin
      there." [Emphasis mine.]

And my own reply:

The problem with people expounding their Utopian visions of a nanotech
world is that their consequences *aren't wild enough*. Looking at
stories
of instantly healing wounds, or any material object being instantly
available, doesn't give you the sense of looking into the future. It
gives
you the sense that you're looking into an unimaginative person's
childhood fantasy of omnipotence, and that predisposes you to treat
nanotechnology in the same way. Worse, it attracts other people with
unimaginative fantasies of omnipotence. There's no better way to turn
into a bunch of parlor pinks, sipping coffee and planning the Revolution
without actually doing anything.

Cause I was an engineer/entrepreneur who had some really cool technology
to offer, that people wanted to use for their own projects. I also had
the key inside conduit to the premier supplier of this technology, so I
could make things happen with regard to getting specific niche products
developed. Non-technically skilled entrepreneurs who find they need such
help will often try to find the cheapest source of help, i.e. their
freinds. Add in the various hilarious unlikely stories of my life that I
can tell, and a willingness to tell them, plus someone they could call
to hook up their stereo system just right, or fix their motor yacht or
airplane for a prime rib and Chateau Rothschild rather than $75 an hour,
and you can see what I mean.

Network Trading


In the future, economic transactions won't likely be fundamentally different 
than they are today.  People will almost certainly still have goods and 
services they agree to trade with each other.  However, I believe that the 
average person will be engaging in much more trade than ever before, and I 
believe that the marketplace will be much more fluid and dynamic than it ever 
has been.

As computer networks become more widespread and powerful, it is becoming much 
easier to find  the right people to trade with.  For example, many people are 
selling their products by advertising through the Internet and by exchanging 
money through the computer networks.  When one wishes to purchase a particular 
product, one can ask the computer to perform a search of the Internet to find 
the people who are selling whatever product one is interested in.  Computer 
networks are excellent tools for matching up buyer and seller, and they will 
become more widespread as more people recognize their value and use the 
computer networks routinely.  In the future, if I want to sell some product or 
some service, I will announce that through the computer networks, and the 
people who are interested in what I offer will be directed to me to negotiate 
a trade.  Likewise, if I wish to purchase something, the computer networks 
will direct me to the appropriate list of people.

The widespread use of computer networks will make it much easier to be 
self-employed and contract one's services and talents out to those who offer 
an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less 
necessary to have a "steady job", where one trades with the same person day 
after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have 
several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so they are 
not dependent on any single source of income.

If one is interested in completing a very large and complex project, such as 
building and maintaining hydroponic greenhouses, then one will want to 
organize teams of people to work on this project.  One could first hire a team 
of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one 
could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until 
the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would 
receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the 
appropriate places.  This is not fundamentally any different than what has 
been done for thousands of years now.  People have been organizing companies 
and groups to complete projects for quite a long time.  Now it's becoming a 
lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are helping 
to lower the costs of organizing a business.

I predict that as computer networks become more widespread and their use 
becomes commonplace, a very large percentage of people will be taking 
advantage of this technology to make their economic lives extremely flexible, 
dynamic and lucrative.  I predict that it will become increasingly less common 
for someone to have a "steady job".  That concept seems radical now, because 
there aren't so many secure alternatives for employment than working for the 
same person day after day.  However, I believe this will change within a few 
years, and it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client 
that one is dependent on for income.

I believe that people will become much more "project oriented" than they are 
today.  I think people will look at employment more in terms of working on a 
particular project than they do now.  People will hire other people to 
complete particular projects or tasks, and when the project is done or the 
task is completed, they will each go their own way.  As a project manager, you 
may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them 
regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But 
that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as 
well.  

I believe that in the future, one's financial situation will more accurately 
reflect the quality of work one does and thus be more fair.  Good workers will 
develop a good reputation, and there will be a high-paying demand for them, 
and they will generally only accept the highest-paying offers for their work.  
Those who don't prove themselves to be such good workers will not receive such 
high-paying offers for their work.  Of course, they could always hire someone 
to teach them how to improve their skills and become a more excellent worker, 
and thus improve their financial situation.  

Considering human history, it seems that people's economic lives have become 
increasingly dynamic and are continuing to become even more flexible.  At one 
time, most people were pretty much confined to living in the same village, 
doing the same tasks, all their lives.  As we've progressed and developed 
large cities, it has become much easier for people to relocate and to change 
employers.  Our lives have become much more flexible and filled with more 
options.  I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create 
even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options 
for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work 
for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of 
themselves better and manage their own lives.

Actually, I did not read his suggestion of substitution as a parody,
because I have theorized on, as others have, of the current existence of
transhuman organisms here on earth, operating at such a slow baud rate
that they are not noticed by us. They are commonly referred to as a:
"nation", "corporation", "government", "ethnic group", "profession",
"species", or "ecosystem".

I noticed that same thing, being raised a Catholic and all... I suppose
that transhumanism is a way for me to reconcile my intellectual need for
reason, to the hope for becoming greater than oneself, transcending,
becoming one with the ALL, that has been taught as Catholic Dogma and
demanded as faith in spite of the past 2000 years of showing little
improvement in situation of mans inhumanity to man. That following the
Golden Rule and keeping an open, inquisitive mind one day at a time, one
person at a time will boot strap us all to a better tomorrow.

When I was a little kid, my parents used to tell me about satan and demons
and such and how I had to pray to keep them away. When I was younger my
parents were religious zealots although they've lightened up in their old
age. (ie. When I was born, they had never heard of colic and they were
afraid I'd die so they baptized me at home!! hahaha! And this is in Los
Angeles, CA people!!) I have slight Tourettes (noone even notices it) as
well as my younger brother who has it quite worse than I but a side effect
of this seems to be a highly active imagination so when I had Tourette
panic attacks when I was a kid it was due alot of times to their telling me
of demons and satan and when I finally fought back the religious crap I
realized a greater sense of reality as opposed to the more imaginary
metaphysical religious world I viewed previously and had far fewer panic
attacks. I also think it was due to puberty setting on that my Tourettes
faded but I also think atheism played an integral part. Could it be very
tramatic and damaging for some kids to be exposed to religion?

I was merely saying we should tell people what they 'want' to hear and work
our memes in that way. People won't listen to someone not agreeing with
them so make it sound as if you are agreeing with a bit of a twist. So far
this is all on the drawing board so don't get the impression I'm going to
instantly start walking around talking like an evangelist.

Perhaps cultishness and bullshit is a natural part of any technology being

I'm absolutely sure that the technology will continue with or without them.
They can bullshit all they want but that isn't going to stop the technology
just as the horrible examples the media calls virtual reality won't taint
the image of good virtual reality when it debuts in a decent form for home use.

Not if the evolution of intelligence involves using tools.  There is a 
complete lack of arrowheads, stone axes, and other such artifacts in the 
geological strata dating back to the era of dinosaurs.  

Mark Crosby writes,

Just because something is degradable doesn't mean it will degrade.  
Wood is bio-degradable, but there is plenty of petrified wood.  
Insects are bio-degradable, but entire insects are preserved in amber.  
Leaves are bio-degradable, but there are fossilized leaves.  Even if   
they did use bio-degradable materials, there would be lots of fossils.  
A world-wide civilization would require large-scale structures such as  
mines, harbors, canals, pipelines, and so forth, which would definitely 
leave some trace.  Besides, the concept of "biodegradablity" is an 
advanced concept that they would only arrive at after a long process of 
evolution.  When they first started using tools, they must have just used 
whatever came to hand.  

I think the D. Sapiens scenario requires the intelligent dinosaurs to be 
confined to one small area; perhaps because the rest of the world was 
too hot and swampy for civilized life.  If they lived on an island near 
one of the poles, and if this island is now submerged (or was destroyed 
when the intelligent dinosaurs blew themselves up), then there would 
be no traces.  But this seems highly unlikely to me.  If they reached a 
level where they could transcend, or blow themselves up, then they 
could also colonize the rest of the world.  But apparently they didn't. 

So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on 
earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures.  
Why?  

Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered 
psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, 
and using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and 
started making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been 
stuck in an evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.

No, there will be a whole lot more options to choose from. That will
lead to choosing *the usal one* because the signal to noise ratio wil

It will only work for certain types of products and from retailers that
people know and trust. (would you buy The *Hi-octane* office package
from *Gazoline software* instead of office 2010 from Microsoft?)
We will still be selling goods and services to people. And people buy
from people they know. They buy brands (made by big cooperations
advertising) and they buy something because of word of mouth.

I myself have worked that way, and your theory has some flaws. Those who
makes the most money are usually close conncted to a single company.
Those i know who are not, spend to much time trying to sell their
skills. (And most of them don't like that part of their job. They wish
they could have a sales force.)

You are right that there will no longer be technical reasons why an
individual shouldn't be able to compete with huge corporation. And it
will also happen.

If one person with a high level of skills makes a difference, then many
high skilled workers  cooperating will make more of a difference. At my
current job (a media an marketing company) we are not cheap. Our
costumers know that. They also know that we are a group of talented
individuals with a strong background in as diverse areas as marketing,
video produktion, distribution.... all the things a large corporation
need to sell and comunicate their services and products. Still they use
us because we can do something that an individual cannot. (we have
redundancy in our system for one thing, making us safer.)
Instead of using us they could use individual subcontractors. But for
every two or three subcontractors they would need somebody to keep an
eye out on them. (Most people are note that talented and ned to be
supervised closely not to make bad desicions.) There will then be no net
profitt. just more FUD than if they chosed a *professional* solution.

This would all take a lot of money. A person with a lot of money
wouldn't he hire e secretary to do the boring bits? Already there we are
on the way from the single man comapny.

Large scale projects can still only be done by large groups with a lot
of money.

Probably it will be more in the direction of people working at home for
2-3 days a week. While they are still in a steady job.

But a lot easyer than looking for work all the time.

I agree with a lot of things you are saying, but we must keep in mind
that it is only true in some situations and for some jobs.
Small companies working together on large projects would need to much
coordination and thus be inefficient. We are still humans that need to
work and comunicate with other humans. Thats the most important thing to
remember.

The new way of working probably won't be a revolution but an evolution.
People have worked together for may years now, and only a limited number
of ways seem to be efficient. Of course technology will change
something, but i don't think it will be a very radical departure.

This seems similar to what Ian Banks explores in his Culture novels: the 
Culture is post scarcity and transhumanist in a lazy way; the almost 
complete mutual incomprehension between the do-gooder Culture agents and 
the inhabitants of less fortunate empires form the basis for most of the 
books. 

Just the feeling of audaciousness we tend to feel at the idea that huge
interstellar warships give themselves *humorous* names like "Size Isn't
Everything" (80 km long) or "What Are The Peacetime Applications?"
suggests how much we take scarcity for granted.

I don't doubt that mushrooms and other natural nootropics helped; but, they 
were would have been freely available to other creatures at the time. 
However, I have heard that these mushrooms thrive in cow dung, and humans 
certainly learned how to herd cows so that they might have had a monopoly 
of the best mushroom supplies. Some species of insects, however, herd other 
insects, and also use fungi as foodstuffs, or make honey (and perhaps other 
psychotropic elixirs we are yet unaware of).  Why wouldn't having these 
similar 'self-owned' resources, and the cyberorganization that cultivating 
them brings, have raised their consciousness as well?  Anyway, I suspect 
that any _Great Filter_ would likely be a complex mix of factors, rather 
than having one 'magical' ingredient.  No matter how self-directed a 
creature becomes, it is still part of some larger system of resources and 
restraints, and must adapt to that as well.

This is always the *percieved* catch, and being resourceful is the key.
Speaking only from my on personal experince, I have focused on living 
off art and just art for 8 yrs and hence, havent taken any "day jobs" 
resulting in a lower than usual income. (very worth it IMO)

When I decided to change my economic bracket re: art digital, I
offerred my intense skills at drawing and design in return for intense 
training in computers. After many bogus sidetrips,  I got a good offer.
Today I am being trained and getting paid too. Plus perks.
Also-  you can self teach.

That is rather unfortunate. I fortunately had some rather rational
parents, both technically degreed, who practiced partly from family
tradition, and a need for a solid moral upbringing for their kids. One
thing I would be adamant about defining two different types of religious
behavior: The difference between religious theology or theosophy, and
religious mythology. The former in my opinion tends to have a bit of
extropic potential, while the latter is highly entropic. Seems like
you've been tortured by quite a bit of mythic superstition. I've seen
both types of behaviors by people in the church I was raised in, and the
idiocy of the mythic superstionists made me not wish to continue formal
practicing. Rather, I tend to live a proactive life under the guise of:
" "God" helps those who help themselves". I also, unlike
supertstitionists, have no idea of the location or nature of whatever
caused our universe to come into existence, so rather than atheist, I
tend to be agnostic. I have no convictions either way, and demand proof
of both sides, religious or atheist for their postion. My mother for
example considers herself a Catholic Agnostic, if you can believe it!

IAN: The use of hallucinogenic agents is observed to be
central to almost all primitive "religious" organization.
However much we might like to trash religion,  I don't
think any objective observer could honestly dispute its
central formative role in, and expression of, the evolu-
tion of human intelligence from pre-human conditions.
The same goes for "rock paintings."

How many nonhumans have religions? How many nonhumans
paint coherent images? None that I'm aware of.  As you
concede that hallucinogens may have promoted their aris-
ing, it seems that you must also concede that the hallu-
cinogenic theory of the arising of human intelligence, 
specifically of those feature that mark its arising, 
correlates strongly with the physical evidence.

I both agree and disagree.  In some industries (like software engineering)
it already is easier to work for multiple clients at the same time.  I am
generally working for about three different clients at any given time.  And
this method almost always gives more flexibility and a lot more money than a
static "9-to-5" type job.  *However*, there are a lot of negatives that go
along with this as well.  The stress levels are generally much higher
because you have many more obligations than a "normal" job.  Also, you don't
get that "warm-fuzzy" secure feeling of always knowing what you will be
doing 6 months from now.  Even though I can objectively say that I have no
difficulties getting work (their has been an ongoing computer professional
deficit in Silicon Valley), and have never had a situation where I had to
worry about finding a job, it isn't quite the same as knowing exactly where
you will be working and what you'll be doing in the future.

To be honest, I enjoy the dynamic nature of this situation, but I know a lot
of computer types who have gotten really burnt out in this type of work
environment.  There is still something to be said for a steady job, such as
the ability to spend more time with your family.  TANSTAAFL!

Agreed.  The Internet has been an enormous help in forming project teams.  I
have a not too small list of developers and programmers that I call or email
whenever I have a large project.  More and more software work is being done
this way.  Most of the software people I know do freelance work for various
projects.  I am working on a $1,000,000 project now where the 25-man
development team is made up entirely of freelancers from around the country.
Meetings and discussions take place largely via a mailing list on the
Internet.  There is usually one or two consultants or freelancers who "run"
the whole project.

In fact, if you are strictly interested in making money, this is the way to
go.  Sure, you don't have job security, but the pay is great.  Many
independant developers I know have spouses who work steady jobs.  This way,
they have a guaranteed minimum income and usually medical benefits.  But
when you consider that the average freelance developer makes between
$100-500k per year, this is extremely attractive, especially to the younger
age brackets.

In some industries, "steady job" is already meaningless.  Better get used to
it.  Actually, I think the "many client" type of environment separates the
wheat from the chaff much better, ability-wise, than the "steady job"
environment.  I think the "many client" environment will cause a wider
separation between the living standards of the competent and incompetent in
a given skill category, not at all a bad thing, IMO.

This is exactly the way it currently works in the independant software
development industry.  You can only screw up so many times, and then no one
will hire you.

And incidentally, the majority of independant developers are self-taught.
If you want to increase your skills, you take it upon yourself to learn more
skills.  This is the way it works.  No one else is responsible for your
welfare except *you*.  I learned a majority of the skills I have by studying
a particular subject I wanted to learn, and then finding a short-term
mediocre job that required those skills.  This way I was able to get the
practical experience, but not at the expense of someone who was paying good
money.  I would then go on to take on the good paying jobs after validating
my newly learned skill.  A lot of people learn this way.  (Lesson here: You
get what you pay for!)  You don't have to pay money to learn a valuable new
skill.  Usually it only involves time, some books, and a short-term pay cut.

Flexibility and options are good, but there is a price.  Large scale
networks are a key component of implementing this flexibility, but I think
it has limits to certain professions and industries.  This would not
generally help a grocery clerk get ahead.  Mostly just skilled professionals.

I watched a show once where they suggested that it was the introduction of
seafood into the proto-human diet between 4 and 7 million years ago that
triggered the increase in intelligence.  The diets of most primates are
lacking in several important neuro-active and bio-active compounds directly
involved in higher brain functions.  Many of these compounds are generally
only found abundantly in nature in seafoods.  

Several studies have been done on the impact of diet on intelligence.  The
lack of seafood in a diet (especially from saltwater sources) has been shown
to have direct impacts on the average intelligence of a population.  These
compounds are especially important during childhood.

Iodine is a case in point.  Naturally, iodine is found almost exclusively in
seafood sources.  There is a region in inland China where 1 in 8 people is
technically mentally retarded, and few people in the region have "normal"
intelligence.  As a whole, the average IQ of people in this region is far
below the human average.  The reason has been determined to be iodine
deficiency.  They have no access to sources of iodine in their diet.  They
are genetically normally, but lack of a key compound has rendered them less
intelligent than their genetically determined capability.  Unfortunately,
the effects of this are structural and irreversible.

Fortunately for many developed countries, iodine is artificially introduced
into the diet so that this is not a problem.  This may also be why countries
with high seafood diets also are among the highest in raw IQ as well.

The introduction nootropics into the proto-human diet was very likely
responsible for the advance of our species.  I don't know too much about the
mushroom theory, but the seafood theory does seem plausible.  AFAIK, humans
are the only primates that eat seafood.

And that's where technical consulting/recruiting firms come in.  (And also
where some of the *real*  money is...).  It is becoming common for
independant freelancers to band together to form consulting
companies/groups/associations.  You get more exposure that way.

Good point! ...you may be onto something here.
[I was making a joke  (have you ever tried to talk to someone on acid and
have an intelligent conversation?) But then, I know, I always forget....you
have to put a smiley face or we wont know its not 100% seriousity...]

I don't know if prehistoric man ate acid, I dont really care ; - )

But in essence (with or without mushrooms) you are talking about something
quite important, more specifically *patterns and visualizations* and a keen
observation about the intelligence of humans - being that (primarily) through
the vision part of the brain, we have developed pattern recognitions that
other species do not. 
How this will shape up in the debate about and developement of cognitive
science and intelligence research  I am not qualified to say. 
But it is certain that our eyes and mind and imagination (mind's eye) all
work together in a very different and cohesive way to make us what one would
call "sentient".

What about the fisher monkeys of the east pacific? They eat some sort of

In my 1980 sf novel THE DREAMING DRAGONS, Saurus sapiens lived on pre-freeze
Antarctica and didn't roam beyond its shores because they evolved Vingean
Tine-like group minds, connected via radio so that you got stupid fast if
you roamed too far from the pack.  Individual brains were, so to speak,
terminals.  A kind of trace immortality was built in to their distributed
consciousness.

Just wanted to invite you all to check out my brand spankin' new site:

http://www.tpk.net/~retroman/

it has stuff on my drive system, what I plan on doing with it, and all
sorts of stuff you never wanted to know about me....

Also, if any of you have good links you think I should have, email me
with them. I know there are still some bugs, they will be fixed after
turkey day.

Your animation of the balls rolling in the circle sort of reminded me of
perpetual motion machines. Please don't tell me the Lorrey Drive is a form
of perpetual motion!! Perpetual motion doesn't exist and we all understand
that. Also anyone with technical knowledge attempt to put the Lorrey drive
through rigorous testing to see if it would work in theory as well as the
real world and Mike, tell us when you've got the prototype working!

But once we have it there's no taking it away. And do you actually think a
UN ban will stop all the countries from doing secret research.  Once a
country makes the first nanite it will only be a matter of time before the
tech itself drifts down to the populous after a small nanowar possibly?
Everyone gets the idea that there will be an all purpose nanite when the
reality of things are that nano will likely be highly specialized because
you will need certain tools for certain tasks. Sure you can build one that
can build others but you need to design each specific type of nanite by
hand. I believe we'll have nano before we'll have AI. AI will come shortly
after nano because we'll be able to quickly create the processing power
needed for AI.

All -

Today is Thanksgiving here in the US, and I thought I'd share a poem =
which popped into my head last night.  It's my first "published" =
work, so please be gentle and enjoy.

JBL

Give thanks every day
for the knowledge that, come what may,
you=B9ll have at least one more chance
to take a few steps in life=B9s
intricate dance.

Give thanks as you watch the sun rise,
and rub the sleep out of your eyes.
Today is a chance to get your bearing,
and do some reflection on how your life
is faring.

Give thanks for just being alive;
sow your seeds and watch them thrive.
Today is a chance to assess your goals,
and summon the will to pay
the tolls.

Give thanks for your head, your heart, and your muscle;
use them to advance through life=B9s hussle.
Today is a chance to strengthen them all,
and hone the skills needed
to heed your life=B9s call.

Give thanks for your friends along the way,
who=B9ve given support and known just what to say.
Today is a chance to return the favor,
and enhance understanding
for both sides to savor.

Give thanks for all this, and for all that you are;
tomorrow you=B9ll look back from afar.
But today is a chance to do so much more,
than all the other
days before.

As I said on the page and preeviously, it has nothing whatsoever to do
with so called "prepetual motion" "zero point energy" or any of that
other crap.

1)  If the research is done in secret, this substantially increases the
probability of a gray-goo or nano-dictatorship world.
2)  Every hour the research is delayed, another six thousand people
die.  Most of these deaths, unlike all those prior to the twentieth
century, are not merely *premature* but *unnecessary*.
3)  Do you have any idea how many people would die in nanowar?
4)  Do you really want a nanowar?
5)  Do you want billions of innocents to die because you were careless?
6)  I thought not.
7)  So just be careful, okay?

I think it depeds a bit on why the retina died; if the ganglion cells die,
then you loose the optic nerve (their cell bodies are in the eye), but if the
damage is local to the other kinds of cells (retinosis pigmentosa?), then you
will have a working (if understimulated) optic nerve.

Well, you have to do it the other way around, make axons grow from the 
retina to the brain. Or perhaps slowly drag a thalamic neuron towards the 
eye, stimulating it to grow and axon back to the lateral geniculate 
nucleus. But it seems like too much trouble; just replace the nerve with 
an artificial system.

Okay, I've taken a look at the Lorrey drive, and I've found what appears
to be a gaping mechanical flaw.

Take a mass M, weighing one gram.  M goes around in the centrifuge
shown.  At D, M travels at 5 meters/second, at B, 10 meters/second.  At
A, M is pushed forward by an extra 5 m/s and at C, M is slowed by 5 m/s.

The total system, including the centrifuge, works like this.  Start at A
before M is accelerated, assuming the whole device to have zero
momentum.  At A, M is pushed forward by 5 m/s.  This transfers
-5gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M goes around the centrifuge
through B, coming out at C going -10 m/s instead of 10, transferring 20
gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M is then slowed down at C,
transferring another -5gm/s to the centrifuge.  M then goes from C to A
through D, going from -5m/s to 5m/s, transferring -10gm/s of momentum to
the centrifuge.

Trust me, I know how you feel - I, too, had a cherished Great Idea, but
luckily found the flaw *before* it was published.

The description of the drive sounds wrong to me, although I appreciate 
there may be more to it.
Given what you say, there *would* be excess "centrifugal force" pushing 
towards the side of the highest velocity. But the force doing the 
accelerating of the masses would cause a reaction equal to this, and 
would in the opposite direction. Having a rotating frame of reference 
only makes the maths harder.

I'd like to be wrong but I've seen Laithwaite, Hayasaka (sp?)  and at 
least one other make similar devices, all of which failed when tested 
away from their original rigs. Measured forces proved to be due to 
friction, erratic vibration and in one case, the exhaust from the model 
aeroplane engine powering the prototype. :-)

I know you won't have made that basic a mistake, but you're up against a 
*very* hard problem here, at the very least.

Defend it Mike. Don't let one opinion get you down. Perhaps there is

If they don't utilize the current cryonics, it's not my problem, it's their
fault. Besides most of those people don't want to live longer than their
normal lifespans anyways due to religious beliefs.

>3)  Do you have any idea how many people would die in nanowar?

Depends. If the secret gets out like the atomic bomb did then many people
would suddenly have nano as well as nano protection so it would equalize
the effect. Perhaps then only 3rd worlds would be fighting with nano while
the more responsible larger countries would use it as often as they use the
atomic bomb which is fairly rare.

Nope

They've likely already got people working on it and we just have to get to
it first. But I highly doubt a UN ban on all nano research would take place.

[[Michael Lorrey posts:]]

Every day I still wonder that
no one has developed this before, 

[[I came up with something very much like the Lorrey Drive when I was
about nine years old. I found out several years later, much to my 
chagrin, that
a) Lots of other people have had the same idea, and
b) it does not work.]]

it is such a simple concept, but I guess
that most people still interpret Newtonian Mechanics according to 
classical
human perceptions. The idea that reaction mass can have its momentum 
drawn
out of it and then recycling it is so contrary ...,
that it just seems to violate some natural law or something. 

[[Yes, this is the problem.
The two laws in question are:
a) Conservation of Linear Momentum
b) Conservation of Angular Momentum

Outside of transitory, self-canceling  quantum effects, there
 is zero (0) experimental evidence of a violation of either of 
these Laws, which is why they are called such.
They are therefore used in the design of everything from Autogyros
to Z-0 detectors, with fantastic success.]]

What I have developed has been
attempted by others, although theirs were half baked designs, because 
they
really did not understand the mechanism fully. The Lorrey drive is a 
device
which converts angular momentum (torque) to linear acceleration 
(thrust)
without any mechanical linkage to a linear reaction mass.

[[The type of mechanism is irrelevant. It is the net result that 
matters,
and there is no experimental evidence for the above result .]]

. While this is not so important on
the ground or in the air or water, where there is always more reaction
mass available, in space you must carry your reaction mass with 
yourself
in order to be able to maneuver and navigate the vast reaches. 

[[Not necessarily- laser/maser sails, accelerators, tethers and other 
momentum 
transfer techniques are serious contenders.]]

 ...However, if you were able to speed each
mass up at one point in the orbit, and slow it down again on the 
opposite
side of the centrifuge, you would have a point in the centrifuge where
all masses were going slowly on that side, and fast on the opposite 
side.
This would produce excess centrifugal force in a direction straight out
from the point of highest velocity.... 
Over here on the right side, where the masses move fastest, is where 
the excess
centrifugal force is generated. This translates into linear thrust..

[[Which is precisely canceled by the forces on the mechanism that
accelerates the masses.

IAN: Perhaps you know they did but are only joking. ?? 
Assuming you do not know: in fact Mexican tribes, such 
as the Mazatecs, consumed, as a central feature of reli-
gious ritual and healing ceremony, the seeds of two varieties 
of the morning glory, ipomoea violacea and rivea corymobosa, 
from which Dr. Albert Hoffman extracted LSD. But before you 
go out and wolf down a packet of morning glory seeds  %^)  
consider that most are coated with a toxic fungicide. 
Also, I suspect they don't sell the active varieties. |^(

LSD was originally extracted by Dr. Hoffman from the 
rye fungus ergot (claviceps purpurea) from which several 
popular medications are derived, such as the life exten-
sion drug Hydergine. Here too, in the case of rye fungus, 
there is evidence of ceremonial religious use when prop-
erly prepared, as the fungi is quite poisonous.

Hawaiian wood rose also contains LSD, as I understand,
in fairly high concentrations. It's even sold through
mail order companies. I'm, however, not aware of it
being associated with historical ritual use.

IAN: It's interesting to note that the anti-drug mind-set, 
which acts to suppress the logical integration of hallucinogenic
knowledge and practice into modern life and anthropo-neurological
investigation, cannot see the connections that make this line of 
inquiry logical.  In short, the lower intellectual capacity of 
this violent subset of society suppresses the application of 
those agents that may be associated with the growth of intellect-
ual capacity, which is exactly what one would predict. The drug 
laws represent the victory of ignorance which stifles further 
intellectual progress and evolution along these lines.

Good idea!  Marc Andreessen sounds like someone likely to be an Extropian.

Nobody knows about cryonics, and I frankly don't trust it to preserve my
soul, being a Penrosian noncomputationalist.  I sincerely doubt that the
average human would turn down immortality.

My ethical system says that as a student of the Singularity, I have to
accept responsibility for piloting humanity safely home, and that's all
of humanity.  If you want to be irresponsible, that's your decision. 
Mine is that every unnecessary death is my personal fault for not
thinking fast enough.

I have to agree with you on this one, Eliezer.  I've seen this idea
(imbalanced centrifugal drive) before.   In the book "How To Build A
Flying Saucer" (T.B. Pawlicki, 1981), the author describes a couple
of variations on this theme, each with a different mechanical
implementation.  Both of them produce a motion similar to what is
shown in the animation on the Lorrey Drive web page.  Neither of
them work.  The Lorrey Drive may be different in implementation, but
it is still the same in principle and carries with it the same fatal
flaw as Pawlicki's variants.  Devices of this kind cannot work.

A group of transhuman technology advocates hight the Extropians, to
whose mailing list I am subscribed, read an interview with you (in
Fortune magazine) in which you spoke highly of nanotechnology.  This
touched off a minor debate in which numerous individuals spoke of
introducing you to our happy group, but nobody contacted you because the
concept of actually DOING something is apparently foreign to these
people.  I am therefore taking matters into my own hands.

Judging by your quotes in the nanotechnology article, you are familiar
with the materialist Utopia aspect of nanotechnology, but not with the
far more powerful intelligence enhancement technologies that lead to the
Singularity.

---Quick Intro To The Singularity---

1) Computers double in power every eighteen months.
2) Computers double in power every eighteen *subjective* months.
3) Three years after computers match human researchers, computing power
goes to infinity.

4) The human brain is thought to require 10^17 operations/second.
5) Current computing power is 10^12 ops/second.
6) The Singularity will occur in approximately 2025.

---End of Quick Intro---

Since you're interested in the far future, I just thought you should
know that human history ends in less than thirty years.  The scenes
depicted in "The Diamond Age" are really quite unlikely.  Before
nanotechnology was that familiar, the era of merely human intelligences
would be long gone.

One Web page - say, you actually invented those things, didn't you? - in
which you might be interested is "Staring Into The Singularity" at:
http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html

This expands the arguments given above, which are actually totally
implausible.  Too optimistic because a dish of bacteria doesn't outweigh
the world in 4 days, and too pessimistic because bacteria can't think.

The page also provides answers to some "very philosophical questions".

> "There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason
> decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be
> able to design exactly the body you want." 
> 
> "Well," I say, "there's no reason I should be unhappy." 
> 
> "That raises a very philosophical question," he says. He seems exhausted, or
> perhaps disappointed by my skepticism. He slows down for a second.  "Well,

[As you might put it:]
"Well, then, we could redesign our minds too.  There's no reason why we
should feel pain.  There's no reason why our short-term memories should
only hold seven items.  There's no reason why we shouldn't think
millions of times faster.  You could speed up your neurons, put in some
new ones, and rearrange them any way you wanted to.  If you wanted to
feel happy, you could do that."

My page supplies a categorical answer to "Why?", as well as "What?",
"How?" and "When?".  Probably not correct answers, as I take pains to
point out, but answers that at least show any lesser answers to be
wrong.

Up and Out,
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

He just proved that my system didn't violate conservation of momentum.
He did not show that there was not thrust produced, because he used the
wrong equation. The sticking point is the mechanism for putting energy
into the sytem that will not act as an opposite reaction to the
centrifugal force extracted as thrust. I have it, and thats my
secret....

I know Pawlicki. I also know that he had a live demonstration on
Canadian Public Radio of his demonstrator. It did work, though it was so
imbalanced and poorly designed that it self destructed once it finished
a few trips across the room. What I put on the page was a very _basic_
example. What I am using for my own demonstrator is much more
sophisticated. It will not produce torque on the whole system, it will
produce a thrust curve that is flat, rather than sine waved as Pawlickis
did. He never understood the whole concept, and was never able to take
it beyond his simple design. 

I was expecting this sort of response from many.

Ah!  The persecution complex begins!  If you were expecting this, why

For the love of Pete, why can't you just bloody well say so on your Web
page, instead of sending us off on a wild goose chase?  Just note on
your Web page:
"The key to this mechanism is the method of accelerating and slowing the
circling balls.  If this was done by normal means, the total thrust
would cancel out.  I refuse to tell you how it works."

Look, Mike, if you can impart forwards momentum to the balls without
disturbing the rest of the system, what the hell's the cylinder for? 
Take the damn thing out and apply force to the balls directly, then let
them bounce off a trampoline without this elaborate cylinder thing. 
What is all this?  Camouflage?  If you want to keep your drive a secret,
SAY so, don't put up elaborate misleading Web pages designed to make
every physicist within three light years call you a crackpot.  Just
say:  "No, I won't tell you how it works."  Mike, somewhere in your
system there's got to be a module where you impart forwards momentum to
something without imparting an equal and opposite backwards momentum. 
If you've got it, the Lorrey Drive is a success, if not, a failure.  As
far as I can tell, your page does not describe such a module.  At best
it describes an unnecessarily complex way of using the momentum produced
by another module and falsely implies that this is relevant.

No offense, here, but I've read a work on cranks and you're beginning to
show some symptoms.  You publish a device, I say the device has a flaw,
you claim I used the wrong equation, and then when half the mailing list
chimes in you claim that what you published is totally irrelevant and
the secret lies elsewhere.  This is NOT proper scientific procedure EVEN
if you know what you're doing.

I had the opportunity to become a mathematical crank, once.  I thought
I'd disproved Cantor's Diagonal Theorem by pointing out that the finite
numbers could be placed into one-to-one correspondence with all subsets
of the powers of two, and thought that the Theorem stated it was not
possible.  Then on one fateful day I actually applied the Theorem and
realized I hadn't taken the possibility of infinite subsets into
account, just the finite ones.

At this point I realized I had two choices.  One, I could decide that
Cantor's Diagonal Theorem wasn't true *anyway*, spend the rest of my
life saying so, plague math professors with poorly typed equations, and
become a general mathematical crank.  Two, I could admit I made a
mistake and get on with my life.  Guess which one I chose?

Of course, I was, in fact, wrong.  This has been known to happen to me. 
Perhaps it has happened to you.  Perhaps it has not.  Certainly I would
not want the billionaire inventor of the famous Lorrey Drive to hold a
personal grudge against me.  On the other hand, I don't want to see a
fellow human turn into a crackpot when I could have saved him.

In accordance with the scientific method, I hereby propose that this
debate be suspended until such time as Lorrey produces experimental
evidence or six months have elapsed, whichever comes first.  If at this
time Lorrey is the possessor of a Nobel Prize or three, I shall
apologize handsomely.  On the other hand, if Lorrey Inc. *fails* to
drive Boeing out of business, Michael Lorrey shall admit he was wrong
and get on with his life.

Is it a deal?

You must obviously be hiding something unless you were putting out the
Lorrey Drive into the public domain for free and which I doubt due to your
want to make a fortune on it's design. Then again perhaps I'm in denial? I
don't want this turning into faith.

They would turn it down initially but demand it on their deathbed.

There is something called the free market which is every man is out for
themselves. You're making it sound like a religion? You meantioned a soul
and that you are a student of the singularity as if it were a superior
being. Lets not get religious about the singularity. Please! You may
consider me heartless and cruel but thats life for yah! The free market is
heartless and cruel and nothing can stop that so live with it. You sound
like a bleeding heart liberal attempting to ease all pain and suffering on
the planet. Come on, try to save the planet.

I hear that they do sell the varieties containing LSD but they are treated
with a toxic fungicide so you would need to grow a generation of morning
glories to get fresh seeds which isn't hard. But I also hear that the side
effects are worse than the 'high'. I hear that you can get VERY sick from
them and that you need to mash the seeds into a pulp. I myself have never
tried acid but I know alot about herbs and plants. When I was 5 I tookover
the backyard and grew all sorts of plants but now I only grow Insectivorous
plants (ie. flytraps, sundews, butterworts, etc) and I'm dying to get my
hands on some nepenthes!

I am me.  With that position comes certain responsibilities.  I am a
student of the Singularity - not learning *from*, learning about.  I'd
say I was dissecting the Singularity under the microscope, if I thought
it was possible.  Reverence is evil because then you never know the
truth, and I've got to know the truth.

Indeed.  My "expected" response would have been entirely different 
had Mr. Lorrey not presented his idea such that it has all appearance 
of being just another variant of the Dean Drive, which has all the 
credibility of a perpetual motion machine.

To Michael Lorrey:

If you don't want to make yourself look like a crackpot, but are
unwilling to reveal a critical detail without which your idea
appears as pure quackery, then you should refain from revealing
anything about it until you have the proper legal protection (i.e.
patents) and are ready to disclose enough information to show how it 
might get around it's apparent fatal flaws.  I suggest that you read 
your own description of it while attempting to maintain the point of 
view of someone who does not know the critical secret ingredient.  
Would you not find the concept highly suspicious from that 
perspective?

I was thinking exactly the same thing.  Only the motion component
along one of two dimensions has any effect in that system.  The other
component need not exist at all.  Heck, if you can impart momentum
to a ball without disturbing the rest of the system, why not apply
that technique to the vehicle itself and forget about the balls?  I
think it's fairly clear that the Dean Drive (centrifugal) aspect of
the mechanism is not, in itself, the solution to the reaction mass
problem, since making a Dean Drive work still requires that the
reaction mass problem be solved by some other means.  So why is the
centrifugal arrangement there at all?  Just a smoke screen?

Such a mechanism can easily give the illusion of working when it is 
applied to a vehicle that has even a little static friction.  The 
more intense and shorter duration "pulse" of force as the weight goes 
through the fast part of it's path can overcome static friction 
(aka "stiction") better than the longer duration slow part of the 
cycle.  I'd bet that oiling the wheels of Pawlicki's machine, or 
placing it on an air track, would greatly worsen it's performance, 
thus disolving the illusion.  IMHO, Pawlicki is either suffering from 
a serious case of self delusion, or is a deliberate quack.  I don't 
want to get into speculating about which of these is the case.

> HAHAHAHAHA, Oh yeah. This is optimistic!

I'm not sure quite what you meant by that, but really, the whole thread
was the last straw.  Can't you guys just walk out and do something?  Are
you going to be struck by lightning if you look up his email and send
him some?  For crying out loud, what's the worst that can happen?  He's
not going to send out hit squads.  I have to deal with this kind of
insecurity and inaction in myself and I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH
IT IN ANYONE ELSE.  You guys have mental energy to burn and you're
sitting around doing less than I am.

Can't I even get a rise out of you people?  Do you think you're going to
get to the Singularity by sitting around and doing nothing?  Someday I
may want minions or advice or even constructive criticism, and I'm not
getting it.  I've gotten more constructive criticism from my
technophobic grandparents.

You're Extropians.  Say something new!  I haven't heard anything new on
this list that wasn't quoted from an article.  Where's the new ideas?  I
live off of new ideas.  New ideas are all that's important because it is
new ideas that cause technological progress.  My bookmarks are chosen
for information density and information density is measured in new
ideas.  What's the censored point of flipping through all this flipping
email if I'm not going to come out knowing more than I came in?

There is a time for for talking, a time for planning, and a time to just
go out and do something.  The time for talking was over when the first
computer was switched on.  The time for talking was over when it became
possible to find out the Meaning of Life by building superintelligences
instead of philosophizing.  Now is the time for serious, practical
plans, and occasionally the time for action.  Soon the edge of the
Singularity will be in full bloom, perhaps before the next summer.  By
that time you'd damn well better have all our plans in place because the
instant it becomes possible, I am going to go out and do something!

You think Marc Andreessen would be a valuable recruit?  Send him email. 
Send him a letter.  Plan it, design it, or just go out and DO it.  Don't
talk about it.  ONE POST saying that he'd be a valuable recruit is ALL
that's necessary in the way of talk.  After that, start discussing
practical aspects of the letter ("Should we stress the Singularity, the
Extropian culture, or that philosophical question he couldn't answer?"),
or else just send the damn thing.

> The question is how do we get to him? Anyone know ANY POSSIBLE way of
> contacting him? Does anyone have his email and does he actually read it?

A practical question!  Unfortunately, it's fairly clear that nobody
tried to look him up via Alta Vista.  "Does he actually read it?"  No,
maybe a secretary does.  But I'm sure someone reads  it.  If that
doesn't work we can corner him at a convention.

DO SOMETHING!
DO SOMETHING!
DO SOMETHING!

I think it was Dennis Miller who said something about that popular prayer

"Now I lay me down to sleep
blah, blah, blah
If I die before I wake"

IF I DIE BEFORE I WAKE?!

Actually, it hasn't been quiet at all. Since about October 1995, string
theorists seem to be agreed that all five forms of string theory (bosonic, 
Types I, IIa, IIb, heterotic) are different limits of one underlying
theory, "M-theory", which is a theory of interacting _membranes_
(fundamental objects of two or more dimensions) in eleven-dimensional
spacetime. 

John Baez wrote a bit about it at

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week72.html

Some preprints:

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9609051
"String Theory Dualities", Michael Dine

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9608117
"M-Theory: the theory formerly known as strings", Michael Duff

http://xxx.lanl.gov/hep-th/abs/9607067
"The Second Superstring Revolution", John Schwarz

As for connection to experiment, a lot of papers on string phenomenology
are being written, but the theory doesn't yet have a major predictive
success which it can claim as uniquely its own.

What symptoms? Countering the first glance arguments of someone I never
met makes me a crank? Now you're just ticked off that I'm not going to
tell you all my secrets for free. I'll take the damn simulation off
there if that makes you happy. It's obvious it did not do its job of
helping you understand. It's also quite obvious that you did not
actually READ the page.

Many vegans are raising little vegan retards. Irreversible, of course. 
Here Darwin is truly generous, granting the stupid even more stupidity.

Apropos diet, some Indian practice(d) coprophagia (in dehydrated form ;), 
to make symbiont-synthesized cobalamine (lack of which causes pernicious 
anaemia) from intestine flora better bioavailable. The attempt of yogis 
to recycle melatonine (already discussed on this list) is noteworthy as 
well.

Well, live and learn.

Apropos melatonine, if you are <50 Yrs, don't take it as bolus, use 
sustained release form, which doesn't give a stratospheric, but short 
serum spike. The receptor concentration is being homeostased, resulting in 
adaptation. This might result in a "Dorian Grey" effect, if the dose is 
lowered. In one anecdotal case, it resulted in doubling of the therapeutic 
dosage after 4 years, I think somebody on this list/CryoNet said he 
experienced similiar symptoms.

Most of Bavaria, Southern Krautland, has been leached almost free of 
iodate in the last glacial. Hence, the population, especially the mountain 
village inhabitants suffer(ed) from iodine deficiency, which results in 
slight mental retardation (which was further aggravated by inbreeding, 
especially in mountain valleys) and hypertrophy of the thyroidal 
("Kropf"). Interestingly, part of local folklore groups' garb is a kind 
of necklace (hung with small silver coins) designed to conceal/ornate the 
hypertrophy. (I forgot the name of the piece, but it has "kropf" in it).

Though iodate/fluorine fortified salt is being sold on the market, sea 
fish iodine is considered to be most bioavailable. Eating sea fish one 
time a week will also further supply such essential microelements, as 
(methyl)mercury, cadmium, and plutonium (if you happen to to live near
the scenic Windscale), PCP, and pesticide metabolites, which like binding 
to your hormone receptors, which makes your homeobox somewhat puzzled in 
utero. (Boys will be girls, and all that).

Another reason to keep your iodine depot well stocked (and held a couple 
of iodate tablets in the cupboard) is the radioiod from reactor cores, 
seriously gone China. Those children in the Ukraine (which happens to be 
virtually depleted from iodine as well) got their (activated) iodine 
supplements as airborne particles. Ever seen firefly kids, glowing in the 
dark?

Siberian (and probably Scandinavian) Amanita muscaria is psychactive 
(but the effects are somewhat drastic, so take care), and was used by 
Tungus shamans in their rituals. Yogi's recycling trick was practiced 
here, too, as muscarine & Co are virtually nonbiodegradable.

Humans will eat about anything, especially in a pinch.

Put up my website, it's:

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/6810/

or

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/6810/outlook.htm

If you don't want to put it up I won't take it personally but some of the
stuff _is_ good.

Actually I was in the process of it although I was composing the email so
that it sounded highly professional and as non-scifi as possible.

Where are you getting this information from? What gives you the impression
that everyone on this list sits on their thumb and reads email without
doing anything? I'm still considering the trekkie booth.

Many of the people on this list are critics leaning heavily on cynics which
is _very bad_. Perhaps its due to attracting people to the mailinglist
where the internet is the land of cheapskates where noone wants to pay for
anything. We must prevent ourselves from the entropy of internet couch
potatoism. I'm even considering bikeing 
down to Marina Del Rey to go to the extropian dinner meeting because I
don't currently have decent transportation. I'm hoping my schoolwork won't
get in the way. Can I get a carpool from anyone further south than I?

Uhhh, I give new ideas. Just take a look at the archives. I seem to create
many of the  new threads.

Damn! I like this guy! Practical, Positive, with a driving force behind
him. Perhaps I could contact you over the phone! Send me private email.

If we don't go out and do something we'll discuss it forever and it will
eventually entropize into a big semantical discussion which we all agree is
pointless.

If I may speak for the group as a whole: Take action NOW! Do WHATEVER YOU

Good question.  This is Terence's theory, not mine.  I just mentioned it 
because it might be of interest.  I can't find the book in which Terence 
presented this idea;  if I do find it, I will quote his argument at length.

So are you saying that we need religion or some form of it? Perhaps we
should speed up the evolution of the christian meme to conform to our values.

Thats a cool concept. But maybe we should talk about it a little more

But don't you see that Drexlerian nanotech (if indeed feasible) means a 
new energetic minimum for the area currently occupied by the squishy ecosphere? 
Do you think the Blue Goo will be able to contain the explosive breeding of 
Gray Goo?

Nope, camerado. What one might achieve (though I doubt it) is a tiny 
movable "eye of the tornado" with the soft human in the midst, protected 
by a bristling perimeter nanoguard. The entire biosphere will be slime. 
These humans, which were unprotected, and these where a breach of the ice 
occured would be slime. Virtually everything would be slime.

(After a while, evolution would start anew, beginning from this new 
energy minimum. It might achieve sapience, time given. But it won't 
feature any squishies).

Actually, depending on the layout of the device, while it does produce a
sine wave of thrust in the x axis(referencing my infamous animation) for
each mass in the system, it is not symmetrical in shape. Overlaying the 
sine waves of several masses and summing them up shows a definite
production of thrust.

I've attached a jpg of one of these thrust charts from the simulator.
The line in the negative x area is the sum of the four driver sine
waves. The little peaks are due to Excels problems in dealing with
radian calculations.

I'm sorry that i don't have the simulator available right now. I'm
trying to shrink it down a bit (a 4 meg excel wb was what it started
as)so it'll run easy on a web page. THis chart was the output from an
earlier version.

Hmmm...  heheh!
Yes, but only if you buy the trendy new 
pop-determinist song:

"....humans are only engines of our  DNA..."
(someone BESIDES an artist must have written it)

I think most everyone is agnostic, even tho many won't admit it.  Most agree
that they don't KNOW -- absolutely for sure -- that there is a god; they
agree in the impossiblility of knowledge of the existance of god.  (However,
a theist extropian might argue that some things that seem impossible now
might be overcome and one day we transhumans might be able to prove or
disprove the existance of god.)  But as George Smith argues (*Atheism: The
Case Against God* and *Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies*) agnosticism
is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned
with a different aspect of religious belief.  Theism and atheism refer to
the presence or absence of BELIEF in a god; agnosticism refers to the
IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWLEDGE regarding a god or supernatural being.

An agnostic, therefore, is one who maintains that there might be some
supernatural being that is closed to human knowledge.  Religious "belief" is
based on whatever it is you believe -- and usually "faith."  One can't say:
well I WANT to believe, so I will.  Nor can one say: I don't WANT to
believe, so I won't.  You either believe or you don't believe.  (Of course
you can always change your mind.)  };-}

According to Smith, theism and atheism exhaust all possible alternatives
with regard to the belief in a god; one is either a theist or an atheist;
there is no other choice.  (I guess he considers a deist a type of theist.)
One either believes god exists or one does not.

According to Smith, and I tend to agree, agnosticism is a legitimate
philosophical position, but it is not a third alternative or halfway house
between theism and atheism.  Instead, it is a variation of either theism or
atheism.  The self-proclaimed agnostic must still designate whether he does
or does not believe in a god -- and, in doing so, he commits himself to
theism or he commits himself to atheism.  BUT HE DOES COMMIT HIMSELF.
Agnosticism is not the escape clause that it is commonly thought to be.

The issue of BELIEF still must be addressed regardless of one's agnosticism.
I consider myself an agnostic, of course, regarding many things, but on the
issue of god, I'm an atheist because I simply don't believe.

Of course, then there's Omega . . .

Anyone who is familiar with George Smith's writing might also be familiar
with his response to Pascal's Wager: Smith's Wager.  I can't quite remember
how it goes.  Anyone know?

I'm not sure, but I think if you ever want to remove yourself from this
mailing list,
you must send mail to "extropians-request@extropy.org" with the following
command in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe extropians-digest [your email ID]


I don't think you can be removed from the list by asking us, the recipients
of the Extropian mailing list, to remove you, i.e. don't try to unsubscribe
by sending mail to the list at:

    extropians@extropy.org

However . . .

 1) Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:

It's possible that some Extropian ideas may appear in a Time magazine story
on religions and the Internet in a couple of weeks. I spoke to a reporter on
the subject on Monday. He started (to my relief!) by saying that he
understood that Extropianism is not a religion, but is a philosophical
movement. He's interested in our take on the effects of the Internet on
religious and philosophical belief.

If we're lucky, not only we will make it into the story, but perhaps the Web
site URL will appear.

Onward! Upward! Everywhere!

IMHO, most atheists are convinced that "god" is an impossiblity, and it is
not subject to their "faith or
belief" but usually to evidence (or lack of, explicitly).

Also, IMHO, all agnostics do *not* believe in "some supernatural being",
 rather they allow that there may 
be some kind of guiding universal power (often forces of nature, unknown
physics, some kind of unyet discovered
scientific or macro-cosmic (nonanthropomorphic) laws.

The thing you talk about is what I heard the Secular
Humanists refer to as an _Uncertain Deists_.

(Believes there probably is some kind of god, but not
sure what it is.)

Disagree.
I don't maintain that there is or is not a god. I don't definitely 
believe in god.
I don't definitely disbelieve in god. Neither do I believe that it is 
unknowable whether there is a
god or not. Just that I don't know, or know how to know. I could invoke 
Kosko and say
that I both believe and disbelieve.
I *definitely* don't believe in forcing black/white divisions on 
something that is as fuzzy as human belief. :-)

Hey, I take what Lyle is saying about the kinds of cyberorganisms you 
mention very seriously too!
I think we need to consider these existing 'spontaneous orders' whenever we 
rev up our dynamic optimism and contemplate boundless expansion through 
self transformation.

A while back, people on the list proposed changing the definition of SO in 
BEST DO IT SO to self-ownership.  I recall that some people had complained 
that 'Spontaneous Orders' weren't always extropian.  Of course, no one ever 
said they were; but, they are there, and they are 'bigger' than us and 
can't be ignored.  I hope the new Extropian principle of Self-Ownership 
will explicitly address some of these exo-self issues that were sort of 
murkily folded into the old Spontaneous Order principle.

True, Lyle's suggestions are not parodies (Lyle prefers riddles ;)  The 
effect is similar though - things are seen out of their usual context and 
insights are sometimes obtained.

I *REALLY* *REALLY* *REALLY* hope that they understand Extropianism isn't a
religion because reporters often say one thing and do another. Lets all
pray this doesn't happen! :)

WHich in my opinion is just as much of a dogma without support as faith
in a theism.

If anything, this is probably where I wind up. You might also call us
_Faithless Deists_.  The requirement to have "faith" is IMHO anathema to
anyone who considers themselves to have a scientific mind. Whether this
faith is in the existence or nonexistence of a U-Prime, it does not
matter, as nothing can be proven, NOW. Others like John Clark would say
that to a scientist, if it can't be proven NOW then it doesn't exist,
which is wrong. There is much in our observable universe which we have
no idea how it works, and there are plenty of loopholes in scientific
theories that describe phenomena which we have no way of proving or
observing NOW. Tomorrow we may be able to, and that is called progress,
which is the scientists "holy" mission to bring about. A scientist
cannot do so if he or she has a closed mind.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

        First off, I'd like to say that I agree with Eliezer and Chris Hind
on most facets of their respective posts.  Right now, I am doing all I can
to spread the memes of extropy and transhumanism.  I disagree with Eliezer's
comment that "I haven't heard anything new on this list that wasn't quoted
from an article."  That is untrue.  Michael Lorrey has had some great ideas
manifested with 'Lorrey Drive'.  Every poem or piece of written artwork that
goes onto this list has the *potential* to go farther.  Many of the poems I
write get published in various places.  I have a music concert centered on
my extropian-esque music and lyrics coming up this weekend.  I am
kineticizing (sp?) my potential.  I encourage everyone else to do the same.

        The values of spontaneous order seem to have been lost lately.  List
members don't seem to take action upon themselves to make our potential
kinetic.  I can understand the want for the time and situation to be
right...I agree wholeheartedly...but we cannot sit around wallowing in our
own stagnation of potentialities [not insinuating that we all are].
A lot of crap was dished out to Michael Lorrey for his new site (which I
have not yet seen).  I am not a physicist, but I respect Michael greatly for
his ability to *create*, whether or not it works (and I believe it shall!).

        Another thing that has been irking me a little bit lately is the
view of 'dynamic optimism'.  I am dynamically optimistic, but I am also
realistic.  Dynamic optimism becomes altruism when there is no tact or
reality incorporated.  What I (and Eliezer etc.) have been seeing is wishful
thinking.  "Yeah, such and such will happen at such and such a time."  It's
kind of like a blind faith.  You have to do all you can to *ensure* that
things will happen.  How many extropians have stock in nanotechnology
companies right now?  Space exploration companies?  ANY extropian companies?
It is much better to put all your eggs in one basket if you really want the
eggs to get to the same place at the same time ...see what I mean? <g> 

        Chris Hind said:

>If I may speak for the group as a whole: Take action NOW! Do WHATEVER YOU
>CAN!

        I second that.  (Wow!  I'm actually agreeing with Chris for once
:-))  To quote a verse from one of my poems:


        I may never reach my goal
        My lunacy might take its toll
        But if perchance I ever die
        At least I had the balls to try

        I can't resist to post this poem on this thread.  The poem was
written quite a while ago, though I find the meanings to be very true
and relevant to this thread.  BTW, if anyone is getting sick of my
self-indulgence on this list (e.g.:: posting poems), please tell me and
I'll tame my ego a little bit.




Faith Or Freedom


You are born into life
Programmed
And one day you'll be forced to decide
Faith or Freedom?
Both have profits, both have fault
But only one can make you who you are
And when it comes right down to it
One will limit, one will get you far
The choice is up to you
Because you know what to do
Live to obey
Or wander astray
And one day you'll be forced to decide
Faith or Freedom?
The choice is bold
It can't be sold
The wall is yours
Or you can build some doors
But what it comes down to
Is the choice
Between a chosen fate
Or a god to dictate
Your Faith or Freedom

Unfortunately, the words "agnostic" and "atheist" are not very 
precise and have a great deal of overlap, and yet are not synonyms.  

One of the most lucid discussions of the various kinds of atheism and 
the meaning of the word itself is the introduction to atheism faq for 
the ald.atheism newsgroup.  It clears up much of the fog surrounding 
the words "atheist" and "agnostic".  It can be found at:

I agree.  It is the application of doubt that leads to the
elimination of error and an increase in the accuracy of one's ideas.  
By constantly questioning and refining our own belief system we can 
progress closer and closer to truth.  Faith can only interfere with 
this progress and create stagnation.

The driving force behind scientific and technological progress is 
doubt, the opposite of faith.

Me.  For a good reason.  On many occasions, I know things that are
drastically relevant and I keep my mouth shut, because the ideas
involved are:

1) Dangerous
2) Unpublished
3) Misleading without an extra 40K of explanation
4) Not backed up by experimental evidence
5) Likely to provoke a backlash
6) Aren't worth the effort of defending
7) Are beyond the ability of normal human beings to understand
8) Would provoke religious riots if explained

Got it?

Good poem.  It counters the destructive "Everyone needs something to

  The December issue of Byte magazine has an article entitled "Eight Ways to
the Future:  The Future of Microcomputing" in which a panel of eight
luminaries provide thoughts and predictions.  Byte presents this information
as snippets in a tabular format - a style which makes superficiality
difficult to avoid.  Check out http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art7.htm

Three discussants mention nanotechnology:

Marc Andreessen, Netscape Communications
David Chaum, DigiCash
Doug Engelbart, Bootstrap Institute

Excerpts:

Question: How long will Moore's Law continue to be relevant?

Answer: Marc Andreessen: Through 2020, when we will see a discontinuous
improvement in performance rejoining a new Moore's Law curve based on a
transition toward molecular nanotechnology.

Question: When will quantum effects and other problems require radically new
chip technologies?

Answer: Marc Andreessen: Probably until about 2007. By that time, however,
dramatically new chip technologies based on quantum dots and tunneling will
have begun to arrive.

Answer: David Chaum:  I'm not sure we will be forced to develop
nanotechnology, but I sure hope we do.

Answer: Doug Engelbart:  We'll run out of gas in 10 years. Eventually we'll
be arranging individual molecules.

Question: Will we manufacture chips in zero-gravity environments in orbital
fabs anytime soon?

Answer: Marc Andreessen: Only as an unlikely and distant possibility.
Nanotechnology will have begun to bear fruit before zero-gravity chip
manufacturing makes sense.

The Engelbart comment above is ambiguous since one can manipulate individual
atoms without having a nanotechnological capability; however, in the
introductory article at http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art6.htm
the following appears:

   Adds Doug Engelbart, legendary inventor of computing technology and
   founding director of the Bootstrap Institute: "If you look at the whole
   array of digital technology, the microprocessor is just a part of that.
   Nanotechnology will eventually take us way beyond [microprocessors]."

I too believe that Mike Lorrey was dished out alot of crap that was totally
unfair. In the case of spreading our memes, I have an analogy for this.
Lets see how well I can explain it. The population is like fuel for a fire
(meme fuel, hosts, whatever you want to call it). What we need to do is to
create ignition, heat up the idea by spreading it until the point that it
burns the fuel rapidly into a gigantic wildfire out of control. In this way
it is also alot like creating the first controlled fusion reaction where
the ignition is the difficult part because variables need to be *perfect*
and continueing the reaction is the easy part. All you need is a spark to
ignite a raging brushfire. Lets ignite that fire 
by selecting the people who would be most effective at spreading the memes,
contacting them and add them to the collective of the group. (No BORG jokes)

I'm sorry I never read that one. That _IS_ quite good. I never imagined
we'd agree on something! hehe
To quote the movie "Independence Day" "We can't be consumed by our petty
differences anymore. We will be united in our common interest." This
concludes that we should not bicker over the little things. Lets just get
out there and do the damn stuff! Lets consider some of the things we can do
with just a first glance.

- Invest in extropian-related companies (nanotech, genetics)
- Attend extropian meetings
- How about we pick a night for an IRC meeting where we can discuss topics
in near-realtime?

Any others? Forget your criticisms for a moment! Lets work towards a better
future!

Yeah, I knew it was you, I just wanted to see your response. In which
case it surprises me that you would explode at me not telling you
everything about the drive. Be sensible. If I am to ever make a buck off
it, I need to keep the real important parts quiet for now. I would think
that you would understand this.

In the meantime, I will be putting up a nondisclosure agreement which
people can download, print, sign, date, and notarize and snailmail back
to me (sorry, PGP doesn't cut it in court yet). If anyone REALLY wants
to know more, they can go through the rigamarole of showing they will
keep my secrets. I would especially appreciate the input of people like
yourself who are both proactive and rather analytical to help put the
finishing touches on some things....

Thanks, Chris. I really had a big debate with myself if I was even going
to put a page up explaining it, for exactly the reason that occured. I
finally decided that the computer simulations were enough to be
reasonably sure that it did _something_, and given the one big hitch
these guys so quickly came up with (that I have known about for a while)
has been taken care of (I turn it 90 degrees and use some
counter-rotation) I feel reasonably secure that things shoud in the end
turn out ok. Outisde of maybe one paragraph, I really tried to keep from
reciprocating the flamethrowing, and I appreciate ELiezer's decision to
chill out until I get a real model finished that either works or doen't

We should try to really promote meetings on college campuses. i don't
know if Max More is in the mood for a speaking tour, but I think that we
should set up inaugural meetings on campuses of Extropy Chapters that
Max or another extropian leader can help kick off membership with some
rousing lectures, maybe if we have some multimedia to go in the
presentation....

This is just the sort of stuff that I tried to motivate people for on
the >H list and got a bunch of crap back from the rugged individualists
who didn't want to have to actually contribute to a group or make an
effort. Lets hope everyone starts getting motivated.

BTW, thanks for all the constructive feed back on my site. Things are
more fixed than before, and I'm working on the rest...Though, I have set
the text on the front page as a light tan (to look like it was carved
into the wood), so I can't see how it would turn up blue....

Ahh! Very good. I glad to see that we're now into talking about action and
doing something to actually cause our desires to happen, instead of all
this mental masturbation and copulation.

So maybe this is the time to again bring up the subject of making sure that
we are all still around to see those dreams come true. Most of you profess
to embrace the ideas of cryonics. But surely you know that cryonics is very
problematic at this time for many reasons. The damage that is being done
during even the best cryopreservations may be completely obliterating
memory and other precious mental attributes. We have no proof that it is
not. And the movement is so small that it may not have the power to get you
safely through to future restoration. What we need is a proven method of
supended animation which is clearly demonstrated to work and by doing so
will increase the size and power of the cryonics and potential immortality
movement. The science of cryobiology has now advanced to the stage where
this goal is realistically feasible with relatively small funding.

That is the goal of the Prometheus Project of which I am the founder and
chief promoter. Several members of this list have already made pledges to
fund this Project to conduct the R&D necessary to achieve fully reverisible
whole-body human suspended animation within 20 years. You can find out who
they are by looking at:

http://www.prometheus-project.org/prometheus/pledgers.html

No money is being requested now; all pledges are conditional upon the full
amount of $1 million per year being pledged and upon approval of the
science and business plans. The pledges are for the purchase of shares in a
for-profit corporation which will be formed to execute the Project. If you
cannot afford to pledge the minimum of $1000 per year, you could find
someone else and do so jointly. In addition, I need help from people with
good ideas, and the energy to implement them, in promoting this project.

"The Powers are beyond our ability to comprehend.  Get the picture?"

No.  I don't.  It's possible, but I've seen nothing to indicate that
belief in Powers capable of thought we are intrinsically incapable of
understanding, Power capable of "solving the First Cause", is anything
more than religious faith.

Here's what "Perceptual Transcends" mean to me.  There's a picture in
_GEB_ of all truths (or theorems) and those which are recursively
enumerable, if I remember my terms correctly.  The former is a square
containing the latter represented as a fractal tree.  If that tree is
all of human knowledge, everything we have learned through millenia of
trial and error, and a newborn Power has every branch of that tree as an
obvious primitive, it is still inside the square.  It can more quickly
explore several more fractal branch-layers of truth, but all those
truths could well be still comprehensible to a broad-minded human with
enough time and desire to learn.

The Enlightenment after Newton thought of the universe as a clock.  More
recently we thought of the universe as a computer -- but that's really a
more complicated clock.  Now we have quantum mechanics and the metaphor
of cellular automata running around... but the universe still seems
fairly conceivable as a complicated clock with dice in the spring.
Perhaps those dice represent something fundamental we don't know... but
perhaps not.  Dice make at least as much sense as a clock.

And we -- or many of us -- seem to be universal Turing machines, or
capable of acting that way.  Given this view, it is hard to see how the
universe could generate any problems not capable of being comprehended
by us, apart from existence.  There could be things our minds aren't big
enough to grasp, ideas we don't have the memory to hold the parts of;
there could be Powers capable of thinking faster than we do; but those
are the differences between a computer with 16 megs of RAM and 4K, or
between a Pentium and a 8086.  A qualitative difference would be that
between any computer and a wristwatch.  To believe that there is such a
difference above us is purely a matter of belief.  Act on it if you
wish; I find myself believing that no Power could do something which a
liberal-minded cosmopolitan could not understand, given time and data.

My very vague thesis: All undamaged human beings, and other sentiences,
share the same area of comprehensibility.

Corollary: "I" may never know if I'm wrong.

Its starting to look less and less that you're a crank now that you're

Something VERY BAD has occurred. I was discussing the possibilities of
nanotech with my father when the idea came to my mother that in "The Book
of Revelation" in the Bible it says something to the effect of "People will
search for death but death will flee from them" and she contributed that
factor to nanotech. She's anti-nano now and shes already spread the meme to
a few others and even worse is the fact that she's the leader of a church
fellowship! Aughhh!! She better not spread that meme any further. Memes
like this will continue to develop and we MUST STOP THEM by throwing out
counter memes.

I guess I was talking about the time to find a program that I could
look at it with.  There's also the "camel's nose" factor -- people's
idea of what's "not too big" tends to drift -- and want to
encourage people to keep large things in a single location for
interested parties to peruse, rather than mailing them out shotgun-
style.  Even at 43KB, that JPEG is 8 to 10 times the size of most
email I get.

Speaking of time, I'm done.  This instance aside, my request stands.
I like short emails, and I prefer that artwork, even of subjects that
fascinate me, not be emailed to me.

One voice (but it's my voice, dammit!),

If suspended animation is what you're after, why isn't any effort going
toward hormonal suspension or slowing of metabolic processes? Such drug
induced hybernation in my opinion is much more realizable and most
probably less damaging. The fact that there have been documented cases
of individuals going into spontaneous hybernation for years at a time
makes me wonder why no effort is going on in this area. Surely slowing
people's metabolic rate to 1 heartbeat per minute would not only be a
great interim solution to outright suspension, but advantageous for use
in surgery.

A primitive version of one of my earlier designs was granted a patent to
a gentlman by the name of Richard Lieurance on Feb6, 1996. His design is
still a very basic mechanical version. Apparently it works enough to be
granted a patent. I am applying for a patent for a couple of my advanced
versions. I have not found anyone working on this concept to the level
of sophistication I have, so I am reasonably secure in obtaining a
patent on it.

If you want to check this out, the listing and abstract is located at:

http://fetch.cnidr.org/cgi-bin/patbib_fetch4?/pto7/NEW/INDEX+PATBIB-76-96+30357+0+20+10441+OF+193+3834+151+propulsion

Using the PTO links you can even get a copy of the patent online for I
think a charge on your visa of like $3.00. 

I've talked to this gentleman's lawyer, as he is unreachable, and am
awaiting further contact...

I am interested in finding out if he is developing anything with it.
It's funny, there happen to have been a slew of UFO sightings in this

Sorry if sunrise and sunset don't correspond to your daily life.  I tried
to make them widely accessible.  If you want to return the phenomena (the
subjective experiences of a sun's seeming to rise and set) and their names
for a refund, I can use them (they're a couple of my favorites, actually).
If you change your mind later, you can rent them from me.  My rates will be
reasonable, but not as low as you were paying.  I must warn you that the
experiences won't be quite the same as when they were free, especially
after you've disowned them and tarnished their names ("loser linguistics").

Which reminds me that "loser" is a word whose utility I've been wondering
about lately.

Yours,

Sorry Kennita. I'll try to make them smaller in the future. Sometimes,
like in this instance, a picture is worth a thousand K. It sure shut
people up, and reduced the noise level around here. I hope people will
also take the time to look up the patent citation I put in the last

I got a completely different reading, confirmed by a question-answer
period at the end of a reading (of other stuff) by LeGuin herself.

As I read it, at some point in the past, humans had "tamed" technology,
"put it in its place," and that place was mostly to store archives and do
science.  After taming technology, the humans had gone back to ways of
life that respected the ecology, etc., and this is what restored the Earth.

So in the story there were islands where there were computers and people
who used them, and computers on space probes, and otherwise most people
had little use for computers or any high tech stuff.

I remember thinking that this dismissed the question of taming technology
pretty lightly, so I asked LeGuin, was it just a literary device to get
tech out of the way and focus on the main issues of the story, or...?

At this point she got quite incensed (sp?).  She said no, it was the whole
point of the book: technology should be put in its place.  If so, I don't
remember the book giving much of a clue how.  Perhaps the story was meant
to show *why* it would be better that way, but how?  With this and Bob
Grahme's interpretation, I have two reasons to reread the book.

Btw, I recommend it to people who have Taoist leanings, who yearn for
simplicity.  Get the version with the audio cassette.  *As I recall*, the
book is written from the point of view of an anthropologist from...?...and
the cassette is excerpts from her field tapes.  They sound like real tapes
of real people from a culture you've never heard of, and the sense that
you're listening to voices and sounds from the future that's in
this book is really cool.

I think some of the posts on the meaning of TANSTAAFL are very good, but
some of them seem to be missing Heinlein's point.  I think he meant that --
one way or another:

 - Everything is caused by a reason
 - Everything is paid for by someone
 - Everything has a cost
 - For every action there is an equal -- but opposite -- reaction
 - A free lunch is still paid for by someone
 - If you think health care is expensive now, wait till it's free (PJ O'Rourke)

Or as Neil Peart said: 

"You don't get something for nothing / You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise / With the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be . . .
What you own is your own kingdom / What you do is your own glory
What you love is your own power / What you live is your own story
In your head is the answer / Let it guide you along
Let your heart be the anchor / And the beat of your own song"

That's exactly what hypothermia does. Continuing the hypothermia to low
enough temperatures slow all biological processes so much that
"hibernation" without decay for 100's of years is possible. If the organism
can be cooled to such temperatures without ice crystallization (a process
called vitrification) then no damage to the organism whatsoever occurs.

No hibernating animals, even frozen frogs and fish, can survive in that
state for longer than the normal amount of time for which they hibernate
(less than a year).

Sounds life the story of Rip Van Winkle to me. I've never heard of such a
thing. Are you thinking of comma's, or vegetative states, etc? These people
all need and get feeding and other bodily needs attended to. Do you have
any references to such examples of slowed metabolism? Maybe the reason why
no one is giving effort to this area is that there are no such examples and
the idea does not make physiological sense.

Do you mean attributed?  Anyway, to continue -

Calm down, Chris...   

Here is a counter-meme:  

The book of Revelation describes upheavals which sound very much 
like Artificial Life running amok.  It's a kind of grey goo scenario.  
There is something called, in Greek, "therion."  This is usually 
translated "beast," which is a valid translation, but there are other 
possible translations:  it could be translated "monstrous life form" 
or "artificial organism" or even "advanced being."  It is an unnatural, 
destructive creature of some kind.  Just as the grey goo threatens to 
destroy everything, Christ overcomes the beast and establishes the 
New Jerusalem, which is described as a huge crystal.  

Now, let's connect this with another idea:  The church taken as a whole 
is supposed to be the body of Christ.  Becoming a Christian is like 
being possessed.  You become a new person, and you no longer have 
a will of your own; you turn your will over to God.  The collection 
of all such persons acts together as one huge superorganism, in which 
Christ is the head (i.e. the mind, the part that makes decisions), 
and each Christian is like a finger, or some other body part.  I'm not 
making this up, it's standard New Testament doctrine.  

So, the collection of all Christians *is* the body of Christ.  Therefore 
when it says "Christ" does something, it actually means the church  
does something.  In other words, the church is supposed to play an 
active role in the Apocalypse.  You have, on the one hand, the "beast," 
and on the other, the body of Christ; they are both artificial organisms, 
and they both use nano, but one is entropic and the other is extropic.  

The true church is the church that will make the Apocalypse happen, 
and create the New Jerusalem, as described in Revelation 21.  

Once THAT meme gets started, there is no stopping it.  

Lyle

But hypothermia is an induced metabolic suspension, with the body still
burning sugars at the normal rate, etc. A true metabolic suppression
should be experienced as conciously as though the rest of the world was
speeding up around you, while the subject slows down.

Sure, because they don't need to. Do we know how they can stay under
that long? if so this should be used as a safe interim solution for
doubling or tripling terminal patients life expectancy by repeated
hybernations with interim waking periods for refueling etc...

I read a big article in Discover Magazine years ago (mid 80s) by a
doctor who had gone on a house call early in his career. When he got
there, he took care of the patient, then noticed a rather still
individual in a chair. "oh thats just grandpa" they said. He had a pulse
of one or two beats a minute. According to the family he had been this
way for a decade or so. Upon thyroid treatment, he was brought back to
normal metabolic rates, only to find that he was terminal with a large
tumor that had also been dormant during that period....

I think you mean 10^7 to 10^8, making 65 million years a
reasonable interval between such events.

That's a very interesting point, and probably correct. The flux
of comets reaching the inner solar system (and therefore the
frequency of K-T events) is strongly affected by the rate at
which other stars pass within ~100,000 AU of the Sun. That's
expected to be in the 10^7 to 10^8 range for the solar system.
This rate would certainly be much higher, perhaps a couple
of orders of magnitude higher, closer to the galactic core.
But I'm not sure how this would affect evolution. Mass extinctions
every few million years, rather than every ~50 million years,
might help intelligent life to evolve. A million years is
long enough to allow intelligent life to evolve. Frequent
mass extinctions might mean more frequent opportunities for
a species to evolve in different ways. Also, frequent perturbations
to cometary orbits might remove most of the existing comets
around a star, over the course of billions of years. So, 
although the flux of comets would be high at first, for a
star closer to the galactic core, there is no assurance
that it would remain high.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Conservation of momentum is a very well established physical law.
Conservation of energy can be a little trickier: you can have various
forms of energy, kinetic, chemical, heat, potential.  It can be hard to
account for where the energy is in a system and therefore hard to tell
if a system is really conserving energy.  Look at all the controversy
over whether the cold fusion experiments are producing more (non-nuclear)
energy than they are consuming.

But conservation of momentum is a lot easier to understand.  Unless you
are dealing with relativistic velocities, or really overwhelmingly huge
energy densities, the momentum is just a matter of multiplying each moving
mass by its velocity, and adding all those up.

Conservation of momentum and the other laws of physics are the basis for
our entire technological civilization.  If these laws were not reliable
bridges would not stand, rockets would not make it to the moon, machinery
would not operate.  Centuries of careful testing and measurements have
only confirmed the accuracy of momentum conservation in all physical
systems.  This is not just approximate conservation, this is perfect
conservation to the finest limits of accuracy available.

The notion that you are going to be able to come up with a
mechanical system which arranges moving weights "just so" and leads to
non-conservation of momentum is just so terribly unlikely as not to be
worth seriously considering.

I've greatly enjoyed the many discussions stemming from my suggestion of 
an Economy based on Peer Networking.  Unfortunately, I'm still 
formulating my theory as I present it, and judging from the many turns 
these conversations have taken, I've likely been too implicit in 
conveying my thoughts...

While the Free Lunch is a rare thing today, we are living in an open 
system, and Free Lunches (before history) have been the exception and 
not the rule.  I am not suggesting we all go back to the Stone Age... 
clearly it is not feasible to live the hunter gatherer existance that 
Humanity used to know.   But our methods of production and gathering 
have changed with time, and sooner or later, so will money.

In this Information Age, we have learned many lessons from the 
Industrial Era, both good and bad.  We have changed our sources of 
energy from natural sources to unreplenishable fossil fuels, and then 
back.  We have gone from conservation, to "bigger is always better," 
back to conservational downsizing.  It is entirely feasible for humanity 
to adopt a Free Lunch program, if there is significant interest.  
(Perhaps it may never reach Earth by the time it is adopted on 
extraplanetary colonies.)  If there is enough interest, humanity will
find a way to make it happen.

The reason we do not currently have Free Lunches is that the Large 
population of humans on Earth does not preclude the limited supply of 
food from being unfairly consumed by 'unfairly' small numbers.  
Food "just happens" on our world, but does not happen fast enough 
without the attention and technology of today's farms and producers.
The current method for controlling this is to ration our consumption 
by means of the monetary "merit system."  Yet for good or bad, this is 
not the only solution, nor is it eternal.

The idea of rationing treats the symptom, not the cause.  It controls 
only a person's excess of demand, not the shortage of supply.  As 
Extropians, I expect that we would be more interested in lifting limits 
on our ability to sustain ourselves.

I foresee a change in money for a few reasons:
 o Government Regulation tends to increase our need to serve money
   by causing even land owners to own taxes on land.
 o The past economy of depletible resources is being supplanted by
   an economy of undepletible knowledge and information.
   (It's not "spent" when shared.)
 o With every new invention, we see that there is less work that we 
   'have to' do, as more of it it done by technology.  Yet likewise   
there is less work we HAVE 'to do,' and jobs become fewer or less 
   rewarding.  Eventually, this could hit critical mass if the old 
   monetary "merit system" determines who controls the others' holdings.

It is a characteristic of humans (at least here in America) to desire
Freedom.  Yet we currently are enslaved to money, forsaking our personal 
interests in exchange for 'earning our keep.'  It was worse in the 
Industrial Era, where the few individuals who run the corporations were 
the ones whose personal interests the business best served.

These days, we are seeing a shift.  A business holds together if there
are enough players who are unified by a common goal or vision.  A boss's 
desires are rarely served by 'mindless masses' anymore... but there is 
still the power of numbers when a team is unified by purpose.  (And 
still the scarey existance of mass-produced mob mentalities.)  Yet these
days humans are not interchangible parts... they have skills, knowledge,
and interests that determine their value to a team.

Commodities are valued differently by everyone.  It puzzles me how the
stock market determines so much of value when this planet is actually
covered by six billion walking talking economies of their own!  Some
produce surplusses of their special commodity, but won't share it unless
convinced that your use would serve their interests.  (Often from a
marketting angle.)

There are some good reads found at http://www.newciv.org ,
but I still think that the solution lies in a paradigm shift,
from hierarchial client-server money-consumer notions, to 
a peer-to-peer sharing of interests and efforts.  If we make it worth 
while for people to direct their efforts together with our own, it could
conceivably obsolete the monitary system.

There is no "they," at least not yet.  I don't know of any Christians 
who think in such terms.  But now that the idea has been proposed, 
somebody will pick up on it, inevitably.  A new church will appear, 
with the explicit aim of making the Apocalypse happen.  They will 
declare themselves to be the only true church, and they will regard 
anti-scientific "Christians" like your parents as clueless and irrelevant.  

One of the cliches that permeates modern culture is the idea that 
Christianity is inherently anti-scientific.  Nothing could be more 
absurd.  Out of all the cultures that have existed on this planet, only one 
created modern science.  Science appeared in Europe, at a time when 
virtually all Europeans were Christian.  Pascal, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, 
Cauchy, and Riemann were all Christians -- and not just nominal 
Christians.  They took it seriously.  Show me six atheists with 
comparable mathematical achievement.  Show me an atheistic culture 
that has produced any non-trivial scientific ideas.  Even Galileo, 
who was arrested by the Inquisition, remained a Christian all his life; 
his quarrel was with the ecclesiastical bureaucracy, not with the church  
per se.  

What we call the "singularity" (for lack of a better term) will not 
happen by accident.  It will be brought about by someone who intends 
to bring it about, and that person will be fully aware that the very idea 
of the "singularity" has its roots in the Bible.

As stated previously, this system relies on conservation of momentum.
Here's a good analogy: conservation of momentum is what prevents solid
rings from forming around planets. All rings are congregations of small
objects, from ion size up to a few meters in dia. A solid ring would be
unstable because at one point or another, perturbations will shift it so
that its center of geometry separates from its center of angular
velocity, causing the same sort of phenomena as occurs within this
mechanism. THe thrust generated would cause it to get further out of
whack, creating even more thrust, until it eventually hits the planet.
This scenaario is what led to the mathematical proof for Keplers Law.

Oh, I understand completely!  I don't object to your keeping it secret,

I have a totally irrefutable answer to that which this reply is
unfortunately too early to contain.

I can still try refutable answers, though.

Would a blind man - someone more than blind, with the visual cortex
removed, who loses all ability to visualize two-dimensional spaces or
even remember what it was like to see - be able to comprehend an Escher
painting?  (The answer, incidentally, is "Yes, but only intellectually,
as a problem in constrain propagation.")

Perhaps in that "foil" sense, there will be some things the Powers can
offhandedly invent which it would take billions of lifetimes for a human
with unlimited memory to acheive a distant causal comprehension of, much
as a human might trace the action of the visual cortex neuron-by-neuron.

The totally incomprehensible things - it's too early.

If I may make a suggestion?  Start a new thread called "Extropian Form
Letter", devoted to building an outline for an article/letter/pamphlet
that would introduce the untutored to the Singularity.  I believe that
the Singularity meme would spread faster than the Extropian culture
because it's smaller, slimmer, less vulnerable, easier to remember and
easier to grasp, plus it's all you need to know to start looking into
the future.

Remember, this is an outline for an *introduction*, not an
*explanation*.

I'm requesting an outline on the theory that any individual Extropian
can implement it as an article or whatever, thus allowing it to be
published in multiple locations with multiple spins.  Also, I can't do
outlines by myself for cognitive reasons; all I can do is craft a lot of
paragraphs and hope they're in the right order.  My feeble take on V.1,
from an article I was working on:

Title:  "History Ends In 2025, If We're Smart Enough."
Reasons:  Introduce "End of History" to grab attention, "2025" to
emphasize immediate importance, "If We're Smart Enough" to dissociate
from tired doomsday memes (Greenhouse Effect) and religious/apocalyptic
memes that would only appeal to groups of a particular faith.

1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.
2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.
3.  Defines "Singularity."
4.  Is this a good thing?  Names factions.
5.  Doomsday faction.
6.  Uploading faction.
7.  Intro to nanotechnology.
8.  Nearness of nanotechnology.
9.  Nanotechnology replaces economy.
10. Gray goo problem.
11. Intelligence amplification.
12. Runaway positive feedback of IA.
13. Replacement of human society: End of History.
14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.
15. Summary: History is about to end.

Let us discuss the following issues:
1.  What material needs to be included in an introduction?
2.  In what order should that material be presented?
3.  How should that material be conveyed?  (Examples, digressions into
    specific paths, theoretical explanations...)
4.  What objections *must* be countered?
5.  What is being left out of this list?

<< Note:  This letter was originally written in response to the Star
Trek fundraising suggestion, but, I was later informed, never made it to
the mailing list.  I am therefore reposting it.>>

The bit about fundraising at Star-Trek conventions is impractical,
inadequate, but at least it's something. Still, I don't think we should
accept unearned gold at this point. Any serious push for the Singularity
should be funded by venture capital (if the venture has short-term
possibilities) or by a single rich veteran of the short-term pushes (if
it's a purely long-term thing or something too dangerous for venture
capital); anything else is just *asking* to become a cult.

Think of your job at this point as the laying of groundwork. At one
point, someone with major money will be stricken by a vision of the
Singularity, or someone with a vision of the Singularity will succeed in
building up funding. Maybe me. Maybe you. Maybe that Netscape guy,
Andersson or something. The point is, I'd like to see complete action
plans for all levels of funding between $10^5 and $10^10.

I'd like to see frequently updated, ready-to-use lists of all major
researchers involved in Singularity-oriented research, their current
salaries and funding situation, how much good some additional funding
could do and the potentialities for short-term profits.

I'd like to see lists of all the venture capital that would be
interested in funding Singularity-oriented ventures, with specialties,
generosity and control-freakness clearly indicated by business records
and interviews with former partners.

In other words, what I would like to see is a completely laid out plan
that can be polished in advance of anyone with the ability to implement
it. I don't want idealistic plans for a fan club that will someday rule
the Earth; I want hard figures. I want an analysis of the legal problems
faced by foundations, corporations, Internet-coordinated public
conspiracies, and any combination thereof.

Show the names of Extropian CEOs, CPAs and (shudder) lawyers who could
keep a corporation running. Put everything into place that can be put
into place with a little research, a little experience, some advice from
more experienced friends and access to the Net version of the Wall
Street Journal. As a start, you might want to try and form a group of
Extropian businessfolk who could form such a plan as a hobby. If there
are no Extropians who can run a corporation, that's a major roadblock
that we can start solving now. I don't care about MBAs, but if NONE of
us know how to do this, some of us better learn. I've read "Start Up" by
(I think) Jerry Kaplan, a story of a pen-computers company which was
killed by Microsoft, which seems like a nice place to start. 

You could be hit either by a really bright idea or by a lot of money.
Have detailed enough preparations in place for both, and one or the
other will soon come along. You may not be rich, but there are some
things you can do, and one of them is planning.

This is not a call to arms; do not send *me* email volunteering for the
project. Someone else save this document and gather the Procedure
Preparation People. After Triple-P gets a basic plan set up, I can stomp
it to shreds looking for logical flaws and then spin the tattered
fragments into something that works, but I can't start Triple-P itself.
That's a project, and a project requires a plan. I can't handle long
linear causal sequences well enough to formulate one, for reasons
explained in "Algernon's Law", the second Web page in my signature.

Even if I get hit by a truck, though, it might still be a good idea to
have a plan in place. One, it will get you thinking along the right
paths, practical ones. Two, you may go through the planning procedure
and find at the end that your plan requires neither money nor a
brilliant idea, in which case you may proceed to actually implement it.
Three, all kinds of interesting facts pop up when you think practically;
we may wish to know about them. Four, if we don't think it out in
advance, we will screw up. Five, having a framework in place will ground
all the conversations around here and make them much more interesting,
in the same way that science is more interesting than philosophy. Six,
building the plan will give everyone involved experience working
together on an Extropian project; this may be important later.

What needs to be planned? Let's say I want to start a corporation
devoted to building AI interfaces to applications. It's
Singularity-oriented because it will be developing AI that can be used
to organize scientific knowledge, and because the founders will be using
their gains to fund other ventures. Part one. Where do I start? Look for
venture capital? Write a business plan? Build a prototype? If I look for
venture capital, who should I go to? How much venture capital can I
expect and how many programmers can I hire with it? What types of fame
and/or credentials will impress venture capitalists? Which is most
impressive: A doctorate, having published a book on the subject, five
years of experience, winning a prize within the field, or being
world-renowned for something? Are any of the above absolutely necessary?
This, you understand, to see if I need a figurehead and if so, what
kind.

Where can I get advice? Where can I get advice on whether my bright idea
is any good - without, of course, giving the bright idea away? There
must be ten thousand books on how to start your own business. 90% of
them will be worthless. Does anyone have a list of the top ten? No sense
in duplicating effort; some of the step-by-step guides will already be
done.

Think practical, practical, practical. Let's all remember that we don't
care about what happens after the Singularity because IT'S NOT OUR
PROBLEM. Sure, I wrote an entire Web page about the Beyondness of the
Powers. But that was for the benefit of my fellow humans and was
intended to settle the issue by impressing all concerned on how *futile*
that kind of speculation was. 

Also, I tried to include arguments that were not just impressive but
scientifically informative. How to set up a Power with numeric intuition
is a problem that we, unaided humans, may need to solve before the
Powers take over. Not exactly a practical problem for the near future,
but it's something about which thought may be useful, especially since
it might be adaptable to a modern, non-Power CAD station or something.

We aren't going to get to the Singularity by singing hosannas to Powers
that won't even exist unless we do something! Start planning!

I would say to the anti-cryonics crowd:

In case 1: It's not fraud if the cryo-patient (while alive) voluntarily
agreed to let the cryo-technicians perform the procedure.  And the
uncertainties were throughly explained to the cryo-patient.  The whole point
is that in the future it might not be physically impossible to return the
dead back to life.

In case 2: It's not premeditated murder if the living human voluntarily
agreed to let the cryo-technicians perform the procedure.  Legally this is a
tough one, e.g, Kervorkian keeps going to court.

It's not fraud:
>>since even the cryonics technicians themselves admit
to the potential patient
>>that the future thawing process is unlikely to have 100 percent survivial
rate . . .
And the patient understands this and agrees to participate.

Sounds like this anti-cryonics person has a problem with voluntary human
agreements and a predilection for JAIL(!)  Book 'em, Danno!

You might find this amusing.  I stumbled across the Web site for the
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.  

http://www.vhemt.org/aboutvhemt.html

It's operated by Les U. Knight {great name; it sounds like a pick-up line };-}

However, I assume they're serious.  If it's a joke, I guess the joke's on
me, since I believe they're serious.

VHEMT wants to end all human breeding so that the human race eventually
becomes extinct in order to save the earth.  It sounds like they want to die
and all humans to die (after a long life, of course), so that the rest of
the planet can live happily ever after (without humans getting in the way).


Excerpts:

>We don't carry on about how the human race has shown itself to be a
>greedy, amoral parasite on the once-healthy face of this planet.

Then, a contradiction:

>In the end, the real "enemies" are human greed . . .

Please, tell me it's a joke!

This is incorrect. Neither the "burning" of glucose or anything else takes
place at the same rate during hypothermia. Eg. the heart rate does
naturally slow down and eventually stops altogether at about 16'C. The
major problem with hypothermia is that various biological reaction rates
decrease with temperature by very different rates. The relationship of
these rates is optimal for human life at or just below (sometimes just
above) normal body temperature, 37'C. The only other boundary point of
temperature at which the human body is viable over a long timespan is below
the "glass transition" temperature of the cryoprotectant cocktail/tissue
mixture. A "safe" value for this temperature is -140'C.

I agree this sounds great, but unfortunately reality doesn't always help
with our bright ideas of what the world could and should be like. No such
mechanism of suppression exists and the work of trying to find one (with
all the different biochemical processes taking place in the body) would be
an enormously greater problem (most likely not solvable) than finding a
whole-body reversible vitrification protocol. This last job is basically
just technological hunting. If it can be done (and the design space of
cryoprotectants -- even of untried combinations -- is very large), not a
lot of "fundamental" research should be required. That is the reason why
the project is as "inexpensive" as it is (compared with more fundmental
open-ended research) and why a time-to-completion can be estimated.

This has been looked into. In my opinion it would require a genetic
supplementation of human DNA with the appropriate animal DNA to produce the
neccessary anti-ice crystal proteins and anti-freeze chemicals when
prompted by some triggering agent. In any case, doubling or tripling a 6
months life expectancy period for a terminal patient, simply isn't going to
cut it.

I will ask my friend Steve Harris, MD about this, but I'm pretty certain
this must be an exaggeration. Yes, extreme hypothyroidism can slow down
many bodily processes, but it can kill you too, because it, again, does so
unevenly with respect to different body systems. And you still have to eat
and eliminate waste, and the institutional care costs would be
astronomical. One of the benefits of suspended animation will be that it
will allow more people who can't afford enormously costly operations (often
of only of short-term benefit) to be, less expensively, sent into the
future where their problems can be cheaply and easily fixed.

Norman Dean's patent is too old to be on the online listings, but I've
got a clip here from the manager of KeelyNet to me in which he speaks of
others work in this area:

Hi Michael!  Your Lorrey Drive is interesting and almost exactly what

a body of water at something like 82 fpm.....all from a box sitting in

The term "Singularity" was invented by Vernor Vinge in his novel,
"Marooned in Realtime".  It did have basically the same meaning you are
applying, a case of runaway intelligence amplification.  Interestingly,
in the novel it was largely a matter of the creation of a group mind, with
people able to interact directly at the mental level.  This is somewhat
different from typical Extropian ideas, which are more individualistic in
nature and would picture augmented individuals rather than groups.

The notion of a singularity as the culmination of technological promise
is interesting, but the future will undoubtedly be a very different place
even if it never happens quite like this.

Also, keep in mind that if a singularity happens as a result of subjective
speedup of human-like minds, then the qualitative effects will be different
from what a non-participant will see.  If everyone is thinking and living
life ten times as fast as before, then compared to clock time progress may
occur ten times faster.  But by subjective time progress will occur no
faster than before.  We have just re-scaled the passage of time so that
more things happen between each clock tick.

While the 2025 date may be effective for dramatic impact, I think there
is a lot of uncertainty over how quickly the various changes you predict
will actually occur.

> 1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.
> 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.

As I believe we have discussed before, the doubling we are seeing already
does depend on the existence of ever-faster computers.  So we are already
in the middle of a feedback loop, and in fact that is really why we are
able to see exponential progress (feedback is a characteristic of such a
growth curve).

As for actually getting intelligence amplification through the literal
creation of either artificial intelligence or uploading, both of these
are very uncertain in the time frame of three decades.  People have been
predicting breakthroughs in AI since the 1950's, but actually progress
has been almost non-existant.  And uploading will require breakthroughs
in a very large number of areas.  There are also significant ethical
questions about exposing conscious observers to the possibly painful or
horrifying experiences which this research would entail, which might
further retard experimentation in these areas.  Our current AI is so
far from reality that even consideration of such hazards seems almost
laughable, but if real progress is ever made this could become relevant.

> 3.  Defines "Singularity."

We have discussed different meanings for "The Singularity" on this list.
Some people take it to mean a literally infinite rate of progress, as the
name suggests.  Others see it as more of an event horizon, a point in
history where things become so different that people who come before
can't comprehend how things will be afterwards.

Really in a lot of ways we are in the middle of a singularity by this
definition right now.  Our species goes back hundreds of thousands of
years at least.  Yet people from only a few thousand years ago would
find most of our present activities utterly incomprehensible.  In this
view the "comprehension horizon" will continue to shrink as progress
increases in speed.

I am a skeptic about the short term success of nanotech.  This technology
has a fundamental chicken and egg problem: it is very hard to build an
assembler without having an assembler.  Once we get there things will be
fine, but that path is very uncertain.

There are going to be millions of atoms in an assembler.  It is going to
take a long time before we are able to put that many together accurately
using macroscopic techniques.  How much progress has there been in the
last few years since they spelled out "IBM" with atoms?  These things
move very slowly.

Personally I think the biotech or self-assembly paths are more
promising although they get less attention these days from nanotech fans.
But any way you go there are a lot of research problems to solve, and it
really isn't possible to lay out a timeline with any degree of accuracy
right now.

I'm not sure about this Meaning of Life stuff though.  By (some people's)
definition, we can't really understand what life after the Singularity
will be like.  Maybe the people will have more meaningful lives, but
maybe not!  We really can't know.


Even where I disagree with the specifics about the timeline, I do think
this is a plausible "big picture" approach to human history and it is
a good outline of issues that are worth thinking about.

There are several groups in existence who propose similar ideas, an 
extreme offshoot of the environmentalist arm of the neo-Luddites, and 
they are quite serious in their intentions (tho I cannot speak 
specifically about this group).  The moderate version of these ideas can 
be found in the Zero-Growth movement and in some of Planned 
Parenthood's releases.

Sad that they have chosen to end human existence rather than to tap 
our unlimited potential for change and growth.

I have it on pretty good authority that John Clark would not say that, 
he would say there are some things we can not prove or disprove now, 
and perhaps  never can. Thanks to the work of Godel and Turing we know that 
there are some true things we can never prove. However I have a hunch that 
John Clark would also say that if an idea can not help us understand how the 
universe works, regardless of its truth or falsehood, then we can certainly 
find a better use to put our valuable brain cells to than meditating on it.  
Somebody once told me that "Genius" is the ability to know when your mind is 
caught in an infinite loop, I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I am sure 
Clark doesn't claim he can prove that theists are wrong, only that they're 
silly.

I agree with that. For example, if I were to make an extraordinary claim and 
say that I had irrefutable evidence to back it up, but for reasons of my own 
am unwilling to show you the tiniest particle of it, then there would be 
absolutely no Scientific reason for you to take me at all seriously, doing so
would be entirely a mater of faith.

Yeah but what about the adrenal, insulin, thyroid and other hormonal
governors on the metabolism? If you could use drugs to regulate the
levels of such regulators, you could do a controlled metabolic rate
reduction at the same time you drop their temperature down to 40 deg F
or so. I've seen  the effects of the body's natural hypothermic "dive"
response as being a big saver in cases of people falling into lakes and
such.

I guess I just see use of such blunt raw force approaches as being not
as "unreliable" or easy on the patient. I mean what is the quality of
life going to be for someone who has to grow back 75% of their body (or
the whole thing for those who just have their head frozen)? WHile it may
be cheaper to freeze someone at the start, what are the costs going to
be at the other end to revive the person, and then rebuild them?

True, in many cases, but I would think that it should be developed for
people waiting for organ transplants, or waiting for FDA approval of
certain possible cures. I would guess that this sort of therapy could
become a widely used strategy for the hundreds of thousands of people
worldwide who are waiting for organs....

I guess I just look at the freezing concept as being really a one way
trip, like I really don't have any faith in John Clarks flash uploading
ideas either. I prefer gradual uploading and soft, failsafe hybernation
techniques.

Zero.  With the tech it takes to revive a terminal frostbite victim,
it's as easy to grow the body back as to repair it.  Besides, this is
all going to be post-Singularity and all costs at that point are
effectively zero.

Whoops!  Ah, thanks, but no thanks.
I discussed all that in my Singularity page.
http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html

I am not asking for a discussion of the issues listed.
I am asking for help building a form letter.

Let's just say that I'm familiar with everything you said, and - don't
take this the wrong way - so, most likely, is everyone else on the
list.  The question now is how to package our memes in a short,
attractive, direct and easily understandable outline, with individual
paragraphs being left to individual Extropians who write articles and
whatnot.

None of the issues you raised would be appropriate for an introduction,
being sophisticated objections and counter-objections that presuppose an
understanding of the material we are trying to introduce.  Book
citations are not to be used unless necessary.  Multiple paths to the
Singularity should be used only when each new Path adds necessary
information.

Your statement about the invention of the Singularity occurring in that
novel may be incorrect; my first encounter with it was in Vinge's
postscript to the story "Run, Bookworm, Run!"  We are not to mention the
word "Extropian" unless necessary; we are packaging the idea of the
Singularity, not the cult phenomenon.  Individualism is not a necessary
cognitive prerequisite to understanding the Singularity.  Leave it out. 
Group minds are intriguing but not necessary to an understanding of the
Singularity.

Before the turn of the century, quite possibly, and I said so both in my
original article and in my Web page.

I'll not respond to the rest, because again, you may have missed the
point.

I hold that the following ideas are necessary in an introduction and
initial presentation of the Singularity meme:

> 1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.
	The easiest argument to understand.  Attention-catcher.
> 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.
	Another easy argument.  Both give the flavor of the Singularity.
> 3.  Defines "Singularity."
	Having a snappy name and a simple definition is a memetic advantage.
> 4.  Is this a good thing?  Names factions.
	First thing that occurs to everyone:  Will it affect me?
> 5.  Doomsday faction.
	Seems to be the instinctive reaction; could be true.
	Catches reader's attention through a possible threat.
> 6.  Uploading faction.
	Defusing the instinct; making the Singularity attractive.
	We don't want federal bans on nanotech.
> 7.  Intro to nanotechnology.
	Nanotechnology may be the best way of conveying the upheavals brought
	about by the Singularity.  We can't simply say that the Singularity
will
	erase human society; we have to show it.
> 8.  Nearness of nanotechnology.
	Short-term threats/goals get more attention.
> 9.  Nanotechnology replaces economy.
	SHOW that the Singularity will replace human society...
> 10. Gray goo problem.
	It's not all roses.  The reader has a right to know, and again the
	threat of destroying the planet can grab the attention, although
	not quite so much after all the false alarms.
> 11. Intelligence amplification.
	Part and parcel of the Singularity, but hard to convey.
> 12. Runaway positive feedback of IA.
	Ditto.
> 13. Replacement of human society: End of History.
	The Singularity is not one of your petty memes.
> 14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.
	Ditto.  One of the ways to hook a meme in the mind is by
	making previously established memes dependent on it.
> 15. Summary: History is about to end.
	The meme as we want it to spread, once all symbolic groundwork
	is laid.

> Even where I disagree with the specifics about the timeline, I do think
> this is a plausible "big picture" approach to human history and it is
> a good outline of issues that are worth thinking about.

We are not giving a complete explanation!  We are not debating!
We are creating and packaging a meme and our sole goal
is that it infect a majority of the human race ASAP!

Can I have some constructive criticism of the *outline*,
repeat *the linear order in which the ideas are presented*,
and some debate over the *modules*,
repeat *which ideas have been chosen for inclusion*,
and NOT NOT NOT the ideas themselves?

On the other hand it might be quite a good thing to have any religious 
opposition start its opposition now, when the technology doesn't exist, and
therefore is less threatening. If they can be whipped into a "holy furor"
over something that doesn't yet exist, they can be ridiculed the way that
serious opposition to genetic research was in the late 70's.
Tell a populace that they "shouldn't" or "can't" do something, and you will
find them flocking to it.
Robert Maplethorpe's exhibitions would have been little noticed events save
for the efforts of the opposition to them.
If the opposition bases its case largely on the Book of Revelation rather
than serious discussion of the downsides of nanotech, and the social upheavals
it will cause, then much of the battle will have been ceded to the pro nano
side.
