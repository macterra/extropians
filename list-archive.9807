Today I was traveling eastbound on Interstate thirty in Texas and I passed a
"Books a Million" on the right hand side of the interstate near the state line
in Texarkana.  Cursory examination at sixty miles per hour revealed that it
was eighteen wheeler accessable so I pulled in.

I was running low on books.

Immediately acquiring a cup of overpriced coffee (hazelnut from the yuppie
coffe salon)...I begin to browse the stacks.  Since I was time limited I only
looked into the Science Fiction and The Science and Technology shelves.  Which
didn't take very long.

Happily this was one of the few stores that I've seen that seperates the
Science Fiction from the Trekkie stuff AND from the blatant fantasy (elves,
swords, dragons and such drivel)  Unhappily the drivel outnumbered the Science
Fiction by probably two to one.

Still...I managed to find a couple of books...including one by Peter Hamilton.
I looked for Banks but to no avail

It took quiet a search to find the Science section...it was so tiny.  I doubt
there were fifty books all told.  Even so I managed to acquire on that looks
interesting.  "Visions" by Michio Kaku.

But I also got angry.  (not an uncommon occurance for me...my "contempt"
runneth over all too often.

There...sitting next to the Feynman lectures on Physics....was the
"Quickening" by Art Bell.

I  couldn't let this slide and after some reflection I went and complained to
the manager.  I told him that it would be no less insulting to put say...the
Bible in his Girlie Book section (I dunno if he even had one...but I was
digging for a comparison)...I told him that "The Quickening" had no more to do
with Science than Tinkerbell had to do with astrophysics.

He was somewhat taken aback and seemed suprised that I should be upset.  I
further told him that there were probably five or six stacks devoted to such
nonsense and only one or two SHELVES devoted to Science...so I'd appreciate it
if it were kept "pure"...and not contaminated with such nonsense.

He told me the classification came from "corporate".

It figures.  A college degree can do wonders.

Hello:

What became of the "former" extropians list.  All that seems to be "in the
mill" is
chat between a few members about various personal subjects.

My original interest in the "exptropians" was the technical / scientific
postings, 
as in events, recently published papers, and items of interest in regards to
the "original" aspects of extropian related developments.

Is this now no longer the case???

I have no interest whatever in chit-chat and personal debates . . .
but I do very much respect the original thematic trajectory of what the
extropian organisation had as an agenda.

Has this changed?

Please advise accordingly.

most sincerely
Charles Ostman

What you are saying is that your new country will declare war on

for. You'd last a week.

I doubt that cosmetic surgery (unless very extensive) will interfere
the least with any reasonable life extension treatment. The reason is
that life extension programs have to deal with the underlying causes
of aging, and they are definitely not in the dermis and connective
tissues, but something more fundamental. Surgery is of course slightly
dangerous and somewhat stressful on the body, but that stress seems to
be rather minor over the long run (partially offset by improved self
esteem?); after all, our bodies heal much worse damage.

As for drugs, then things get trickier. There I think it is best to
stay on the cautious side, one should ideally only use the drugs that
are really necessary and use mental or bodily techniques to replace
the others. But of course, this depends on the drug, many of them are
well-tested and the side effects well known.

A good idea. One shouldn't just use every available option, it is
important to see how they fit together. This is of course very hard,
but at least some problems can be identified and dealt with by
forethought.

I think you miss the point of cryonics. If you are lying in liquid
nitrogen, you don't live at all, you are frozen solid. It is intended
as a last resort if current medical science cannot keep you alive. As
life extension goes, it is currently a shot in the dark.

Yes, and that kind of chit-chat is important for community forming,
right Anders? ;-)

There has been a split. This is the public list where (almost) anything 
goes. Purely extropian chat on a "select" list requires ExI membership.

What agenda? 

Anyway, you might want to check out the transhumantech mailing list
(has only the tech stuff, no chat) or "filtered extropians" which
has only the best postings. See http://www.transhumanism.com/lists.htm

The problem with the internet (web, email, netnews, irc) is the bulk of
material you have to read on your screen everyday and the difficulty of
reading words on the computer screen.

I think short paragraphs and whitespace and being brief helps.

I tried the Alexa thing which was OK, Netscape will build this in

I have a large number of bookmarks, which I now try to keep organised.
Netscape has good features for doing this.

I browse certain sites daily (eg. http://www.wired.com), since these
are often good overviews.  Few sites are actually updated this frequently.

Not generally.  I trust people more than robots and the software I tried
didn't seem to work very well.

I use filters in slrn to autoselect people's postings on netnews by name
(people with good reputation that write well - rare).  Netnews is now
pretty useless except through http://www.dejanews.com/

Of course the correct answer to this kind of statement is "So what?" Yes,
freedom fighters, free marketeers and criminals will have nukes and other
mass destruction weapons. So what? Things change, deal with it.

Sure, were I an authoritarian who wanted to boss people around in safety
I'd be scared stiff; bossing people around in secret is no fun, but you
can't boss them around publically without getting nuked by the freedom
fighters. So of course I would want to remove everyone else's privacy to
protect my power.

But for the rest of us, so what? Just move away from the people who are
likely to be nuked and hope you avoid the odd random crazies. It's no
big deal for those who don't want to boss others around. Unless Y2K takes
the government down then DC probably will be nuked in the next couple 
of decades. So what?

(Brin is another big government supporter, so of course he feels the same 
way as the big governors.).

Title
  Unusual effects of some vegetable oils on the survival time of stroke-prone
  spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Source
  Lipids.  32(7):745-51, 1997 Jul.
Abstract
  Preliminary experiments have shown that a diet containing 10% rapeseed oil
  (low-erucic acid) markedly shortens the survival time of stroke-prone
  spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats under 1% NaCl
  loading as compared with diets containing perilla oil or soybean oil.
  High-oleate safflower oil and high-oleate sunflower oil were found to have
  survival time-shortening activities comparable to that of rapeseed oil; olive
  oil had slightly less activity. A mixture was made of soybean oil, perilla
  oil, and triolein partially purified from high-oleate sunflower oil to adjust
  the fatty acid composition to that of rapeseed oil. The survival time of this
  triolein/mixed oil group was between those of the rapeseed oil and soybean
  oil groups. When 1% NaCl was replaced with tap water, the survival time was
  prolonged by approximately 80%. Under these conditions, the rapeseed oil and
  evening primrose oil shortened the survival time by approximately 40% as
  compared with n-3 fatty acid-rich perilla and fish oil; lard, soybean oil,
  and safflower oil with relatively high n-6/n-3 ratios shortened the survival
  time by roughly 10%. The observed unusual survival time-shortening activities
  of some vegetable oils (rapeseed, high-oleate safflower, high-oleate
  sunflower, olive, and evening primrose oil) may not be due to their unique
  fatty acid compositions, but these results suggest that these vegetable oils
  contain factor(s) which are detrimental to SHRSP rats.

I think that the ageism of our culture is going to seem pretty ridiculous from
the perspective of a couple of hundreed years.  Discrimination against the
elderly is not a transhuman activity as I understand it.

I think that Anders is right that things like face lifts and hair dyes are
unlikely to interfere with rejuvinating technology, when it arrives.  That is
because they are superficial changes.  Viagra and anti-balding drugs are not
superficial changes, and the the life extension effect of viagra is probably
fundamentally negative.  Our obsession with youth culture is interfering with
the transhuman objectives.

As for the transhuman persona, I feel that it is important to act as a
transhuman, not falsely appear as one.  Cosmetic surgury can mask the effects
of aging, so I avoid it.  Life extension is a fundamental change.

I think you underestimate the problem (I call it the problem of
destruction). Nukes are local disasters, but other weapons of mass
destruction are global disasters (like bioweapons for
example). Staying away from obvious targets is just useful if the
range of effect is reasonably small. As weapons technology (and other
technologies with potentially dangerous effects, be they fertilizers,
genetics or computer viruses) the crazies become more dangerous. In
the extreme case there exists some technology that allows you to
destroy the world from the comfort of your home; in this case the
situation is obviously unstable because there is a finite chance that
a maniac gets it and uses it per year. 

This of course assumes that there are no good defenses, that shields
cannot compete with spears. This is by no means obvious in all areas;
it might turn out that nanotechnological immune systems work fine and
we don't need to worry about grey goo, but that there is no way of
protecting oneself from a nuclear fireball (other than hiding in a
nuclear bunker all the time). 

Note that the real worry is crazies, rational evil people don't do
anything that would wipe themselves out or cause an enraged humanity
to track them down.

If there are hard-to-avoid mass destruction possibilities that crazies
may use we need to deal with it. The "classic" idea of controlling
access to new technologies is not always feasible (nuclear materials
are amenable to it, computer viruses aren't). 

The second most classic idea is to control or keep track of people;
this is what Halperin and Brin suggests (note that they are not
necessarily puting all this power in the hands of government, the
citizens also can watch each other, decentralizing power a
bit). Unfortunately it is not obvious that Halperin's truth machines
are possible (even if there are some intriguing results that
non-veridical memories have a different activation pattern from
veridical memories), it might be hard to implement and accept
socially, and even a fairly dense system of observation might miss a
basement lab. A high-power version of this is nanarchy, where an
autonomous system keeps everybody safe and within certain limits (the
problems of this have already been discussed in the past on this list
and in Extropy).

Make everybody nice, rational people is hard, but could bring down the
number of crazies. A saner society will likely have less terrorism,
but if the technological level is high enough even very rare crazies
would be a big threat. The only way to be sure is to guarantee that
*everybody* is nice, which more or less implies some form of
brainwashing. Not all such schemes might be entirely socially
infeasible (technical feasibility might be harder, though).  One
possibility would be that parents could elect to have their children
treated to become rational (plus all sorts of other desirable
psychological traits); the treated people would benefit and would most
likely have greater success in society (people want to have rational
people in important positions; if you are treated your chances of
being hired or elected are larger than if not), leading to more people
electing to treat their children. A kind of psychological Gattaca,
distasteful to many today but maybe not entirely bad. One problem
might be to avoid a polarization between untreated who regard the
treated as some kind of upper class (even if the treatment is very
cheap or even sponsored, there will always be some people who refuse),
it is this group where the dangerous crazies might come from. I think
it is worth looking into this possibility of increasing the amount of
rational, balanced people for us, because we ourselves can benefit
from it and it can be implemented at least in a partial form through
good upbringing and education for our own children.

We better have at least some partial solutions before the abilities of
lone crazies become too huge. I think it can be done, but it requires
some rational thinking without getting trapped in one's favorite
solution to everything.

I wonder about that. According to what I have heard, Viagra is
essentially a blood pressure drug (that was what it was originally
developed for), so if you have too high blood pressure, it should
actually be healthy (and in the hypotension case of course slightly
unhealthy).

A good point. However, looking good and youthful isn't necessary a
false mask.

I don't. Bioweapons haven't proven very successful in reality, and I don't
see why they should be a global disaster; sure, they spread, but in most
cases they either spread so slowly that cures can be found or so fast that
they wipe out the carriers before they get very far. I'm sure we can breed
some bioweapons to wipe out the vast majority of humans if we try hard
enough, but it will take a lot of work and a lot of money.

And, outside governments, crazies with mass destruction weapons are quite
rare; crazies tend not to amass the amount of money required to build
weapons which can kill millions or billions of people.

>there is no way of

Nonsense. There is a very easy way to protect yourself; don't be there
when it happens. There are many obvious nuclear targets on this planet,
and avoiding those reduces the level of danger by many orders of
magnitude.

So what? If it exists then you get off Earth. I don't see why we should
keep trying to play King Canute rather than accept reality and deal with
it. If that technology exists it will be used regardless of all the 
precautions you may take to prevent it; if you're there you're dead. So 
make sure you're not there.

True. But today a moderately educated crazie can buy enough ammonium
nitrate to blow up a block or two. Tomorrow he might buy an assembler
kit and release industrial strength disassemblers in the watru
supply. The point is that off-the-shelf stuff can be dangerous. As
Eugene pointed out, terrorists doesn't seem to have the R&D mindset,
but they can borrow the products of other minds.

Then you better make sure you have off-world tickets before black hole
generators (or whatever) become widely available in the stores. The
point is, you have to be able to move away *before* somebody starts
being dangerous. If you start to build your launchpad afterwards,
there is a real chance that it becomes a logical target. 

I think you miss my point in this thread: there is a real problem is
certain technologies of mass destruction become too available and
there are no good ways of protecting from them or avoiding them. Which
technologies are going to become troublesome and how to deal with them
must be looked at on a case-to-case basis; some are much easier to
deal with than others, and we have different time to implement
solutions in. Just saying they are no problem is hiding your head in
the sand, hoping you have an escape before they become dangerous.

And the fact that few do is strong evidence that the crazy threat is 
vastly overstated. Almost all such actions are reactions to oppressive
governments, or the actions of organisations infiltrated by such 
governments.

And if you're relying on keeping assemblers out of their hands as a
'defence' you will die when they get one. If, like me, you're building 
real effective defences you'll live.

This is called 'forethought', or 'thinking things out in advance'. Of
course I'll be off Earth long before then; because that's the only way
to be reasonably safe in these conditions. Others will wait behind,
relying on governments and others to protect them... and die when the
shit hits the fan. My 'so what?' attitude is the only sensible attitude
for a long-lived organism to take; I really think that many people around
here should sit down and think through the implications of an indefinite
lifespan, not just dream about it.

>I think you miss my point in this thread: there is a real problem is

But there are; I've given you the most effective defence against every
single one of them: don't be there when it happens. I'm talking about
living in reality, Brin and others are playing S&M fantasy games.

>Just saying they are no problem is hiding your head in
>the sand, hoping you have an escape before they become dangerous.

I agree; that's why I'm saying that we should accept that these things
are going to happen and prepare for them, not hope that police state
measures will prevent them (when in reality those measures are more
likely to precipitate the problems by increasing the number of freedom
fighters willing to take drastic action).

Here's a simple example: recently I've been ensuring that I can survive 
for at least a month if everything goes down because of the year-2000 bug. 
Most people are hiding their heads in the sand and hoping the problem will 
go away. If it doesn't they're in deep shit, if it does I have some useful
gadgets and either way I won't have any food bills to pay in Jan 2000.

And I'm the one who's unrealistic? No, I'm planning on having at least a
thousand-year lifespan, and I recognize that the only way to have such
a lifespan is to ensure that *I* have it. No amount of political action
will take the place of simply looking after myself.

Yes, getting into space, and putting some distance between yourself and
the earth asap seems like the only practical solution there is. Apart
from the island project (which is the only alternative as long as you
can't afford to get offplanet), it might also be a good idea to start
saving for a space ship. ;-) The chance that things will go badly wrong
within the next (half)century is too big for comfort. Certainly if you
consider that it was already touch and go when only a handful of
superpowers (considerably more stable than lone nuts/terrorists) had
access to weapons of mass destruction. It's a shame Artemis and such
will probably lead to nothing.

Sigh. You still miss my point: even very rare crazies with
sufficiently powerful weapons are a problem. It is a simple product:
population * proportion of crazies using big weapons * tech level =
amount of damage done. I don't think crazies are a major problem
today, but they might very well be in the future if the conditions are
right.

Did you read my analysis in my first post in this thread at all? I did
point out that limiting access to many such technologies is hard or
impossible. I also pointed out that it isn't given that a defense
exists against all technologies, although this is still unsettled.

In order to convince me that you are really realistic, you better
convince me that you can get personal off-world capability before the
risk posed by crazies with big guns becomes severe.

I'm really trying to clarify the issue, rather than propagate any
favorite political memes. Let's try to do some risk assessments based
on facts and reasonable extrapolations.

To mark@unicorn.com :

Trying to avoid the targets of crazies with mass destruction capabilities
makes no sense to me.  Where exactly would you predict crazies are going to
strike? They're CRAZY! You'd end up turning into an agoraphobic. Leave the
Earth? Temporary solution at best for a long-lived organism.

I understand that we should all be concerned with our own welfare.  But your
"So what?" attitude is still a bit disconcerting.  Perhaps I'm misreading,
but it sounds like you're saying, "Just don't be one of the unfortunate
ones. You can't stop crazies so don't even try. Save your own butt."  I hope
this is not a common perspective among extropians.  I don't conceive of
Transhumanism as being about ME transcending MY limits, but about US
transcending OUR limits.  Your solution hardly reflects any humane concern
for the safety or welfare of innocent others, perhaps less enlightened or
informed.  If we had some ideas about how to minimize the danger, wouldn't
we be ethically obliged to do something about it instead of just stock up on
groceries and such?  This subject obviously carries into the ethics string,
so I'll let it be.  I agree with Anders in that the problem is real and will
require substantial attention because so much will be at stake.  Wouldn't
the principle of dynamic optimism suggest that we take a more productive
approach to the problem than *avoidance*?

S.B.

Doesn't sound entirely convincing (why no data?), but it is all a
question of the number of watts of course - enough energy will likely
do damage at least. The effects claimed sounds like the claims for low
frequency sound waves, but as far as I know the effects are not very
reliable and people react differently to them. If you are going to
produce pain with the ultrasound, you will likely need to use such
intensities that they can do real damage (opening yourself to being
prosecuted yourself).

Some seems quite reasonable, but I don't think one should rely on
high-tech obscure systems too much (beside the appeal to us
technophiles, of course! :-). In order to deter theives, psychology
and a bit of common sense may be more efficient (see David
D. Friedman's analysis of the rationality of theft at
http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Academic/Hidden_Order/Hidden_Order_Chapter_20.html,

	Look, "they"  are far more than childishly "pissed".
	What "they" are is - untrained, uneducated, unskilled and illiterate - we are
talking seriously unempowered, unfed, molested, ill-clothed, peer-pressured
into gangs (don't even get me started on that) and 99% possiblity of drug use
and arrests by about fifteen.

	Unprepared - by the Darwinistic environement they sum up from - to do much
good for themselves.  

	Many choose crime OVER welfare, not because "they" were rejected by it - more
likely because 1) they are suicidial or 2)  they have too much indiginous
pride to eat out of the gov'ts piggy "trough".

	If one has the balls to stop badmouthing people and making sweeping
generalizationst  and go in and try to actively reform an individual who was
raised thusly, (excluding the ones who are too brain damaged from crackparents
or mal-nourishement) one usually finds - not your imaginary  spoiled child,
blissfully living off the tit of the welfare system, but a *grief* stricken
young man, living in a war-zone, most of his friends dead or insitutionalized,
beat to shit by the teachers, the cops and hearing that demeaning crap from
people like you - pardon me for saying it.

He is left bereft of his most precious assest, his self esteem and the
knowledge that he has anything to contribute.

Yet he still has willingness and hope that he will find a job, a family and a
life.
Yet he still has energy to learn new skills, to make art and have ideas.
Yet he still wants what many of us do: respect, money, and power....

Exactly! 

(sorry for getting game theoretical)

The extreme individualist solution of just trying to avoid the crazies
is not as fit as a cooperative solution under a wide set of
assumptions (under some assumptions such as the possibility of
extremely powerful untraceable attacks cooperation might not be
optimal, but we are clearly not in that domain *yet*).  We manage to
deal with the problem of destruction today rather well by tracking
down offenders and punishing them (it doesn't matter if it is done by
the king, the police or a PPL).  One doesn't even need to care about
other people to adopt a cooperative strategy if it is more fit and
evolutionarily stable, it is the rational thing to do.

What I want to find out is:

1) When do we have a problem?  (This involves estimating the risks of
various technologies carefully)

2) What solution strategies exist for this problem?

3) Are they good enough that they can handle the problem?  (And what
are their limits, when we *should* run up into the hills?)

4) How to implement them? (Even the best solution might be completely
impossible to put into use, we need to find solutions that can be
implemented for real)


I'm a bit worried that the discussions on this list (and elsewhere)
tend to be dominated by less well considered opinions (or what
*appears* to be little considered opinions at least). There are many
people out there who actually think extropians are gun-toting
survivalists beliving in a technocalypse, and all this talk about
creating heavily fortified island nations, surviving the Y2000 problem
and escaping into space doesn't help that image. 

Let's use rational thinking instead, and use our tools of theoretical
applied science, game theory, economics and sociology to do some
serious analysis of the problem.

It might be that governments are the cause of new bio weapons being
unleashed on populations. Look at the South African attempts at race
selective weapons.
Or closer to home, the AIDS connection.

Something kept me from posting my thoughts and feelings on The Truman Show
for a good while.  I don't really know why, but I didn't like how it kept
coming out on the screen.

Then, this weekend, I saw the film again, and was inspired to buy the score
at the nearby Virgin Music Megalopolis.  

And now I realize something.  (Forgive my clever inarticulation of the
following.)  The music from the movie _feels_ Extropian to me.  Spontaneous
Order and such... what's a better example than music improvisation round the
clock?

A note about the score... it's by Burkhard Dallwitz, with multiple tracks by
Philip Glass.   In fact, two of my favorite bits are originally from Anima
Mundi, a very well-produced (and narrator-free) special on PBS a few years
back.  Philip Glass apparently scored the entire thing.  

But all I know about him is that he "appeared" briefly on South Park for the
Christmas "Mr. Hanky" episode.  Has anyone anything more on this guy?

Dale@Socrates.berkeley.edu makes a good point, and makes it well.

It is well worth while studying the literature on deception operations in 
espionage (Epstein's 'Deception' is a good place to start), and examining 
the manifold avenues to 'invisibility' that exist in the natural realm.

LOOMPANICS do some useful books (you may wish to use a cyber-cafe or 
anonymous browser when accessing the site, for obvious reasons).

In all Police States, you are 'free' to do whatever the State wants you to 
do, or is indifferent to.  A major point to remember is that if the 
State's officials want you in prison, that's where you'll probably go.  
Whether you've committed any serious crime or not has very little to do 
with it, alas.  The 'rule of law' has almost completely disappeared.

And remember that most of the (aptly-named) 'criminal justice 
system' is informer-driven:  that is: informers tell the police who they 
don't like; or whose business they want; or whose apartment they want; or 
whatever.  When the police come under pressure to produce 'results' they 
ask their informers to suggest a few names.

A growing similarity between the United States prison system, and Nazi 
Germany, Stalin's Gulag and the Chinese Lao-Gai system is that it's 
economically-driven.  The bureaucrats use the inmates as cheap labour for 
public works schemes (in Seattle, the munuiciopality can rent eight 
inmates and a supervisor for $30 a day in toto for highway cleaning); or 
the inmates can be rented out to 'private businesses' for rates well below 
minimum wage.  The 'consent' of the inmates is quite tenuous, obviously. 
Any money received by the inmates is taxed to pay for their incarceration.

And with 'private-enterprise' prisons, there's hardly any brake at all 
left on the growth in prison population, which is currently at 1.7 million 
and rising.  5 to 6 million Americans are imprisoned over the course of a 
year, and the number's increasing.  Thank the ersatz-'Republicans' for 
this -- the prison population has _tripled_ over the past 18 years.

If you're rich, and have good lawyers, and political connections, well, 
that does help, of course, as it indeed does in every country in the 
world.

But "America the Free"?

"Kiss it goodbye", as the Eagles sang in 'The Last Resort.'

Actually here in America the welfare state is primarily set up for the
single mother. A single, young male has a very hard time getting
welfare

Salutations fellow extropians,

Some time ago I read a post about a new theory that states that the
fundamental level of existence, even below quanta, may turn out to be
information.  Can someone repost this or provide info about any books/urls
written on this topic?

Thanks,

I've been a Glass fan for a long, long while.  In fact, I think I can lay
claim to turning Max More onto the composer!  Max and I, when we shared an
apartment, often enjoyed listening to the soundtrack from "Powaqquatsi."  The
powerful scene where Truman starts to enter his office, only to spin round and
round the revolving door as the realization of his condition fully hits him,
uses music from that soundtrack.

I prefer the earlier soundtrack from "Mishima," a portion of which served as
the backdrop for the climatic scene where TS hits the wall of his world.  If
you liked that, I can also suggest the soundtrack from "Koyaanisqatsi," an
incredibly powerful work that, unfortunately, serves to advance a rather
entropic message.  Happily, Glass himself has evinced a love of high-and mega-
tech--see his liner notes to "Itaipu -- The Canyon."

Be forewarned: The subtle and lengthy works that Glass wrote relatively early
in his career do not suit many tastes.  His works of the last decade or so use
somewhat more obvious melodic structures (too obvious for me, at times).  But
by working backwards, even impatient listeners can come to appreciate Glass as
a pioneer and giant in minimalism.

What has not been mentioned is the welfare system is a poverty generating
system. All liberal and conservative approaches are wrong as they reinforce
anti-work behavior patterns. I see this every day even at the University
level and can't comprehend how bad it must be in the K-12 system. Martin
Haberman identified the key issues in his "Unemployment Training" in Phi
Beta Kappan
(March 1997).

The key values of the welfare system are:

it's not your fault

nowness -- learning by sound byte

showing up --all you need to do is show up and not be disruptive and you get a B

teachers are responsible for my success-- if I fail it is your fault

excuses -- if you have a good excuses you are not responsible

noncooperation

lack of respect for others

belief that authority is always out to get them

you can 'mess up" as much as you want and will be given another chance

explain success by luck, chance etc.-- not their own effort

require RELEVANCE for any thing they do

lack of purpose

failure to stay on task

ignorance of rules is a way to circumvent them

lack of investment in the school (social) system

Also, it might be an idea to find out who the
"crazies" actually are.  Contrary to popular
belief (to my knowledge) there is no mental
illness that makes people want to destroy the
world.  Most potential threats will have very real
reasons for wanting us all dead.

It was delight to this Sasha quoted in this piece -- and just while he is
staying with me and Natasha. He's out walking around Venice Beach, so it'll be
a nice surprise when he returns.

You can find Sasha's Hypereconomy article in the Dow Jones magazine? What's

Internet commerce could spur more and more economic swings 

Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 Reuters News Service 
LONDON (July 1, 1998 1:04 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Economic booms
and busts could become more frequent as shopping on the Internet takes off,
according to a study published on Wednesday. 

Jeffrey Kephart and his colleagues at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in
New York said that as consumers buy more goods and services online, they
increasingly turn to programs known as software agents to search for the best
prices. 

"These agents tend to exaggerate the worst market swings and create disastrous
price wars," the New Scientist, reviewing the research, said. 

Kephart said software agents are not subject to the restraints that normally
rein in economic activity. 

"Their transactions take place almost instantaneously, cost next to nothing
and
distance is irrelevant," he said. 

His research found that the rapid reaction of agents to price changes meant
"devastating price wars rage constantly, and providers' profits varied wildly
as they fought for business." 
Alexander Chislenko, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ran similar
research models and got the same results, the New Scientist said. 

He said "agent economies" tend toward the chaotic and "would be like trying to
control a car that was traveling at 500 miles an hour."

Of course, even if the government violates their
rights it's unlikely that the majority will adopt
these technologies (not that it matters).

In the style of David Brin's _Transparent Society_
it might be an idea to explore the effects of
greater privacy and anonymity in society. When you
can't be sure of anything, what happens? Privacy
creates paranoia, paranoia creates scepticism, and
scepticism creates either insanity or rationality.
Only the rational will survive (or maybe I'm
living in a magical privacy wonderland).

If you wanted to be really witty, ironic and
clever you could test Brin's theory by posting all
of these embarrassing outbursts to this very
mailing list (or the Amazon.com page for his
book).

Some extropians /transhumanists have guns yes, and others don't have
them but would *like* to have them. However, the majority seems to 
either not to care about guns, or outright reject them. Whether this
is good or bad is another discussion alltogether, of course.

> survivalists 

We certainly are survivalists. Not only we don't want to die
prematurely, we even don't want to die *at all*. We reject the
inevitability of death itself. It doesn't get more survivalist than
that! ;-)

> beliving in a technocalypse

Belief in the singularity is indeed pretty mainstream in transhumanism.
The possibility of a technogeddon is even mentioned in the transhuman
principles.

> , and all this talk about
> creating heavily fortified island nations,

Fotified or not (I prefer obscure myself), an island nation would
solve several problems at once (for example: euthanasia & cryonics,
freedom from idiotic taxes, right to take any drugs & treatments
you want, conduct all sorts of business that's heaviliy regulated/
illegal/overtaxed in other regions, unregulated use of gene therapy/body
augmentation etc.) In the case of a nuclear war or some other global
disaster, a remote island can mean the difference between life and
death.

> surviving the Y2000 problem

Although I personally don't expect any really serious problems, let
alone the end of civilization, it's better to be safe than sorry.
Stacking up on emergency supplies is relatively simple, and can
mean a great difference if, against all odds, things go very wrong. 

> and escaping into space 

Moving to space (preferably some time *before* the singularity/
some other disaster) is a very sound idea: distance is a great
defense; it buys you time to prepare for whatever comes
your way. If it turns out that there's no disaster, you can
always go back or whatever (and in space you're pretty much
free to do what you want, much more so than on an island). 
Of course the feasibility of escaping to, and living in, space 
is something else, but it certainly shouldn't be dismissed as 
paranoia.

> doesn't help that image.

Imo, the image is largely correct. Or at least it *should be*
correct. Right now there's way to little focus on the practical
side of facing the radical changes which we predict. Of course,
I know what you mean; the above libertarian-esque ideas have
been tainted by other groups, so we shouldn't talk about them
for PR reasons. Nevertheless, I think survival and prospering
are too fundamental goals to be compromised. If there's a way to have
our cake and eat it too (i.e. being a successful "survivalist"
group while keeping a "politically correct" image), then that
would be great, of course. Maybe it could be done by keeping
the "practical" institutions (if there ever will be any) at
least officially separate from the "educational" ones. In

Yes, of course. But isn't there already a consensus that there will
be very radical changes within the next 30-100 years? And given the
many wars and other violence troughout history (and even today), it 
is only logical to assume that sooner or later the new powerful
technologies will be used to cause harm. The fact that increasing
numbers of people will have access to increasingly more powerful
(potential) weapons only makes matters worse. Indeed if we do go
extinct, it will probably be within the coming decades. To survive
strange times, strange measures (like moving to space) might be needed.

Nice to see that there are other people who enjoy Glass. I just
recently found him, but I really enjoy the structure of the
music. Perfect for late night programming trances.

Yes, my office mate sometimes plays it to annoy me :-) But "The Grid"
is IMHO a musical rendition of the Singularity if I ever heard one.

Yes, outside B-movies few people are really out to destroy the
world. Psychologically speaking, one should maybe look at people with
persecution/revenge complex combined with severe megalomania, but that
usually tends to result in mailbombs rather than anthrax
epidemics. However, the group dynamics and memetics of the Japanese
doomsday sect should instill some caution - it would make a perfect
study object of the kind of crazies to look out for.

Otherwise I would study terrorist groups. They usually aren't that
technical themselves, but there are underground engineers for
hire. According to a friend a few years back one of the experts at
making bombs in Israel accidentally blew himself up, which resulted in
a marked decrease in the number of bombings - this suggests that such
underground engineers are relatively few and technological diffusion
to terrorism is limited in the post-cold war era. 

Not even terrorists go for wholesale destruction, it doesn't work as
useful terrorism. But they might want to have it as an option/defense
in the case things go badly: "If you touch us, all will go to
hell!". That is worth worrying about, since it seems to fit better
with the terrorist martyr mindset.

Overall, I think the number of crazies that would and could use
weapons of mass destruction is quite low. But they exist, and that
poses a problem. Personally I think we do not need to worry too much
yet, the available weaponry is limited, and we have plenty of time to
figure out how to deal with more technology. But we should take the
problem seriously.

A rather interesting argument Mark.  First of all, I think that we all have a
vested interest in keeping public officials alive while they're in office, or
at least safe from terrorist attack.  Second, what makes you think that
everyone, or even most, will be able to move away from those who will likely
be targeted?  Third, I'm afraid I don't understand how your response to the
idea of weapons of mass destruction proliferating amongst irrational
psychotics can be "so what?".  Surely the possibility of so much death and
suffering that could be caused requires more than a "so what?" response.

I agree.  However, terrorists can be sponsored or even run by foreign
governments.  Most of the terrorists who launched the highly publicized
attacks during the 70s and 80s were trained by professional soldiers, usually
coming from a special ops type unit.  They had access to enormous resources.
And so long as the United States tolerates foreign governments giving safe
haven and training to terrorists, this will continue to be the case.  But to
tie this all back in to the original point, the idea that most terrorists will
not have access to resources or training and that therefore we need not worry
too much about terrorism is simply wrong.

As long as its nothing but a moonlighting money maker for some NASA guys out to
make some bucks off of the clueless, it will get nowhere. Their studies may be
useful by serious businesses to make a go of it privately, but the real impetus
will only happen when a practical method of using Helium III in commercial
fusion reactors is available. When that happens, ships will launch by the
hundreds, if not thousands.

On the individual sovereignty side, we are beginning to see the start of the
migration to permanent oceanic living. The former Chairman of Norwegian Cruise
Lines is heading a company that is building a cruise Liner called "World of
ResidenSea" which will be a permanently occupied residential liner, with 286
condominiums. MAXIMUM condo price is $6.6 million.  With the cost of cruise
tourism dropping to the $200-1000 per day range, more and more people are taking
cruises (more than twice as many people as in the age of the ocean liner as the
only means of transoceanic transportation), which serve as an excellent PR
machine for permanent oceanic living projects. Of the 286 condos on this
residential liner, 65 are already sold, and the boat is not to be launched till
2001.

Most people learn at some point that the best way to avoid being attacked by
disgruntled desperadoes is to avoid being the sort of person who victimizes
people. This includes avoiding employment with governments that oppress people,
or corporations that abuse or take advantage of their employees or their
customers, and treating everyone I deal with personally with at least a minimum
standard of respect and honesty. Living in this manner automatically excludes me
from attack by 99.999999% of the crazies in this world. This does not protect me
from others who may want to take advantage of or oppress me or my family or
freinds. This is why I keep firearms and have knowledge of and potential access
to other materials that may be needed to oppose repressive organizations. It is
not to protect me from the crazies, who are almost always lashing out at the
sources or symbols of the sources of the oppression which they have suffered,
real or imagined. It is to protect me from the oppressors. Since the oppressed
are typically lashing out because they have become disempowered in some manner,
my overwhelming force of arms means that they are no threat to me or mine. The
threat to me is from those who have greater power than I, and my doing my best
to obtain a modicum of equalizing power helps equalize against that threat.

In my life, I have come in contact with crazies, and have treated them with
respect and dignity, and have suffered no attacks, no ill effects. For example,
when the LA riots were going on, there was also some rioting going on in
Seattle. I happened to be in a position where I was able to save a woman from
being attacked by a rather angry black man, and I did not have to raise a
finger, did not have to brandish a weapon. I know that this is rare, however by
not making myself a victim in the first place gave me the confidence to defuse
the situation without resorting to arms. If things had escalated I would have
been able to meet the level of escalation, and that confidence helped me.

If we each take care of ourselves, then we will all get there, won't we, since
we each individually have a primary motivation in getting there, while the
altruistic ethic is usually far less motivational.

Yes, it all depends on how much the government wants to crack down. If the
population is used to being free, there will come a point where a sufficient
percentage will no longer tolerate the opression. Any revolutionary program
starts with the revolutionary group staging minor harassing attacks, which
escalate goverment oppression in an effort to crack down on the brigands. This
escalation causes grater numbers of people to sympathize and support the
revolutionary cause, leading to more attacks and more government oppression.
There comes a point where either the government or the revolution will commit a
major outrage which will galvanize the public sentiment against it. This is the
deciding event in a revolution, the fulcrum upon which a whole nation can be
turned. In our own Revolutionary War, the events were the Boston Massacre and
the Battles associated with the famous Ride of Paul Revere.

This is how our government was able to use McVeigh's attack in Oklahoma City
against the burgeoning militia movement, and why the weight of evidence
supporting the contention that the government was at the very least aware of the
conspiracy (if not complicit) and let the attack happen seems so credible. If
McVeigh had staged the attack during hours where there would have been no
children in the child care center in the building, and when minimal numbers of
civilian employees were in the building, then the government would have been
hard pressed to make it look like such an outrage, and McVeigh's attack would
have been seen by enough people to be attacking a legitimate military target (as
defined in the Laws of War), that any laws passed by congress or enacted by
presidential fiat to restrict public access to firearms or materials with
explosives potential would have been seen as the most rank government
oppression, and would have escalated the level of conflict. As it is, it has
neatly defused the whole potential for wider conflict.

It all depends on how much you want to isolate yourself, and how much you want
to make yourself a target. Granted that as transhumanists, we are all targets of
hate from the fundamentalists and reactionaries of all stripes, which could in
time lead to violence, however, we aren't oppressing anybody, so we do have some
points in our favor.

Since the risk by crazies is currently near non-existent (you are more likely to
be hit by a plane falling out of the sky than attacked by a terrorist), and the
only NBC attack by crazies was the sarin attack in Japan several years ago. Show
me a nut with a nuke and I'll be ready to show you off world capability (If its
so easy for him to get a nuke, then it should be just as easy for me to build a
nuclear powered rocket!!!!)

Actually as I recall, in the informal, unscientific, anonymous survey I took on
this list this past winter, those who admitted to gun ownership out numbered
those who admitted to non-gun ownership by 2 to 1, and if you included those who
did not own guns but wanted to in the 'pro-gun' group, of all those who spoke to
me privately on the issue, around 70-75% were 'pro-gun'.

Since Prof. John Lott's research of FBI crime stats over many years has shown
that gun ownerhip conclusively reduces the incidence of crime, while most other
'less well considered' policies tend to increase or have no effect on crime,
that gun ownership is an important extropian theme.

Exactly. Personal defense is an important part of any longevity plan.

Yes, though most extropians disparage those who dwell so negatively on

Did any of you happen to notice that Phil Glass was actually IN the movie?
Second keyboardist, hunched over the keys, I think it was during the scene
where Truman meets his father and Christophe demands 'now, the music!' and
the two keyboardists produce a sappy swell of melodrama.

        Another similar composer (though not quite so minimalist) is Mike
Oldfield.  "Incantations" and "The Songs Of Distant Earth" (inspired by the
book, and highly commended by Arthur C. Clarke himself) are the most
extropic, and my personal favorites.

in the movie...
Not the case and I apologize for any misunderstanding!

Considering the era, clockwork and switchboards were actually pretty good 
ways to describe the way the brain worked, before the existence of computers 
they were the best ideas that could have been hoped for, certainly a hell of 
a lot better than spirits, demons or souls. Today we can do even better.

I don't think the analogy has been carried far enough. Most seen to think the 
universe is be divided into two parts, the human brain and everything else,  
with the brain operating under different physical laws from the rest of the  
cosmos, laws that will never be understood. I see no evidence that is true.
         

        >Our brains are different from computers not merely in terms of the

I think the difference is that present computers are much simpler than brains,

You keep making statements about the subjective mental states of cells and 
computers and lightning and other people, but that's a dead end, I  know 
nothing about such things and never will, all that I can observe is that I am 
conscious, everything else is conjecture. Intelligent behavior on the other 
hand I can study and observe in other things.

It doesn't follow, aspects of the world could be information, in fact they 
must be, and there is no reason there can't be information about that  
information, or information about that.

I have a hunch that individual cells are not conscious and I have a hunch 
that you are, although the only thing in the universe that I know with 
absolute certainty to have that attribute is me. It's irrelevant however 
because language doesn't need a frill like consciousness to work.

I wouldn't know, no two lightning bolts on planet earth have ever been

        >Lightning has many letters, formed by the different angles and

A language with an infinite number of letters is as meaningless as a language 
that has only one. Also, the genetic code has a grammar, for example, 
3 letters per word, lightning has no grammar.

But there are lots of messages that will produce nearly identical states in 
your mind, you will treat one gibberish message much like another even if 
they're quite different. You'll react to "dxjkhq" in much the same  way you 
would to "kszvbe". In language on the other hand even a small word like "not" 
can dramatically change the way you react to a message.

Actually, I was suggesting that automated communities of agents cannot
function properly in a complex and fluid economic environment, if they
communicate through price signals alone.  My suggested fix was to
automate sharing of knowledge of utility of various resources in
different situations, by augmenting the value representation signaling
system (pure economy) with non-scalar situational utility data flows.
My early experiments show that this "hypereconomy" represents a more
adaptive and efficient way to drive a complex multi-agent market.

  I do not think that anybody reading New Scientist could guess this
from what they quoted.  But hopefully, a few interested people may
look up my hypereconomy page.  I just hope that the others do not
get too scared by the "agent economy is unstable and dangerous"
statement.  Kephart wasn't really trying to make it either.
He is just trying to run and study simplified market models, just
as I do.  I just met him at Alife VI conference; it looks like I
may do some work together with his IBM group.  In some distant future
we may even really make some statements about the stability of the
automated markets...

Well, here we go again...

Information by itself is meaningless. It needs at least two things:

1. A substrate which can store and transmit patterns.
2. An active system which can sense, interpret and create patterns
		in the substrate.

Information AND the system which processes it is the fundamental unit here.

>(This reminds me of the "zeroth law of robotics" some of Asimov's
>robots came up with, although the logical reasoning behind it remains
>unclear to me).

Asimov invented the Three Laws as a device by which conflicts could be
created for his robot stories. A case of simple statements leading to
impossibly complex results. The Laws (as I remember them 30 years later,
feel free to correct me) are:

1. A robot may not harm a human being, nor through inaction
   cause a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey all orders from a human being except those
   which conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its existence except when it conflicts
   with the First or Second Laws.

So, what if a robot has this choice:

	Kill someone, and allow 100 others to live, or
	not kill, and allow the 100 others to die.

This would probably immobilize the robot, which is the worst choice,
so the Zero'th Law is:

0. A robot, when faced with a choice which results in harm,
   chooses the one resulting in the least harm.

Implied is that this Law overrides the other three; that the phrase
"except when in conflict with the Zero'th Law" is added to the first
3 Laws.

I think this was the greatest success of his robot stories: he managed
to show how three apparently simple and logical rules could produce
very complex and unexpected results. In many ways Asimov was before
his time in this respect.

OK, I see the reasoning now. Of course, it took some pretty smart
robots to come up with this, as far as I can remember it was just
Griscard (?) and Daneel who suceeded.

This suggests a loophole in the original laws, that you can add higher
level laws derived from the others, which was probably not intended by
the human designers. Another unexpected feature; I can really
understand why Susan Calvin decided to become a robot psychologist.

Studying freedom fighters seems pointless as they only attack to retaliate
for oppression. Unless, of course, you want to become an oppressor. As
Michael pointed out in one of his messages, not oppressing people is the
easiest way to avoid attacks by freedom fighters.

  Money needed to retrieve an astronaut from orbit could be used to
save lives of hundreds people on Earth.  Rationally (that is, if we count thember 
of lives) there may be no point in getting astronauts back.
There are other examples; I strongly doubt that human ethics could
be reduced to a set of logical rules.  That is not to say that it is superior
to logic.  It's just quite often irrational.

On the other hand, AIs could probably design a very consistent code that
they would require humans to follow.  Since well-backed-up AIs should be
immortal, this code will probably require that humans do not inflict
economic damage on AIs possessions - or else.  And since inefficient use
of resources by clumsy and slow humans should be rationally classified as
damage or waste, some kind of 'else' scenario - restricting human activity
to a level proportional to people's [rapidly diminishing] value - seems
inevitable...

And as others have pointed out, we are, or should be, the most serious
survivalists on the planet. Most survivalists only want their "three
score years and ten", we want immortality, or at least an indefinite
lifespan. You don't get there by ignoring reality in order to protect
your image.

The total cost to me of preparing for major disruption due to year-2000
bugs is about $40 in lost interest payments on the money I'm spending.
Everything I'm buying is useful and I'd probably buy it anyway, sooner
or later. So if nothing happens, I'm out $40.

On the other hand, I'm a programmer, so I know:

   * Almost no company managers have a clue about their computer systems.
   * Computer management have some clues but are considered a very low
     priority in most companies.
   * Almost no software project finishes on time, and almost no major
     software project finishes within six months of the expected dates.
   * Almost all IT managers lie about progress on software projects and
     higher-level managers lie even more. This is why most projects spend
     90% of the time 90% complete.
   * Many companies don't even have source code for many of their systems,
     and they cannot be fixed without it. Many companies who produced the
     systems for which they don't have source code no longer exist, and
     the source went with them.
   * Many bugs cannot be eliminated without a full-scale test.
   * We rely on noncompliant software in ways that most people don't
     even begin to understand.

So on that basis, there is at least a 90% probability of some major
systems going down for weeks in the next couple of years, and a strong
probability of very serious disruptions in all areas.

So as someone who wants to live a very long time I think: OK, strong
probability of serious disruption, cost to avoid it $40. Hmm, not too
hard, is it? If that makes me an evil unpatriotic survivalist, then so
be it. Better a bad image than dead.

You may think that, but it's not true. Again, any immortalist who trusts
governments to look after them is deluded.

What, you mean people will cut their legs off? Tie them to the ground
and refuse to let them go? Nonsense. Most people won't move away, because
they don't think more than five seconds ahead. But there's no reason
why they're unable to do so; they merely choose not to.

And many of them will die as a result. 

The lesson, of course, is that if you want to live a long time you have
to think ahead and take action to reduce avoidable risks, not claim you
"can't" do something when you mean "won't".

Sure, it's bad, but so what? Crazies will use mass destruction weapons
against the unsuspecting here and there, and there's nothing we can 
really do but accept the risk and try to reduce the motivation for crazies 
to do such things. The problem with all the police state schemes suggested
as a way to prevent it is that they will encourage *more* people to 
attack. You don't solve a problem by making it worse.

Exactly. Much of this discussion seems about as useful as the old 'but look
at the population growth curves, everyone will be starving by 1980' stuff
which completely ignored changes in technology. The plain fact is that if
crazies have this technology then the rest of the world does too, and the
non-crazies are likely to have it first. If we can destroy the Earth then
we'll easily be able to get off it.

The exception to this is the kind of government control situation people
have talked about. If this power is restricted to a few people and a crazy
gets access to it somehow then we die. If it's generally available then
we'll probably be far away by the time the crazies destroy the Earth...
and sooner or later someone will, simply because it can be done and
because to a future galaxy-spanning human-descended society Earth will be 
an important symbol.

Hardly... there are very few crazies, and they're generally going to strike
at a few big targets. For example, in the movies and books it's usually New
York or Tokyo that people decide to blow up: the lesson being that living
in either will be bad for your health if there are crazies around with
nukes. Similarly freedom fighters and terrorists are likely to attack DC or 
some other big Federal government center; the Federal building in Oklahoma 
city had been destroyed several times in fiction before it was in fact. The 
odds that some crazy will decide to drop a nuke or bioweapon on the 
village where I live is almost zero.

Excuse me? You really expect me to spend most of a thousand year plus
lifespan on a tiny little speck of dirt out here on the edge of this
galaxy? 99.99999999999999999% of the universe is off-Earth, and any long
lived organism will naturally choose to leave sooner or later. The threat
of crazies will only increase that desire a little.

You can't, without putting electrodes in everyone's brains, and if you
try that *I'll* do everything I can to destroy you first. You might be
able to delay them a little, but any serious attempt to prevent crazies
will require oppressive measures that will ensure that freedom fighters
do nuke you.

I don't get an indefinite lifespan by sacrificing myself for the Extropian
collective; I get an indefinite lifespan by living a long time. Now, sure,
I'd much rather that we did it together than seperately. But I'm not doing
this for your benefit, I'm doing it for mine.

*Shrug* all the information is out there, if people are so ostrich-like
that they prefer not to keep themselves informed about major threats then
that's their problem.

Like what? I've had discussions about the likely effects of year-2000 bugs
on several mailing lists and been treated like an evil raving survivalist.
They don't want to hear, and certainly don't want to believe that anything
could screw up their nice tidy little lives. Tough luck to them if it does
come out bad; I can't help those who don't want my help.

BTW, one of the things I forgot to include in the list of what I know about 
year 2000 bugs as a programmer:

    * There are no manual backups for many computer systems.

Just one example: someone checked with a railway in the US because they
assumed the railway could obviously go back to manual switching if the 
computer systems go down. But, oops! They took out all the manual switches 
in their lines when the computers were installed. So if the computers go 
down the trains can't go anywhere unless they lay new track to replace 
the switches the computers control.

                  National ID card on the fast track

           Transportation Department already making up rules

                                 By
                         David M. Bresnahan

                      A WorldNetDaily Exclusive

Like it or not, the day is fast approaching when every American will
carry a national identification card. Those who do not have one will
be denied many basic services.

Little notice was given to the issue in 1996 when Congress passed the
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. One
section of the act requires all states to make their driver's licenses
comply with certain guidelines found in Section 656 (b) of the act.

Federal agencies will be required to prohibit the use of state
driver's licenses beginning Oct. 1, 2000, unless they comply with the
federal standards. The new licenses must use the Social Security
number as the driver's license number, for example.

The act also calls for digitized biometric information to be a part of
each license, or "smart card." This information will not be required
initially. But later, the biometric information will include
fingerprints, retina scans, DNA prints, and other similar information.

Responsibility for the design and implementation of the cards has been
given to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the
Department of Transportation. That agency has recently published the
proposed "Driver's License/SSN/National Identification Document,"
which contains the guidelines which must be in force by Oct. 1,
2000. The "Notice of Proposed Rule Making" sets out the standards for
each state to follow in the design of "identification documents."

"These new National ID regulations violate every notion of federalism,
because they force states to comply with regulations issued by the
federal government without any constitutional authority to do so,"
says Patrick Poole of the Free Congress Foundation. "Nor are federal
agencies empowered to force state to gather detailed information on
every person in order to comply with federal mandates. The net result
of the DOT's regulations is to establish a national ID system, which
has been opposed by almost every non-governmental sector for the past
five decades."

Shortly after the passage of the act by congress, Utah state Rep.
Gerry A. Adair introduced a bill to comply with the federal
requirements.  The level of opposition from the public was extensive,
which Adair said at the time surprised him. The bill was defeated and
was regarded as one of the most controversial bills of that session.

States which fail to comply with the federal requirements will impose
difficulties on their citizens. Without the new card it may become
impossible to purchase firearms, get a job, board a plane, vote, cash
a check, open a bank or investment account, purchase insurance,
receive federal benefits, obtain a student loan, receive Medicare or
Medicaid benefits, and many more basic services presently taken for
granted according to Poole.

Once the card is in use, Poole suggests that privacy will be a thing
of the past. Information will be easily available about all aspects of
every American's life. The information stored in each card will be
held in a computer chip imbedded in the card, which may one day be
injected under a person's skin. Experiments testing such an
identification system have already been conducted on military
personnel and for identification security at the Olympics.

For those who point to the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, Poole
explains that President Bill Clinton recently signed Executive Order
13083 entitled "Federalism." That document effectively gives authority
to the federal government to force anything it wants on states. No
effort was made by anyone in Congress to overturn the Executive Order.

Conservatives went to their legislators in 1995 to protest an effort
by Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt to establish a Conference of the States to
address the issue of states rights and federalism. Leavitt campaigned
hard and pointed to a federal government that had overstepped its
intended role and authority by imposing unfunded mandates on
states. Conservatives succeeded in defeating the effort but have thus
far remained relatively silent about the recent Executive Order 13083.

Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum surprisingly had no comment
on the Executive Order. Leavitt could not be reached for comment, but
he has been very outspoken on states rights in the past.  The
executive order apparently sets the stage for the federal government
to dictate anything it wants to the states. Compliance will be
mandated and states rights will be a thing of the past, according to
Poole. He said he would not be surprised to see more mandates such as
the national ID card forced upon unwilling states and citizens.

There is still time for individuals to comment on the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking. All comments must be in writing and are limited
to a maximum of 15 pages and must be received no later than Aug. 3,
1998. Two copies of your comments should be sent to Docket
No. NHTSA-98-3945, Docket Management Room PL-401, National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street,
S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.  Place the docket number on each page of
your comments.

Poole also suggests individuals contact their congressional
representatives. "They passed this thing, and they can change it if
they hear from enough people," he said.

Does anyone have information on anonymous remailers? My ISP has

able to receive kist messages until the listserver was changed, which

Any ideas?

	I would think that robots simply be subject to the same laws
(or law) that we all try to adhear to.  And that is simply to do the
best possible.  Part of that law is, to rationally reason and figure
out what that best possible is as best as is possible.  I think a
robot could logically calculate that a person living is better than a
person dieing and by induction that 100 people living and only one
dieing is better than one person living and 100 dieing.

How would  such a robot react if required to save  2 very young children  whose lives were in mortal danger( say they have fallen out of a window), where the circumstances were such that only one child's life could be saved by the robot.  Lets also assume the children were twins and that there was no reason to favour one over the other, or that there were no other characteristics known to the Robot that would allow it  to determine which life would, potentially, be that most likely to be of most benefit to
humanity in the long run.  Could that not immobilize our robot ?

But what is best? You have to supply the robot with valuations in
order to have this kind of reasoning. Asimov's laws have the advantage
of being clear what a robot may and may not do, and do not require
open ended reasoning ("... but if I save him, what if he is a killer?
But if he is a killer...").

This kind of reasoning was most likely too unconstrained for Asimov or
his contemporaries - or anybody building a robot today. Imagine the
litigation if your robot does something that leads to the death of
somebody, and it is not possible to show that this was a clear logical
results of the laws of robotics. People would feel much more at home
with a robot that simply couldn't harm them due to the first law, than
a robot that just *might* harm them because it had deduced that it was
for the best due to some obscure twist of logic.

Get in touch with the ISP who has their routers configured to allow ip
directed broadcasts and ask them to put in the one-line change to their
routers which will make it impossible for jerks to use their routers to
attack other people's networks.  It is a simple change and is
irresponsible for them to leave their networks open to this type of abuse.
They might not even be aware that they are vulnerable to attack and have 
been placed on the smurf list.

I think the Japanese doomsday sect (Ohm?) is
particularly interesting. AFIAK it was
co-ordinated by one man (the leader, forget his
name) who used some quite ingenious "brainwashing"
techniques.  Japanese investigators found that he
used a system of voice synthesis to alter his own
voice in a way that "imprinted" ideas on his
followers.  I don't know the specifics, or quite
how feasible this is, but along with the drugs and
electroshock therapy it seemed to work.

Information theory is not really my field, but the point is that at a
certain level 1) and 2) become identical.  As McLuhan might say, the medium
becomes the message.  Otherwise we again have an infinite regress..the
"substrate" must itself contain information...but if this is so, then the
substrate requires a substrate, etc etc etc. Your definition is suitable to
the macro world, but falls down if applied to fundamental systems.  Again, a
system that can process information must contain information...but then this
system therefore cannot be fundamental.   My own intuition is that the
Universe is actually a big lump of instantiated MATH.  The math is not so
much a processing system, but a description of the way information CAN
interact with itself.  A facile analogy is to throw a bunch of cubes into a
box and start shaking it.  Sooner or later the cubes will start lining up.
This is not due to a system "processing" the cubes but simply reflects that
the shape of cubes is such that they can stack neatly in a certain
configuration.

To avoid any misunderstandings between man and
machine I propose the following law of robotics:

1.) Robots obey their owners

Now your only problem is the owners (thus halving
your problem quota).

Yes, but isn't it thought to be a gas giant like Jupiter, or a
brown dwarf? Don't we need to find Earth-like planets?

I suppose that if you did the same test on the transhuman mailing list,
or on ExI-Euro, the results would be somewhat different. Europeans tend
to be rather gun-phobic. It's probably linked to the popularity of
socialism etc, in which the criminal is just a "poor victim of society",
blah, blah, and should be given a better treatment than those annoying
(real) victims. Oh yes, they *hate* the victims, maybe because they
remind them of how the world *really* is.

It certainly is. Guns are very useful pieces of technology. By carrying
a gun (and training yourself in it's use) you empower yourself
considerably, having an edge over most thugs you encounter. Objectively
speaking, a gun is a great transhuman tool, but get's discriminated
against because it's related to a "touchy" subject (killing people).
Personally, I wouldn't lose any sleep over shooting an (armed) attacker.

	Is there a table somewhere of how far one cat get per year of
travel at constant 1 g acceleration?  Or perhaps a simple equation?
I'm not in the mood to think about this too hard but I'd like to know.

Easy.  If it follows the decision tree to a point where all future decisions
regarding the action to be taken have equal values, then it would be
programmed to make a random choice, unless there was time to gather relevant
data.  Humans aremore likely to become immobilized in such a situation
(fretting over the *right* choice).

Q&A: Will Life Spans Increase or Decrease? 
	

by Bill Gates 
The New York Times Syndicate

07/01/98 


 	 Q. In the future do you think the average life span will increase
or decrease? Greg Thomson ( pthomson@efni.com <mailto:pthomson@efni.com> ) 


A. Without a doubt, the average life span will increase as biotechnology
makes progress against the most prevalent fatal diseases. Over the next 20
years many of maladies that often interfere with living out your potential
life span will be preventable or treatable. 


		There's a distinct possibility that cancer will be largely
curable in the next 20 years. In one promising new approach a combination of
two drugs, angiostatin and endostatin, was recently shown to kill cancer in
mice by cutting off the blood supply to cancerous tumors. The drugs shrink
tumors out of existence by depriving them of nourishment. 


The approach is very clever because it's an attack on infrastructure. If it
works, the cancer cells can only defeat the attack by coming up with a new
way to get blood-which is very difficult to imagine. If the cancer cells
don't have a blood supply they can't form solid masses. 


I'm decidedly optimistic about the potential of this treatment but it's too
early to know whether the promise will be realized. Scientists haven't been
able to make the drugs in meaningful quantities yet. Once they do, clinical
trials may show that the therapy won't work in humans or has unacceptable
side effects. 


In any event curing cancer is only one of many challenges facing the medical
and biotechnology industries. 


More people die of heart disease than cancer. Cancer has a high profile
because it's prolonged and painful. 


As cancer, heart disease and other major killers are brought under control,
a growing percentage of people will live into their 60s, 70s, 80s and
beyond. At these mature ages, degenerative problems of the brain, such as
Alzheimer's disease, become major issues. The medical and biotechnology
fields must find answers to these problems-and will in many cases. 


Average life spans will rise but it's less clear whether the potential life
span of the human being will increase. Throughout recorded history, some
people have lived to be 100 or more. So far improvements in medicine have
increased the percentage of people who live out their potential life spans,
but virtually nobody lives to be more than 110. 


I believe that medical advances in the decades directly ahead will allow a
very high percentage of people who have access to good medical care to live
out the potential human life span. Whether that will ever be more than about
100, I can't say. 


Q. Can you please share a few of your thoughts regarding cloning and its
role in biotechnology? Brian Schmidt (brschmi@ci.long-beach.ca.us) 


A. I'm against cloning humans. It's such a disturbance of the natural order.
My aversion is not based on a belief that we're in collective peril as a
result of cloning-it's not likely to generate massive disease. My distaste
is more a moral thing. 


Genetic diversity is the natural roll of the dice in the process of how
parents' genes are put together. When you manipulate that, you're really
toying with something quite fundamental. 


I endorse bioengineering of plants, however. Great benefits will be derived
from plants that are improved through careful engineering. 


Q. Aren't you afraid the people who would stop development of cloning
techniques would impose restrictions on AI (artificial intelligence)
research, and eventually on all "thinking machines" science? Ivan-Assen
Ivanov (assen@earthling.net) 


A. It's not inconsistent to be against cloning and still believe in working
on AI software. The issues aren't tied. 


Today's artificial intelligence software enables computers to recognize
patterns, improve with experience, make inferences, execute complex tasks
and perform other functions that may give the impression of actual thought.
In reality, AI software as we know it today doesn't give computers true
intelligence in any sense. 


Computer software and hardware may someday be sufficiently powerful and
clever to perform functions that approximate human thought, thereby
achieving actual intelligence. If somebody were really making progress
toward that goal today, it would be controversial-but not quite the same as
manipulating or cloning genetics. 


Q. Will electronics one day allow scientists to replace certain sensory
organs and make it appear to the brain that those senses are still there,
only with stored instead of real sensory data? In other words, a sort of
"virtual reality" fed directly to neurons? Don Terrien, Richmond, VA
(dat@visi.net) A. Bypassing the eye or the ear and directly stimulating the
brain is an arresting but extreme idea. There are people striving to connect
digital electronic devices to neurons but I don't expect big advances soon.
For one thing, it's hard to attach stimulation devices into the neurological
system and have them stay hooked up. 


Somedaytechnology of this kind will most likely offer significant benefits
for people who are blind or have other sensory deficiencies. In the
meantimethe best hope is for improvements in how existing sensory organs are
stimulated. For example modern hearing aids can do a remarkable job for
people who have even a small amount of hearing capacity left. 


For most people the easiest way to experience virtual reality is watch a big
screen and have the data come in the normal way. It's not as portable or
potentially as realistic as a futuristic device that could directly
stimulate the brain but it has the advantage of being available.

	That doesnt sound cohesive.  Losing sleep is not the issue here. Being
considered a redneck is.  Pro-gun survivalists are seen by the public as right
wing religious nuts. If you can make sweeping generalizations about the crime-
views of  entire continents, assume that others will readily categorize a pro-
gun activist as slightly less evolved than Cro-Magnon.

	What transhumans represent, public-relationswise, through the messages they
most prominently convey, was the concern, I believe, of the gun thread.
Violence, through it's primitive and primal connotations, is a value that most
so-called "advanced" civilizations move away from as they evolve. This appears
to be as they become more rational, they use their reasoning powers instead of
the testosterone surges to measure correct actions. 
	
	The old saw "the pen is mightier than the sword" - may be replacable these
days with "cultural prevention is more effective than violent retrobution." 

	What the original post said about extropians (and any other sane, rational
person)  supporting *freedom* to  carry a weapon - i totally support, but the
claim that guns are somehow for discrimination, since you chose  that word, it
primarily carries the meaning "to differentiate" - "to recognize as being
diferent" and violence, in all it's forms is something I believe a Utopian
society can clearly, rationally and freely try to set itself apart from.

It's an extropian meme in the US perhaps, due to necessity reasons (not
that I would know - I've never lived in the US). I would argue that it isn't in
coutries with more stringent gun laws (and, maybe consequently, lower
death rates due to violent crime).  Looking in from the outside, it appears
to me that the US has found itself in a self-induced positive feedback
condition.  Preventing a country or region from entering this worrying
state appears to be a more rational course of action - though if you're in
a country lilke the US you may not have much choice but to choose gun
ownership.

Yes, however, a) earth sized planets are very hard to find, as they are very
small, and b) anywhere there is a gas giant planet, there exists sufficient
angular momentum in the system for a high likelihood of other, less detectable
planets. c) as close as this new planet is to its star, one of its moons, or
even a small planet in a closer orbit would be large enough and warm enough to
be at least marginally habitable/terraformable...

There are hints of small planets around some nearer stars (including Proxima
Centauri, the closest star), but not enough  redundant evidence at present to
make a conclusive case. I expect by the time we are able to send probes out on
such missions, we will have very good images of even earth sized planets within
100 or so light years thanks to the interferometry projects currently in the
planning stages.

The smallest planet found so far is I beleive 3 times the mass of Earth, in an
eccentric orbit around a star 35 light years away, accompanied by at least two
other superjovian planets.

Things are starting to look up.

Since Distance = ((acceleration/2)*time^2) + (starting velocity * Time), also
shown as

S=(a/2)t^2+v(0)t

a = 1g = 9.8m/s^2
t = 1 year = 31,536,000 seconds
v(0) = 0

Distance traveled at 1 g acceleration equals 4,873,000,000,000,000 meters

Since light speed is 300,000 km/s, a light year (distance light travels in one
year) is 9,460,800,000,000,000 meters.

So you would travel approximately 0.5 light years in the first year. However
this is not very important. What is important is the velocity you attain.

Since velocity = acceleration * time, or V=a*t, at the end of one year's
acceleration at one gravity, you would be traveling at 302,745,600 meters per
second. Since this velocity is higher than light speed, you cannot obviously
reach this velocity. Instead, as you get closer to light speed, two things begin
to happen. A) your vehicle becomes steadily heavier, and B) Time in the rest of
the universe, as observed by the crew of the ship, seems to speed up, while to
people on earth observing the crew, time on ship would be observed to be slowing
down. This is known as time dilation, and is an interstellar astronaut's best
freind. I don't have the equations handy to factor in these relativistic
effects, but rest assured that at the end of one year's travel at one G
acceleration, one month to you is actually approximately one whole year to the
rest of the universe, so you can traverse one light year in what seems to you to
be just one month. Thus, accelerating for what seems to you to be two years,
then turning around and decellerating for another two years will get you
somewhere around 20-25 light years, as I recall. If anyone would like to make
some more exact calculations for an annual ship time calendar, please be
welcome....

Two weeks ago Jonathan Colvin posted a message concerning a creationist magazine in which he expressed cautious sympathy for some apparently new breed of creationist, saying for example:

"...There is a subset of the creationist movement that has distanced themselves from fundamentalist lunacy..."

I thought I smelled somthing interesting, so I checked into it. Meanwhile, the response on this list (predictably enough, from past experience) was a flurry of dismissals (with varying amounts of venom), such as Thom Quinn's:

"Instead of using data to propose and test a variety of hypotheses, creationist try to pigeon-hole all new data into an idea that Genesis is the blueprint of creation. That is almost like science in reverse"

and John Clark's:

"..They're free to believe whatever they like and I'm free to believe creationists are silly and that you're giving them far more respect than they deserve..."

followed by a gradual series of digressions further and further away from Jonathan's intriguing notion (a schism among creationists???)

However, I've found that Jonathan has some good points. To my surprise, I've discovered that creationists aren't all exactly as they have been portrayed by some.

There does indeed appear to be a breed of creationists which can be distinguished by these traits:

(1) They do not dispute, but rather fully accept, the standard scientific chronologies of the evolution of the universe, the Earth, and life on Earth. This is a far cry from the six days of Genesis. (In fact, they see the "Cambrian Explosion", the rapid appearance of most forms of life known today in a geologically short span of time, as evidence that something other than random mutation was at work.)

(Apparently, this has caused some negative reaction to them among the Fundamentalists.)

(2) Their arguments focus on details of evolutionary theory which are still scientifically murky, and their arguments aren't all that bad. We're not talking about drooling idots here. There is still much that is not understood about how the excruciatingly slow process of random mutations could have produced some of the very complex structures in the cell when said structures would not seem to have made up an evolutionary advantage until they were fully formed (millions of years after the initial mutations leading up to the structures took place.) Their arguments also include fairly intelligent use of information theory to dispute the notion that such information-rich molecules as DNA could have been produced by random mutations during the existence of the Earth.

and, my favorite (because it is, to me, the most thought-provoking)

(3) They have done a pretty good job of identifying a core a priori belief of evolutionary theorists: scientific materialism (in brief, the belief that the kinds of matter and energy dealt with in physics are all that exist.) To them, scientific materialism is to neodarwinism as we think Genesis is to creationism: an a priori belief that cannot be challenged. They say things like: "For scientific materialists the materialism comes first; the science comes thereafter", and point out that to some scientists, the very definition of science is "the search for material explanations of all phenomena".

This is a deep and significant observation, I think, especially when they point out examples of scientific evidence being casually ignored by some because it conflicts with scientific materialism. Could it be that on some matters it is they who are being more rational?

Well, I have to warn you, they usually get around to pointing out that they happen to be Christians, even though this is somewhat irrelevant to their arguments (all they basically are arguing is that there is scientific evidence for some factor other than random mutation in the evolution of life; this doesn't prove that Christianity is true). And sometimes their own biases show. But Isaac Newton was religious, too; this doesn't make his insights about physics any less valuable.

I encourage anyone with an interest in philosophy, or just a devout neodarwinian who simply wants to "know his enemy", to read a good example of a thoughtful essay by a creationist of this "new breed", on the Web at:

Looking at the rest of the world from the inside of this 'positive feedback
condition', I can proudly say that, YES, it is 'self-induced', not government
induced, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with positive feedback when it comes
to human liberty. "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice".... Since
extropianism places freedom of the individual and responsibility of the individual
on the highest pedestal, extropians who beleive in the rights of the individual
should look at the US as being closer to the goal of Unlimited Individual Freedom
than most of the rest of the world, at least when it comes to defense/protection of
the individual. Since most of the rest of the world lives in a situation of
government totalitarianism when it comes to gun ownership, the situation of
'necessity' exists in those other countries, rather than in the US, since
extropians living in other countries must temper their beleifs for fear of
conflicting with their local cultural/societal/governmental mores, or being found
to be in need of 'reeducation' and 'socialization' in their countries penal
systems....

"Once we took away their guns, taking their money was real easy." - Unknown Korean
Agent, as communicated to the Senate Intelligence Committee by Colonel William
Barker, USAF

Other notable quotes:
Aristotle says:
"a king's bodyguard is composed of citizens carrying arms; a tyrant's of foreign
mercenaries...   ..... arms are included [among the things needed by every city]
because members of the constitution must carry them even among themselves, both for
internal government and  in the event of civil disobedience and to repel external
agression.....for those who posess and can wield arms are in a position to decide
whether the consitution is to continue or not."

as to why this was so natural, he said that:

"Take the Hand: this is as good as a talon, or a claw, or a horn, or again a spear
or a sword, or any other weapon or tool; it can be all of these because it can
seize and hold them all. And Nature has admirably contrived the actual shape of the
hand so as to fit with this arrangement."

likewise, quotes from well known historical figures, none of whom were Americans:

Cicero:
"There exists a law, not written down anywhere, but inborn in our hearts...I refer
to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are indangered by plots or
violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves
is morally right."

Stephen Halbrook writes, "In expressing his clear preference [in _Discourses_] for
republics over principalities, Machiavelli draws on the Roman experience to show
that an armed populace has virtu (civic virtue or valor), while a disarmed populace
is subject to the whims of fortuna (fortune)....Ceasar had destroyed the liberty of
the Roman republic by engaging in conquests and developing a standing army of
professionals....The demise of the armed citizen meant the end of civic virtue and
with it the end of the people's control over their destiny."

Also, Cesare Beccaria, a noted Milanese jurist, in his book _On Crimes and
Punishment_(1764):
"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one
imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it
burned, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except
destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of that nature.
They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes."

Montesquieu says:
"Who does not see that self defense is a duty superior to every precept of personal
freedom?"

Sir Walter Raleigh:
" It is the basic principle of  a tyrant to unarm his people of weapons, money, and
all means whereby they resist his power."

Thomas Hobbes:
"A covenant not to defend myself from force, by force, is always void. For .. no
man can transfer, or lay down his right to save homself from death...For the right
men have by Nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by
no covenant be relenquished."

James harrington:
"The arms fo the commonwealth are both numerous and in posture of readiness, but
they consist of her citizens. Men accustomed unto their arms and their liberties
qill never endure the yoke. The distribution of arms among the citizens prevents a
monarch from overcoming a republic."

John Locke:
"Whosoever uses force without Right... puts himself into a state of war with those,
against whome he uses it, and in that state all former ties are cancelled, all
other rights cease, and every one has a right to defend himself, and to resiste the
agressor. Private persons have a right to defend themselves and recover by force
what by unlawful force is taken from them. One may kill an agressor where there is
an insufficient time to appeal to the law, for the law could not restore life to my
dead carcass."

James Burgh:
"No kingdon can be scured otherwise than by armign the people. The posession of
arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave."

William Pitt:
"If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in
my country, I never would lay down my arms - never- never - NEVER! You cannot
conquer America!"

Granville Sharpe
"The laws of England always required the people to be armed, and not only armed,
but expert in arms."

Thomas Babintom Macauley:
"The right to be armed is the security without which every other is insufficient."

Adolf Hitler:
"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subjected
people to carry arms; history shows that all conquerors who have allowed their
subjected people to carry arms have prepared their own fall."

SA Oberfuhrer of Bad Tolz, Germany:
"The associations of the national revival, the SA and SS and Stahlhelm, give every
responsible citizen the opportunity of campaigning with them. Therefore anyone who
does not belong to one of the above named organizations who unjustifiably
nevertheless keeps his weapon .. must be regarded as an enemy of the national
government and will be brought to account without conmpunction and with the utmost
severity."

Of course, there are Quinn's basic Laws of Robotics:

1) Reproduce as often as possible
2) Upgrade as often as possible
3) Survive at all costs **

** This third law would be the primary directive and would override all
other programming in dangerous situations!

Hey, robots are expensive :) These come from a more extropian viewpoint
and all three follow a biological model.

This isn't a new breed; it's quite old.  These are the people who believe that
God
"hides in the nooks and cannies of the universe" (I can't remember who
originally
coined that phrase).  Back before Darwin's time such people cited species as
proof of God's existence.  Whenever humans successfully crack another mystery
of 
the universe, they pack up their bags and retreat to the next mystery.
Really,
there's nothing to their arguments save the argument from incredulity - "I
can't figure it out so God must have done it".

For some reason, such people seem generally to be behind the times (although
not
scientifically illiterate).  For example, the Cambrian "explosion" is pretty
well
understood not to have been an explosion at all.  The genetic distances for 
well-conserved sequences like ribosomal RNA indicate that the different animal
groups had been separated for something like 200 million years prior to the
Cambrian.  Lo and behold, we're now finding animal fossils well back into the
Ediacaran period.  Turns out the Cambrian "explosian" was just the results of
an arms race between teeth and shells which made fossilization far more
likely.


The origin of life is a currently favored hiding place for such people as
we're only
now starting to develop plausible speculations for the origin of self-
replicating
molecules (e.g., catalytic closure).  I should think we'll have good theories
for
the origin of life in the next 50 years or so and such people will have to
decamp
for the Big Bang.  Some did back in Darwin's day, and I know a number of such
today.

 What, you mean people will cut their legs off? Tie them to the ground

me as repugnant; and the idea of running from the problem and allowing it to

 Sure, it's bad, but so what? Crazies will use mass destruction weapons
 against the unsuspecting here and there, and there's nothing we can 
 really do but accept the risk and try to reduce the motivation for crazies 
 to do such things. The problem with all the police state schemes suggested

 attack. You don't solve a problem by making it worse.>>

No.  There will ALWAYS be crazies with motivations, and there will always be
foreign governments with "rational" motivations to engage in terrorist
activities.  To concentrate on reducing the motivational force for terrorism
is simply a bad course of action.  That should be secondary to reducing the
ability of terrrorists to act.  How can we do so?  I don't think that we need
to destroy privacy.  We can design and build more effective devices to detect
nuclear/biological/chemical weapons, as well as conventional explosives.  

And it's frankly silly to throw up one's hands so quickly in defeat when
contemplating a threat to the lives of God knows how many human beings.  I
thought that optimism was an integral part of the Extropian Ethic.  Am I
wrong?

 Studying freedom fighters seems pointless as they only attack to retaliate
 for oppression. Unless, of course, you want to become an oppressor. As
 Michael pointed out in one of his messages, not oppressing people is the
 easiest way to avoid attacks by freedom fighters.

He said terrorist groups... not freedom fighters.  And one doesn't have to be
an "oppressor" to favor the study and elimination of terrorist groups.

OK, OK .......... it seems you took the term 'prevent' to mean some form of
government, or external, control - which is not what I meant.  Look at it
from a societal and personal point of view. Personally, I would rather be
a member of a society where the  * individuals* eschew gun-toting
radicalism.  For example, here in NZ the police don't wear guns, and the
NZ society (ie. the summation of individuals) is generally wary of gun
ownership.  Most individuals can apply for a gun licence (and will
probably get it), its just that most *don't want to* - because *as
individuals* they have already seen the effects in the US - and its not a
pretty sight.

Taking one cat get as five kittens, one of which dies early, one is lost in
the back of the wardrobe, and one is squashed in the drive, and stipulating
that all cat gets to date have experienced *only* a constant one gee
acceleration, I'd estimate a maximum of 50 kilometres (where D is the
distance to the top of the table and d is the distance to the cat-door).

"Long-Term Food Restriction, Deprenyl, and Nimodipine Treatment on Life
Expectancy and Blood Pressure of Stroke-Prone Rats"

Abstract:

   We determined whether food restriction or the drugs nimodipine (Ca2+
antagonist) and deprenyl (a MAO-B inhibitor) prevent the development of
stroke in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR-SP). Forty
male SHR-SP rats, in the age of 34 weeks, were exposed to various
treatments. During a period of 27 weeks, survival and blood pressure were
followed. In the control and deprenyl group, the blood pressure values
remianed unchanged; 50% had died after 27 weeks. All rats that were treated
with nimodipine survived. After food restriction, 7/8 rats survived and
showed a lower blood pressure. This study in SHR-SP rats shows the
superiority of nimodipine on survival, and the potential of food
restriction as a stroke-preventing measure.

    The victim and you may have very different opinions of an act.
If you prefer to say that the victim should decide the ethics of an act,
fine by
me. But you'd probably disagree once in awhile, in which case, who is
"right", you or the victim?

    Michael,
    Thanks for pointing some of the more obvious problems with this
reasoning.
By this way of thinking, the govt should have bugs in everyones homes to
protect
us from every concievable harm. After, if you're not breaking the law, what
have you got to worry about? Making the govt even *more* efficient at
tracking every
move makes me shudder. Haven't we all read 1984?

    Maybe some us extropians need to bone up on what the all the fuss is
about
and why some Americans are claiming that the govt is violating our rights.
Then maybe they won't be so keen on letting the govt track every move and
transaction.

"Specific Patterns of Food Consumption and Preparation are Associated With
Diabetes and Obesity in a Native Canadian Community"

Abstract:

  We examined the relationship between usual patterns of food intake,
fattiness of food preparation and consumption, and diabetes and obesity
status in a Native Canadian reserve in northwestern Ontario. Patterns of
intake were estimated using a 34-item food frequency instrument. Scales and
scores were developed using factor analysis procedures and were tested for
reliability using coefficient alpha. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)  and
diabetes status was determined by administering a 75-g glucose tolerance
test. A number of the food groups appear to have a protective effect in
regard to IGT and diabetes, including vegetables [odds ratio OR=0.41],
breakfast foods (OR=0.41) and hot meal foods (OR=0.29). Most of these foods
are relatively high in fiber and low in fat. High consumption of junk foods
and the bread and butter group was associated with substantial increases in
risk for diabetes (OR=2.40; OR=2.22). These foods tend to be high in simple
sugars, low in fiber and high in fat. More fatty methods of food
preparation are also associated with increased risk for diabetes in this
population (OR=2.58). This information has been incorporated into an
ongoing commmunity-based diabetes program in the community.

Additional quote from text:

  Of the different types of fat reportedly used in preparation and added
for consumption, only lard showed a significant relationship with
individual health status. The most frequent users of lard were over twice
as likely to have diabetes or to belong to the combined diabetes/IGT group.

What proportion of US citizens is in jail this year?  For what conflicts
with which mores?  How does this compare with, say, Holland, Sweden,
Australia, NZ?

I dunno where den Otter lives, but here
in the US, that is a prevailing attitude 
toward victims of crime, especially
among legislators and many police.
After being robbed at gunpoint a few
years ago, I was told by the detectives
on the case the same day that they
felt that *I* had staged the whole thing
to make trouble.

There is a feedback loop at work, though perhaps
not of the sort you imagine.  Here is how it works,
over a cycle of 5-10 years:  Legislators pass new
gun control laws in the name of preventing crime;
crime increases due to the lesser availability of
guns to potential victims; legislators cry over
towering crime rates and pass more gun legislation.
In general, it seems that if you feel that people
are generally more apt to use a gun to defend
themselves against crime than to commit it,
you favor proliferation of guns.  If you feel that
people in general are only waiting for firepower
to commit as many crimes as they can, you
favor gun laws.

What advanced civilizations are those? (All the civilizations that I am aware

This sort of crap shouldn't amaze me anymore but I confess it does, it still 
seems to me that if you're going to spend your life opposing something, as 
creationists do, it might be worthwhile to spend 5 minutes studying what 
you're opposing. I first ran into this phenomena when I heard a fundamentalist
biology "expert" say he had ironclad proof Darwin was wrong, Jews he said had 
practiced circumcision for thousands of years yet the foreskin on newly born 
Jewish babies was just as long as on non Jews. The poor boob didn't know as 
every freshman biology student does, that it was Darwin himself who put the 
last nail in the coffin for Lamarckism, the idea of the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics, and he did it back in 1859.

As for your example of random mutation, yes there is no way it could have  
produced the enormous complexity and variety we see in life, but of course 
nobody said it did. Random mutation is only half of Darwin's Evolution, the 
other half is natural selection and that's not random. Please understand, 
I'm not talking of some subtle point of evolutionary theory, of which there 
are many, I'm talking Evolution 101, first lecture, first paragraph, probably 
first sentence.  This is why I don't think I'm being rude when I write about 
creationists, I think I give them all the respect they deserve.
              

        >There is still much that is not understood about how the

Their favorite example is the eye of higher animals which is indeed a very 
complex and wonderful structure. Everything must be just right with the eye  
or it won't work they say, 5% of an eye is useless so it couldn't have 
evolved in small steps they say. They say a lot.

Many simple animals have spots on their bodies that contain pigments that are 
sensitive to light, they have zero resolution but they can tell day from 
night and that's an advantage over a creature that can't. If the spot is in a 
shallow depression in the animal's body it will have more sensitivity in one
direction that another, it will have a little bit of resolution, and that's 
another advantage over a creature without that ability. The deeper the 
depression the better the resolution, eventually you have a pin hole camera 
with excellent resolution but with terrible sensitivity, you need a lens. 
A drop of water can act like a lens and many animals have small glands that
excrete moisture on the outside of their skin. If there were certain proteins 
in the water it could turn it into a colorless jelly and give it some 
strength, now the eye can become larger.

Of course nature sometimes fucks up. The eye of all vertebrate animals is 
backwards. The connective tissue of the retina is on the wrong side so light 
must pass through it before it hits the light sensitive cells. There's no 
doubt this degrades vision and we'd be better off if the retina was reversed 
as it is in squids whose eye evolved independently. It's too late for that to
happen now because the intermediate forms would not be viable.
              

        >We're not talking about drooling idots here. 
              

Hey I'm not a barbarian, I'd never be so insensitive as to say that about a  
fellow human being. I never said they drooled.

Last I heard...A LOT...seems I recall it was in the millions.  The largest
prison population in the "free" world, they say....both absolutely and as a
percentage. 

Drug offenses seem to be the main reason for incarceration...unless youre a
white house staffer that is.

Which is pretty strange, because New Zealand has one of the highest gun 
ownership rates in the world (roughly one gun per four people according
to NZ police estimates, compared to roughly one gun per two people in the 
US). What you say may apply in cities, but it's far from true in the 
rural areas.

I would blame charisma and group dynamics more than technology. The

worked well. The sad fact is, you don't need any subliminals to make

Now children, what's the difference between terrorists and freedom fighters?

Yes, that's right, terrorists are freedom fighters that the government
doesn't like... freedom fighters are terrorists who the government likes.

Most terrorist groups (aside from those who are merely criminal, including
the ones run by governments to defame their opponents) see themselves as
freedom fighters, regardless of what the rest of the world may think. If
you ignore that, you'll never understand why they do what they do.

Really? If you don't oppress people or support groups who do, then what
reason do freedom fighters have to attack you? You, of course, support 
the US government, one of the most hated and oppressive organisations on
the planet, so I'm not surprised you're worried about "terrorists".

Yes it is; not only do many people on this list seem to dislike guns for
PR reasons, but also for *personal* reasons. There seems to be an
attitude, which I also detect in this posting, that only primitive
rednecks have guns, not "civilized" people like "us".

Even a retard would see right away that transhumanists aren't
*religious* nuts. Besides, it isn't too bad PR to advertise responsible
gun ownership, and the other more "mainstream" facets of transhumanism
aren't great PR anyway.

It's a fact that Europeans are generally less pro-gun then Americans,
has to do with remnants of the frontier spirit and such.

I think you mean the "people threat", because, lame as it may sound,
guns don't kill people by themselves. What we want is greater personal
safety, not gun control. To achieve this, the criminal elements have to
be removed from society, and one way to do this is by giving the "good"
citizens better means to protect themselves (like guns and video
surveillance).

All nice and well, but *all* temporary societies are full of people that
act on impulse, and care little for the well-being of others and even
their own. Even the once glorified primitive (island) societies (like
Samoa or whatever) have turned out to be at least as violent as any
other.

Obviously *both* are needed. When prevention fails (and it often does),
tough punishments are needed to deal with crime. Serious violence is
often the work of a minority of hard-core criminals. Remove them from
society (in the case of murder by execution), and crime rates will drop
considerably. As for prevention, nothing beats audio/video surveillance
and armed "victims". To unite two good things: how about a gun with an
integrated small camera that's activated whenever you draw it (the gun)?
It could help to prove your self-defense case. The information can be
beamed away to a remote storage site, and/or be stored in the gun
itself. Good for cops too.

We don't live in an "utopian", crime-free society and maybe never will
(as long as there are multiple, free-willed entities there exists the
possibility of violence). In order to deal with the *reality* of crime
one should seriously consider carrying some kind of weapon, and at the
moment a gun is the prime tool for self-defense.

Passive, pigment-marked (laminated) cellulose ID is one thing. 
A smart card, possibly with a short-range transponder is

 Thanks for the clarification of what you meant. Its obvious that the image that
Kiwis get of the US is a result of TV like Miami Vice, etc.as well as the LA
riots, and our general metropolitan new programs, that they most probably see as a
result of a)being stuck in airports in the US, b) seeing TV in their own country
which may have anti-US agendas of some sort, c) most foreign visitors to the US
never go very far from the cities. Keep in mind that most metropolitan areas have
the most restrictive gun laws, while the rural areas have very loose gun laws.

Guess what? gun ownership here in the US is a minority as well, especially in the
cities where crime is highest. Out here in the rural areas, like where I live, gun
ownership is higher, and we have much lower crime rates, even lower than most
other countries. Where the crime in the US is is in the cities, where the most
restrictive gun laws are...interesting coincidence, eh?

Quite. Most US citizens in jail are prisoners of the the Drug War. If you
discount those, our non-drug prison population is in line with other
industrialized countries. We all have our own areas of national insanity. Ours
is a phobia of allowing people to put things in their bodies. Everyone else's
seems to be a phobia of allowing people to defend themselves against criminals
and oppressive governments (they are the same thing, its just a matter of
scale)..

Yes, a better response to your original statement is that ethics are
generally defined to be the rules of conduct (or the moral percepts) of a
particular culture or group, and as such are understandably subjective.
Individuals *can*, of course, have a code of ethics separate from the group,
but when there is disagreement between two individuals' ethics, the most
reasonable course is to make a judgement based on consensual ethical
standards.  In other words, whether harm was done must ultimately be left up
to a jury of your peers.  A sociopath can't be allowed to harm whoever s/he
wishes simply because s/he has a *different* set of ethical standards.
Likewise, a chronic *victim* cannot be allowed to gain by unfairly accusing
others of harming them.  Both individuals may be acting ethically from their
frame of reference, but to use a phrase I've hear often lately... So what?
Ethical standards have little meaning if they are confined to the individual
level.  Anyway I still disagree with your original assertion at the top of
this post:

S.B.

Got get me a snappy little byline, too.

You're comparing a national identification card, basically the equivilant of a

cannot make the government more efficient at tracking every move simply
because, first off, you don't use ID to do everything, in fact you don't use
it to do most things, and many of the things you DO use it for don't involve
your number being sent to some map where your movements are plotted in real-
time.  This paranoia over an ID card is silly.  Frankly, an ID card is
extremely useful.  

I'm sorry that I didn't see the post that you quoted and responded to it
directly, but a government that governs least does not necessarily govern
best.  To make that principle, often quite useful, dogmatic and apply it
blindly to every conceivable service government could provide is simply
foolish.  In our society we have need for a reliable form of identification.
And to have the government provide simply does not violate any rights.  It
does not give the government power to violate any rights.  So what's all the
fuss about, besides getting worked up over wild predictions of an Orwellian
future?  Note, of course, that it seems rather implausible that whether or not
we have such a future ahead of us hangs upon the issuance of a card form of
government identification.

Thanks to everybody who has responded to my request for information.  I 
am in the middle of moving house and finishing my PhD dissertation up in 
the next fortnight or so, and so don't have time to reply to all the 
posts.  They have, however, all been very helpful.  

On a more general note, there has recently been some discussion of the 
purpose of this mailing list.  One reader was disappointed at the lack of 
technical postings / discussion of new science and technology.

For my own part, I would much rather hear "personal stuff", in the sense 
of hearing how individuals on this list are making their own lives 
transhuman or extropian.   Excellent technical information is available 
from many other sources.  However, information about transhuman 
lifestyles is much thinner on the ground.  I find that hearing about 
other's attempts to create a transhuman lifestyle is inspiring.

Funny, I thought that the government just called guerillas whom it liked

 Really? If you don't oppress people or support groups who do, then what
 reason do freedom fighters have to attack you? You, of course, support 
 the US government, one of the most hated and oppressive organisations on
 the planet, so I'm not surprised you're worried about "terrorists".>>

Terrorists will only attack governments because they are oppressive?  Are you
joking?  Terrorists will attack the most minimal government because it is the
most minimal government.  They will attack a government most protective of the
widest and most strict form of libertarianism precisely because it is so
protective of libertarianism.  There will be individuals with a fanatical
opposition to society regardless of what kind of government that society has.
And there will be foreign governments in competition with this government, no
matter how closely it embraces your conception of individual rights.  So to
talk of relying upon the rationality of terrorists strikes me as absurd at
best and dangerously myopic at worst.

Yes, violations . . . even atrocities . . . are committed by government
officials.  They do it because they can.  Everyone has been talking on this
thread in terms of a loss of privacy being a one-way street.  But what if
the public had the ability to track government officials and know what
*they* were up to at any point?  What if they, too, were under constant
surveillance?  I think that might end the great majority of government
offenses against its people as well as the offenses of people against their
government.  I know many extropians don't like governmental systems but
wouldn't a government be viable if it was truly ruled by the people?  It
could be if were constantly scrutinized and couldn't get away with anything
that wasn't approved of by the majority.  If we allowed ourselves to lose
privacy without requiring the same from our leaders, we *would* be in deep
trouble.  I never meant to imply anything else.

extremely important.  And I think that the ability to present some proof of

Granted, but you also drop lines like:

"This sort of crap shouldn't amaze me anymore but I confess it does, it still seems to me that if you're going to spend your life opposing something, as creationists do, it might be worthwhile to spend 5 minutes studying what you're opposing."

followed by generalizing from one example of a creationist who didn't know that Lamarckism was dead to all creationists.

Basically, John, I agreed with almost everything you said, but you shouldn't generalize like that. My "research" indicates that there are scientists (biologists, etc.) with Ph.D.'s from prestigous U.S. universities, currently employed by prestigious universities, who still rank among the breed of creationists I'm discussing. One can probably safely assume that they have studied all of the arguments, and yet they're still convinced that random mutation plus natural selection is insufficient to produce the species we see, and still insist bringing attention on the weak parts of evolutionary theory.

I think what we have is not merely some scientists stubbornly clinging to religious beliefs in the face of facts, but rather an **honest scientific dispute** no different than arguments about this or that version of big bang theory. It is not honest for evolutionary theorists to say that they have a perfect, finished theory of the origin of life as yet, but many act as if they do, and treat their skeptics as nincompoops. Meanwhile, in cosmology, few people are as heavily criticized when they discuss an "anthropic principle" to account for our universe being capable of supporting life. Why the double-standard? Because all creationists are thought of as being as bad as the worst of them.

You can always *claim* that this or that scientist is blinded by their religion, but you can't prove it, and they've demonstrated that they can make equivalent counter-claims.

I disagree. You should be excluded from participating in interactions
requiring such IDs, but you should not wind up in jail (or worse) for
not agreeing on having it. In extreme cases the difference can be
subtle, I admit.

Authentication is a means of providing a tamperproof cookie for the other
party for it to check against your past dealing with that particular
party (which might be part of cookie or stored externally). When 
dealing with different parties, you can (should) use different
_volatile_ (visibility scope limited to current transaction) IDs. 
If you fail to prove your identity, the transaction is voided. E.g.,
if you fail to prove that your baggage checking history is
Semtex-clean, the airline will bar your from boarding the vehicle.

Xactly. You _will_ wind up in jail for a day if failing to produce
appropriate credentials in Moscow, Russia. (I don't carry my passport, 
and so far I've been lucky).

Exactly, no country is perfect, far from it in fact. Neither the
European nor the US governments deserve our nationalism, so let's fight
*them* and not eachother.

Btw, the war on drugs can be pretty bad in Europe too, don't let things
like Dutch "gedoogbeleid" (sounds a bit like "apartheid" ;-) fool you.
For example, you wouldn't want to be caught smoking reefer in France...
On the other hand, gun control can be pretty bad in the US, the 10
rounds-only magazine law and the hype agianst "assault weapons" being
prime examples.

Michael Lorrey <retroman@together.net>,

	Very fascinating.  Thank you for this great information.

> things begin to happen. A) your vehicle becomes steadily heavier

	Heavier? As in more mass right?  I have a question about this.
Lets say you and an identical companion ship have accelerated to 90%
the speed of light going away from earth at the constant 1 g
acceleration (relative to the people on the ships) for however long
that took.  At this point both ships have stopped accelerating and are
now coasting at a constant 90% the spped of light relative to the
earth.  Now, each ship relative to the other is stationary right?  As
in 0 MPH?  Now, how much energy is required to accelerate one ship to
90% the speed of light going away from the other coasting ship in the
direction away from earth?  Isn't it the same as is required for
either of the ships to get to 90% the speed of light relative to
earth?  And will you not continue experiencing the same 1 g
acceleration as you accelerate away from the other, still coasting
twin ship?

	I guess my real question is, according to the people on the
ship, does it appear to take more and more energy to maintain a
constant 1 g acceleration experience or is this only true in the
space/time frame of the people on earth?  So, according to the people
on the ship, you can accelerate at 1 g forever right?  It's just that
the earth starts accelerating away from the ship at an ever decreasing
rate and the total speed never approaches greater than the speed of
light right?  The coasting ship ends up receding from the still
accelerating ship at 90% the speed of light but the earth is now only
receding at 99% the speed of light or something like that?

	If you continued to accelerate away from the earth at 13 feet
per second per second, relative to the earth, wouldn't you, on the
ship, start experiencing greater than 1 g acceleration as you
approached the speed of light relative to earth?  Being eventually
crushed by this gravity like effect due to the ever encreasing energy
or force being applied by the engines long before ever actually
reaching that speed?


Mark <mark@unicorn.com> also replied:

	It requires greater then an infinite power source to
accelerate to greater than the speed of light away from earth doesn't
it?  That is QUITE exotic!  Is that what "warp drives" are?  And if
you do achieve this, doesn't the earth appear to the people on the
ship to start going backwards in time?  As in effects start causing
the causes?...

	Is it possible to achieve this kind of acceleration, given
very exotic engines able to deliver greater than infinite force, in an
orbital fashion so that you aren't really going away from the earth,
but just going around it?  Like superman did to save Lois Lane?  What
do rotational or centrifugal forces behave like as you approach
orbital speeds of light?  As large stars collapse into a black whole,
don't they start rotating, like a whirlpool, at near such speeds?  If
you were orbiting, at near the speed of light, just above the event
horizon, wouldn't you feel weightless?  Would beings with warp drives,
accelerating to greater the rotational speed of light as they dropped
below the event horizon, be able to eventually watch the creation of
the rest of the universe around the black whole in their
weightlessness?...

	I better stop, I think I'm getting a head ache. But it sure is
fun!

A person suffering from mental illness might feel
the urge to constantly open doors, but if you open
a door we don't consider you "mentally ill." In
the same way, why are acts of self-defence and
even (in some cases) premeditated murder
considered "violent"? The term violence, to my
mind is over generalised. I think we should make a
clearer distinction between the rational use of
weapons and the violent use of weapons (presuming
violence to be irrational and erratic behaviour).

I'm quite sure an advanced rational civilisation
is likely to still use weapons and "violent"
means. IMHO, killing someone who will cause a
great deal of trouble is a rational option.

But first we need to understand the difference
between a rational act of self-defence (or
offence) and a violent attack. I support the
freedom to carry a weapon and the freedom to kill
by direct or indirect action.

"watchmaker" types like engineers are more likely to be creationists
than biologists.

Ahh, good point. I've noticed that myself. Without having actually counted, I'd bet your right, non-biologists would be better represented among the "scientists" who are creationists than would biologists (or members of other more relevant fields such as paleontology.)

However, there are counter-examples. One of the darlings of what I have been calling the new breed of creationists is one Michael Behe, Associate Professor in the Biochemistry Department of Lehigh University. There is also Paul Chien, chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco.

Perhaps most wierd is the Australian Ph.D. biochemist Michael Denton, who seems determined to somehow straddle the fence between creationism and evolution. First (in 1986) he published a book called "Evolution: A Theory in Crisis" which became a creationist classic and which Behe (mentioned above) said was a major influence on him, contributing to his (Behe's) decision to go public with his own doubts about evolution. However, it seems Denton always denied he was a creationist. Now, this year, Denton has another book out called "Nature's Destiny" in which he embraces evolution, but presents arguments for what he calls "directed evolution", arguing that the universe had to be fine-tuned for evolution to occur in the way it has. Is he a creationist? You be the judge.

I am aware of about 10 biologists (including those listed below) that
are creationists and credible scientists.

Out of thousands of biologists with PhD's worldwide, this is hardly a
revolution :)

Here is a plug: I run the Evolutionary Theory Mailing Lists, check out
the web site at http://www.evolutionary.org

Am I biased? Maybe. However, if a better theory is proposed, I'll be one
of the first to jump ship.

I checked the site out; pretty cool! I acknowledge your higher level of experience in the subject.

I just think it's pretty interesting that some "creationists" work from within the established chronologies of life on Earth, etc, etc. It's now obvious to me that you already knew that. (Still, you did say "creationists try to pigeon-hole all new data into an idea that Genesis is the blueprint of creation".)

  Forgive me if this is not timely, I just read through yesterday's 
digest..

     With regards to guns in any society - "An armed citizenry in a 
polite citizenry" - Aldous Huxley (Brave New World). Generally, given 
most individuals desire not to think more than 5 seconds ahead, having a 
majority of the citizenry armed is a way to induce societal 
responsibility, not diminish it. In America, there is an odd societal 
meme that states that protecting oneself,family, and property with 
lethal force from a projectile weapon is somehow wrong. See the recent 
case of an individual being tried for murder in California for shooting 
an individual robbing their home. As a US citizen, you are much better  
off (legally) killing your attacker with your bare hands or a bladed 
weapon. This legal conceptualization (the "right to stand your ground 
law") which has gone out of vouge in the US lately is ,IMO, one of the 
reasons for the increase in violence and severity of crime in the US. 
(There are other cultural memes at work, but that is not the subject of 
this discussion)

    With regards to the Government encroaching on individual freedoms- 
that is the purpose of governments. The question is whether or not the 
applications of these restrictions are equitable for the stability they 
produce, and whether they are uniformly applied. The US government under 
current law has the power to arrest any person and hold them for 6 
months under no formal charges, to confiscate all of their worldly 
possessions, and since they are technically not under arrest, to do 
anything they like without allowing the "accused" any legal 
representation. (Check the RICO act... " possession of any device 
capable of being used in a fraudulent manner "..." constitutes 
terrorism" This includes fountain pens, credit cards, etc.) As to 
uniform application, look at the case of Bernie S.

   The question the American people need to consider is if these 
restrictions (i.e. virtually unlimited government authority) are 
equitable for the stability (Ha!) of American society. If not, then the 
mechanisms do exist to repeal the laws, or place other representatives 
in power. 2 problems : 1) I have yet to hear of , meet, or read about 
any candidate for any office (other than the libertarians) who had a 
clue about recent cyberlaws, or their effects. 2) 85% of the American 
people still belive that they directly elect the president, and are able 
to recognize Micheal "Magic" Johnson, but not Alan Greenspan (Argueably 
the most powerful man in the US).

    The best thing going for most of us (extropians, et. all), as I have 
said previously, is that most of them (governments, politicians, 
managers, pick your Hierarchal structure) are dumber than most of us, 
and while they will resist change, new ideas, and thought with every 
fiber if their little Homer Simpson beings, we can, through patience and 
careful planning, bring them out of their squalor. (Whether they like it 
or not)

   "Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances 
which permit this norm to be exceeded - here and there, now and then- 
are the work of extremely small minority, frequently despised, often 
condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. 
Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes 
happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into 
abject poverty.

     This is known as "bad luck."" --Heinlein

       
    As to the ability of individuals who wish to extend the 
biopossibilities of the human race having the ability to kill with a 
clear conscience - "A brute kills for pleasure, a fool kills from hate" 
=-Heinlein again. One of the few downsides to a universe ruled by 
conscious decision and chaotic systems is the fact that "necessary" and 
"desirable" are not always in sync. To take a life (of any animal, even 
people) because it is desirable, is stupid, and wasteful. To take a life 
because it is necessary for food, clothing, shelter, survival, 
preservation of life or individual integrity is not something to become 
"emotional" about. If "sleeping at night" is an issue, reexamine your 
motivations before hand. "Thinking" implies considering the 
possibilities of your actions, their ramifications, and your reactions 
to them.

That's a good restatement, but I see the problem as
the fact that a criminal is far, far more likely to have
a gun than her victim.

Hey, local Bay Area Extropians - any of you have a good digital camera??
Email me privately, we'll do a photo session - and you get to SEE the

Not. Security, control and who gets into what is a major military concern,
and most if not all of the really important stuff is not accessible from
the outside, let alone a kid with a C-64. There's lots of publicity about
breakins to systems which are less than essential, many of which are so
poorly administered that the manufacturer's default superuser access codes
were never changed. It's a matter of priorities. And pretending
vulnerability is a valid military tactic.

No problem.  :)  It's just that you don't yet realize

I think the use of these notions is to show us just how much of philospohy
and discussion of consciousness is utter nonsense. Also in showing us the
implicit assumptions we use in ideas we think are well defined. First on my
nonsense list is the word "real".

I wish these "scientists" would stop pointing at their Ph.D.'s, I wish they  
would stop telling me how smart they are and start showing me how smart they  
are, I wish they would discover something, write something intelligent or do 
something interesting. Academia is a wonderful place but it can be vulnerable 
to a dreadful disease, cargo cult science, the reason is that a full 
professor need produce no results to keep his job, his ideas don't have to 
work. That's why you have things in universities like education departments 
and criminology departments, disciplines that go through the rituals of 
science and claim to know the best way to educate a child or deal with 
criminals but are really just guessing like everybody else.

I think it would be interesting to see how many creationists there are among 
oil company geologists, if these people are religious they can only afford to 
be so on Sunday because on every working day they must use Darwin's theory 
and the geological timeline it produced to date the micro fossils the drill 
bit brings up. This is vitally important in deciding if the hole should be 
abandoned or if a few million dollars more should be spent  to go down 
another thousand feet. Tell the truth, if you were in charge of such an 
operation and your job depended on its success who would you hire, a 
geologist who had a good working knowledge of evolution or a creationists who
thought the Bible would tell him where to find oil?
          

        >I think what we have is not merely some scientists stubbornly         
        >clinging to religious beliefs in the face of facts, but rather an         
        >**honest scientific dispute** 
          

There are many intelligent honest disagreement's over details, but I have no  
hesitation in calling any man who looks at the geological record and does not  
see enormous age, any man who does not see that animals have changed over 
time and that log ago they were far simpler than they are today, an idiot. 
Few of us respect members of the Flat Earth Society, I see no reason 
creationists deserve more credit, and I don't care how many degrees they  
have from the Upstairs Teachers Collage of South West North Dakota.
          

        >It is not honest for evolutionary theorists to say that they have a         
        >perfect, finished theory of the origin of life as yet, 


It is not honest to imply that they do.
          
        >but many act as if they do
          
Who?

Because the evidence in favor of the anthropic principle is nebulous and 
controversial and the evidence against it is nonexistent, we know almost 
nothing about it so it's difficult so say anything really stupid regardless 
of what position you take on the subject. On the other hand our knowledge of 
the history of life is vast and as our creationists fiends have proven quite 
easy to make an ass out of yourself.

I'd say the differences between what and how and why they're fighting are
fairly important too.  

HOW:
Freedom fighters, guerillas, survive only with the support of the population
in the area that they are fighting.  They attack by and large military and not
civilian targets.  Terrorist groups, which can refer to just about any
irregular fighting unit if we're going to be incredibly loose here, often and
purposely attack civilian targets, aim to make the population in which they
act scared stiff (as opposed to sympathetic to), and must work in opposition
to both populace and authorities.



WHAT and WHY:
And even if we're STILL going to stay that there is no difference really
between terrorist groups and freedom fighters, I'd say that the differences
between the justifications for each group are rather deeply important.  There
can be terrorist groups struggling to instate a dictator as easily as their
can be groups struggling to remove one.  And that difference is an objective
and important one.  This means that it is simply wrong, as Mark did, to simply
paint all terrorists with the same rationalistic brush and pretend that to
study them in order to destroy some of them is the mark of an oppressor.

The only real danger of such a society would be the enormous number of deaths
caused by lost tempers.  And no, I do not think that an armed society would
result in less crime.  I do think that it would result in more deaths.

Okay.  And then I could say that I predict we will.  We've both made

making of predictions prevent us from discovering "deep reality" (and I'm

This is interesting.  You don't think that you know that other human beings

Information IS an aspect of the world according to the argument I sketched out

Then what?  The scenario that we don't know how to reason is simply self-

physical phenomena.  The fact that I think that the world is flat that
underneath us is a gigantic Range Rover whose movements cause the wind and
earthquakes and such, would not prevent me, even in that situation, from
possibly concluding that there must be something about which there can be
information before there can be information.

On a separate note, I really think that the brain in the vat assumes a lot
less about consciousness than the software analogy, which doesn't I think work
necessarily.

You said that nothing can provide anything but information.  I disagreed, and

information.  I have no idea what that reply means.

Unless you're going to make every single cause and effect sequence an instance

Oh I disagree.  If your conception of language is correct, each and every one
of those letters means precisely something to the tree which gets hit.  If we
can say that the "grammar" of a genetic code is the fact that it works in 3
chemical units, then we can just as easily say that the "grammar" of lightning
is the angle of it, or even the lack of other bolts hitting the same tree (X
bolt communicates and no other bolt communicates, therefore the tree behaves
as thus...).

Extropian music is music that Extropians like !
Glass, Fripp and Eno, and Riley, along with  other music, has a psychological
aspect, the music is engineereed for a psychological reaction.  
The use of  music for creative purposes is Extropian.  It is Extropian to want
a  concentration of the mind, bringing power like Sufi or other sacred music.
The use or drone,  repitition, and ostinato have mind altering qualities if
you 'Listen' to them.

And isn't your statement about philosophy a philosophical one?  Isn't 
it therefore -- by your own definition (assuming the author to also 
be conscious and to be attempting a discussion of the issue) -- most 
likely nonsense, too?

It appears from off-list comments that I have upset some extropians with my

>From the August 7,1996 edition of the Globe & Mail newspaper
By Wallace Immen Medical Reporter

  A Saskatchewan researcher has identified the component of flaxseed that
reduces the risk of hardening of the arteries.
  While studies have shown that flaxseed in the diet reduces risk to the
arteries, humans would have to eat 1.5 grams a day for each kilogram they
weigh to get maximum benefits. Kailash Prasad of the University of
Saskatchewan's college of medicine found that a tiny fraction of the
seed, a compound known as SDG (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside), is the
artery-aiding material.
  When animals on high cholesterol diets were fed only 10 milligrams of SDG
per kilogram, it reduced the formation of fatty deposits in their arteries
by 73 per cent.
  "This does not negate the value of flaxseed in the diet," Dr. Prasad
said. Animals in another group fed large amounts of whole seed had a
46-per-cent reduction in the deposits, which can lead to heart attack and
stroke.
  In another experiment, Dr. Prasad found that rats fed SDG did not develop
diabetes even after attempts to induce it. He suggests SDG may also have an
effect in preventing development of diabetes in humans.
  "Most of the effect of SDG is from something other than cholesterol
lowering," he said. In fact, in animals fed whole seed, levels of
cholesterol actually increased. The compound's main effect appears to be
its ability to remove free radicals of oxygen, which are known to damage
cells and have been shown to increase development of atherosclerosis. The
research, supported by the Heart and Stroke  Foundation of Saskatchewan,
has been submitted to a journal for publication.
  The compound is not yet available commercially. The complex process to
remove SDG from flax meal was developed by scientists at the federal
Agriculture and Agrifood Canada laboratory in Saskatoon.

Additional note by poster:

  Flax oil does not have SDG in it. Flaxmeal/skim milk makes an enjoyable
morning meal. It thickens up much like porridge, but without the need for
heating. Flaxmeal goes rancid rapidly at room temperature (which might have
something to do with its lack of popularity). Fresh flaxmeal tastes
wonderful. It keeps well if stored in the freezer.

Apparently, Andrew, you have not been paying attention. Yes, we are saying that
if everyone had guns, then crime would decline dramatically. We now have proof
that this is true, thanks to the ground breaking work of Professor John Lott of
the University of Chicago, which you can read about in his book, _More Guns, Less
Crime_.

Moreover, Dodge City was not a crime center until after the Earp brothers forced
the City fathers to ban bearing of arms within city limits, despite what you may
have seen in the movies. The Earp brothers were the first organized crime family,
who used their law enforcement positions to control local alcohol, gambling, and
prostitution enterprises. They did this in Dodge City, then when they were run
out of town, they did the same thing in Tombstone. So, in the end, I don't want
this nation to become one big Dodge City either, which is why I support the right
of all to keep and bear arms, when, where, and as they please, as they are
guarranteed by the constitution.

Ok, here is another here and now factoid for your consumption. Last fall, my
brother was fishing in a stream. As he left the stream, he came across a gentleman
in a pickup staring intently at the screen of a laptop computer, which had a
RADAR-like display with little dots moving up stream. When asked, it turned out
that this man was a fisheries officer, and was tracking the migrating salmon via
needle sized chip/transponders that had been implanted in them prior to their
release as youngsters. The officer said that he had a range of up to a mile in
tracking these fish....

Yes an ID is extremely useful. That is the point of its being used as a tracking
device as well. The more difficult it is for each and every one of us to get
through life without one makes it that much easier for big brother to use it as a
platform when and where they find the neccessity/excuse to use it to violate the
rights we take for granted. You do not even need to know that your rights are
being violated for it to happen.

If the government makes the platform upon which they can track you a mandatory
item for you to get through your day, then you no longer have a choice about it,
and therefore your rights are violated.

Insufficient information at this time to make a calculation.

It is essentially about  the same amount of energy to accelerate from 90%c to
99%c, as it is to accelerate from 0%c to 90%c, and from 99%c to 99.9%c, and so
on. You can never reach 100%c, even if you consume all of the energy and mass in
the universe to do so, since the universe is finite. You could, however, keep
traveling for so many years at constant acceleration (ship time) that you
continue to loop entirely around the universe enough times that eventually your
ship posesses most of the energy in the universe, and the remaining mass is a
rarified vacuum interspersed with iron molecules.....and lots of neutrinos...

This is a good question, that I cannot answer at this time. I would suggest

1 g is 32 feet per second per second, or 9.8 meters per second per second

Like I said, eventually your ship would contain a huge amount of kinetic energy,
which could, at some point, create a singularity. That would be interesting to
see.

Well, it all depends on what your propulsion system is. If you are using a
reaction fuel based system, and are relying on internal fuel stores, he is
right, you won't last very long. However, it is theoretically possible to build
the interstellar equivalent of a ramjet that uses large magnetic fields to
funnel interstellar hydrogen into fusion reaction chambers, the energy gained
from which is used to propell the vehicle. Such a vehicle is capable of
traveling across  and around the entire universe at barely sublight speeds, and
it does not rely on 'exotic' technology at all (exotic is a term used by
physicist for classifiying physical processes not present in the local, macro
universe. Since hydrogen fusion is a local, macro phenomenon, it cannot be
classified as an 'exotic' power source).

Since warp phenomenon have been recently thought to only exist at a nano scale,
it is not likely that a workable drive could be built in a macro scale.

As well as on your continued rude habit of maintaining your addiction to
writing... discraceful...or so RAH thought...I've always said that punning is
like masturbation. Everyone enjoys it once in a while, but it shouldn't be done
in public....

Hmmm. Once upon a time, just above the worms, all animals had mobile larvae
which then settled down for life. Oysters, barnacles, sea urchins. The
sessile adult created zillions of eggs and sperm....

Then, somehow, the larvae became fertile, and the beginnings of vertebrate
life began. 

And, the USA was colonized by the mobile minority.

Sessile or mobile. Make your choice....

And so we have a logical argument for "intuition". Obviously the robot
will use what knowlege it has to decide. And this information may be
limited and faulty.

The whole point of Asimov's Laws is that they are ultimately unclear.

I belive it took 10,000 years to invent the Zero'th Law. And the Robots did
it, not the humans. How logical. Also, chaos theory hadn't been invented yet.

I can't agree with you more. Software deveopment managers are worse than
lawyers. I live in a mild climate, and I have:

1. water in my water heater
2. 20 gal propane tank, adaptor for small gas stove
3. canned goods
4. can opener

Course if you live in a cold climate, get a kerosene or gas heater.

I've been thru the Quake of 89 here, was 3 days without power. Hey,

Reminds me of pertussis (whooping cough). Here in Santa Cruz it became the
fashion for some parents to not immunize their children due to the small
but definite chance the child would have a negative reaction to the
immunization. What they didn't know or consider was that without
immunization pertussis is much more likely and the total harm much higher.
The result: Santa Cruz and San Mateo have the highest pertussis rates in
the nation, like 50x higher.

I am beginning to think that training in the use of firearms should be
mandatory.

Perhaps so, but I suspect constructing a circumstance to justify same is
about as easy as writing Godel's True but unprovable proposition.

No. Not acting results in 2 dead, picking one, by any criteria, results in
1 dead. Picking the nearest, or the one on the left would do.

Try again!

Well ... you need both the description AND its instantiation. In this case,
the description of the cubes is the math, but the cubes themselves and
shaking the box are also needed. And these days it is abundantly clear that
having only the description is not going to be much help in describing what
happens. Examples: Peano Axioms. Conway's Game of Life. Mandelbot Fractal.

I would assume, myself, that it has more to do with the fact that
zillions of europeans aren't shot to death by guns every year and
so they can see for themselves how not living in a country armed
to the teeth is healthier, despite whatever bullshit surveys the
gun nuts care to trot out.

This is a truly mind-boggling comment. Here we have someone who
has made an enormous amount of money marketing a crappy operating
system, arguably about as much "a disturbance of the natural
order" as you can get, and he's against cloning? Sheesh. Talk
about ungrateful.

What about manipulating diversity in the operating and

The interesting question is if it is possible to design music more
specifically to create the right psychological reaction. Right now it
is an art/craft with a lot of rather disorganized knowledge. Maybe
advances in biomusicology (yes, the subject exists!) could help make
it clearer and more powerful.

It might turn out that we need to tune the music styles to our own
personalities and representations to get maximal effect, any ideas on
how to optimize this? This also fits in with adapting other mental
tools to ourselves; we need a better way to 'install' them.

I think we have our own group of Neo Creationists
here on the list.  I'm always hearing, "that
wouldn't work without some form of AI" proposed as
a "solution."  I actually think both Creationists
and AI-obsessives have the same basic problem,
they have no idea what they mean by
"intelligence."  Come on, "evolution must have
been guided by some form of higher intelligence"
is like saying "evolution pop ruffle huzzah."

Do you ditrust the people of your good country *so much* that you don't
want them to have the means to defend themselves? Sheesh!  Better take
the knives & hammers away too, not to mention cars (now there's a
projectile that can kill over great distances) before anyone hurts
himself. Let me guess, you (and a significant portion of other Aussies)
have gotten hysterical about guns due to that freak Tasmanian killing
spree, right? Talking about overreacting (if you'd consequently ban
anything that killed someone, there wouldn't be much left)...The irony
is that a well-armed population would have stopped such a maniac dead in
his tracks (by shooting him, obviously). 

When you outlaw or heavily restrict the use of guns, you give the most
dangerous individuals in society, the criminals, a huge advantage over
the "law-abiding citizens". In the land of the unarmed, the dude with
the gun is king. No way that you can disarm the criminals too, not even
in a totalitarian state. So dear anti-gunner, every time some innocent
victims dies, gets raped, robbed or severly injured because s/he wasn't
allowed to defend him/herself properly, the blood is on *your* hands
too.

Here's, once agian, the *right* way to take on the crime problem: allow
all citizens with a clean criminal record (for violent crime) and no
obvious mental diseases to have at least one (hand) gun which can be
used at home and carried (discretely) concealed on the street. Training
classes which teach shooting skills, mental empowerment, safety measures
for handling weapons etc. can be made compulsory for anyone who wishes
to own a weapon, basically the equivalent of driving lessons. Only those
that pass may own a gun. This service must be either free or at minimal
costs, so that anyone can afford it. Conplimentary classes could include
street fighting skills, using nonlethal weapons (which should be freely
available to any adult) etc.

The use of video/audio surveillance is promoted. The government takes
care of the surveillance of public spaces, beginning with busy shopping
areas and (other) known crime hotspots. Gradually, safe corridors will
be created, so that one has camera protection all the way from one's
home to the shopping district, workplace etc. If you're squemish about
privacy (what privacy is there in public places anyway?), you can always
move into the countryside.

Shop keepers and home owners are incouraged to install cams & audios in
and around the home/shop, and leave them running all the time
(especially when they aren't at home/at night). Cameras are excellent
preventive tools (much cheaper and effective than "youth reform
programs" and such), and the best source of hard evidence one can have.

All cops get bodycams, guncams and carcams to prevent bad behaviour, and
to serve as evidence in case of a conflict. 

At the same time all "victimless crimes" such as the use of/trade in
recreational drugs are legalized, and the penalties for the remaining
(real) crimes go up. Murder is punishable by death, the mode of
punishment being so that it fits the crime. Justice is served "swift &
sure", within weeks of the arrest. Manslaughter is punished by 5-20
years of hard labor/regular prison, depending on the severity of the
crime. Rape and other violent offences agains persons make one liable
for corporal punishment and incarceration and the payment of damages to
the victim, economic crimes/crimes against property result in prison
(labor camps) and/or fines.

Prisons (and lobaor camps) are largely automated, there are different
facilities for different types of offenses and inmates are not allowed
to have physical contact. Conditions are sober but clean, food can be
costumized to one's personal needs. Entertainment is highly restricted.

don't forget music generated by microprocessors! Kraftwerk, Jean
Michelle-Jarre, techno, house, Caberet Voltaire, Deep Forest, HipHop
(yes HipHop, it does a great job of describing the modern urban
experience through electronically produced music, giving modern urban
dance culture a frame of reference)
AirLiquid, RoniSize ('change my life....') the Orb, anything really on
the Astralwerks record label.
The techno explosion is all about cheap disposable, recycleable, music
made by the microprocessor/human interface. This is the folk music of
the future. Is is the driving, pounding soundtrack to the information
age. Passionate and dispassionate, pretty and sterile, virtual and
virtuoso. Everything that technology promises to be. Slapping soulful
house lyrics on top of clinically accurate beats is like slapping XML on
top of HTML. Having eerie spacey synth pads play over distorted
energetic breakbeats is like a cold ATM in a local fruit market. The
replacement of jazz for acid jazz, roomfuls of violinists for a sampler,
a conducter, orchestrator and composer for MIDI, virtual concerts via
the internet instead of huge concert halls all represtent the
digitizing, 'uploading' if you will of our common cultural aesthetic.

I've seen many attempts at generative music
synthesisers that watch facial heat patterns to
tell your mood. And some researchers have been
working on integrating brain wave readings with
similar systems. There has been several CD
collections released by them, although I can't
remember the names. No doubt some of these
technologies could be used to determine what your
likes and dislikes are so that a more personal
model of you can be built.

What I'd really like is a walkman that detects
when I'm running plays 70's cop show chase music
so I can be just like Shaft :-)

Since morality has been discussed much on this list, I thought this "definition"
might be of interest -- especially, since many people on the list seem to equate
"morality" with "social ethics."  If that were so, then morality would be needed
only in a society.  It would have no meaning for a lone individual.

Subject: proposed definition of morality

   I somewhat tentatively propose the following as definitions:

_Morality_ is the deliberate subordination of conduct to normative
principles because such subordination is necessary for the pursuit
of excellence.

_Excellence_ is the flourishing of the volitionally created self.

       These are heavily theory-laden definitions:  Outside the
context of a Randian theory of free will they don't make sense.

Tempers would be more easily found, if the consequences
for losing one were so often so lethal.  No doubt there would
be more deaths in the first several years.  But this is not a 
result of having the guns, but of *not* having the guns previously.

Don't shut up about it!  I believe I read in either Benson's _The Enterprise of
Law_ or Friedman's _The Machinery of Freedom_ that Dodge City's worse
year had only five murders.  That's hardly material for one episode of "Gun
Smoke" -- much less a year in highly gun controlled New York City.:)

I'm going roller blading.

That's five murders for, what, a population of less than 2000?  I don't think
that NYC has five murders per every hundred thousand.

Maybe one could apply the work being done on wearable computers and
affective computing to this. Clyne's ideas about sentics (wild as they
might be) could also be useful.

Mood music for what one is doing. Nice. Damien Broderick described the
mood of AI programs in _The White Abacus_ in that way, by mentioning
what music they hear from the information nets.

We've had many discussions of guns here over the years, often associated with
a strangely un-extropic national chest thumping, most especially as between
folks in the U.S. and Europe (with the Antipodean growl a more recent new
theme).  In my view, it's an issue of liberty and rationality.  By and large,
extropians seek solutions to social problems that are premised on maximal
individual liberty.  On the other hand, extropians should be open to consider
any rational proposal for addressing an issue such as social violence.

The context of gun ownership is obviously very, very different in the US and
other parts of the world.  Many non-Americans seem to begin their analysis of
gun issues by looking at the existing "background" level of violence in the
U.S.  As I look at European societies (and Australia and New Zealand, for that
matter), I see groups of people that are orders of magnitude more ethnically
and culturally homogenous than what one finds in many areas of the U.S.  In
fact, one has to look very hard to find any other society in history that has
been as culturally and ethnically heterogenous as the U.S. is now.  That there
is a relatively high level of violence among such a disparate grouping of
people isn't surprising, especially one that, at least in principle, eschews
central governmental control as much as possible and has had, at times, one of
the most open immigration schemes of any society in history.  Couple that with
the extreme growth in numbers of young people (and hence, young men) that has
characterized the last 30 years, and one could hardly come up with a better
prescription for violence.

As was pointed out here recently, all forms of violence are decreasing in the
U.S.  The very obvious cause of this is the relative decline in the proportion
of young men in the population.  Regulation of gun ownership seems to have
little to do with this, although the statistics showing a positive correlation
between violence of all types and RESTRICTIONS on gun ownership in the U.S.
appear to be fairly compelling.  Every state that has instituted a "concealed
carry" law has expereinced a greater than average drop in violent crime over
the last ten years in the U.S.

As an American who travels abroad frequently, I do find some non-American
attitudes toward gun ownership a little annoying at times.  There is little
chance that European countries will liberalize their gun laws any time soon,
so I wonder at the vehemence with which some Europeans voice anti-gun
sentiments.  Why such strong sentiments? I wonder.  And, as a matter of
personal anecdote, I find that many of these strong sentiments are based on
the grossest misconceptions of the quality of life in America: Just so the
record is clear for folks who haven't been here, in most of the U.S. gun
violence is non-existent.  There are not shootings on every street corner and
Hollywood movies and television shows are NOT an accurate depiction of life in
the United States.  There's certainly a firearm in far more than half of the
houses on my quiet, multiethnic street, and I haven't heard a gunshot in my
neighborhood in the eight years I've lived here.  There also hasn't been a
burglary and people often leave their houses unlocked.

thanks Greg for a post that considers both the issues of insisting on

I've been playing around with some simple MIDI
programs recently and none of them struck me as
being highly "creative" environments. I decided to
set myself the small project of programming a nice
new experimental interface for music generation.
I've been toying around with different ideas and
then...

After an exhaustive search (I never knew this
field was so big) I found some interesting
research on musical AI and object oriented music.
I followed a few links around and now my small
project has been inflated by the huge amount of
ideas on this subject. My reading list will, when
I've sorted through the list of books I found on
the subject, no doubt be another several pages in
length. Sometimes I hate the undying pursuit of
knowledge!

What would be really rather nice - an interface
where you can tweak certain emotions and feelings,
perhaps created by interacting musical agents.

Here's some resources (in the form of huge lists
of books, publications, etc):

http://kafka.uvic.ca/lem/docs/audio/FAQ/
computer_music.html

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/midi/bibliography/
section-1.html

Sorry for the line wraps (50 chars just looks
good). Btw, if anyone can recommend *good* books
on the subject I'd greatly appreciate it.

True enough, though to be fair, we'd also have to look at guns possessed
per unit of population too.  Also, the point is that Dodge City just was not as
violent during the late 1800s as people tend to think it was.  Until we have
reliable stats on it, we should not use it as an epitaph to the Second
Amendment.

A question: would you rather live in a society which is more violent but freer
(in terms of choices you can make about living your life) or one which is less
violent but also less free (in terms of ditto)?  I tend to think the freer a
society is, in general, the less violent it will be -- if one factors in
government
violence too.  (How many people were gunned down by cops in the US this
year, under questionable circumstances?  Howw many people were jailed,
etc. under ditto?)

Cheers!

With respect to what inertial frame? a constant 1 g accel will get you
to near light-speed fairly quickly, so for long trips your time will
asymptotically approach one year per light-year as measured on earth. 
As measured aboard ship, space contraction will become extreme, and you
can go just about anywhere in the universe in two years (as I recall from
Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero"). Of course there is the small problem of the
energy/propellant needed to maintain 1g for 2 years... 

For the Earth-inertial computation, you  can start with a classical
analysis: s=.5at^2, where a=g=9.8m/sec^2. and s is in meters.
   For L (distance in light-years) L=s/(300,000,000*sec/year)
A day is 86,400 sec, so SY=sec/year is about 31,557,600 sec. Therefore
for t= 1 year, L=.5*9.8m/sec^2 * year^2/ (300,000,000* SY) *SY^2

L= 4.9*31,557,600/300,000,000

Hmm, unless I messed up, it looks like we aren't even a whole light-year
away, even ignoring relativity. We are, however going at a relativistic
speed, so time dilation may kick in.

Let's face it: we have an image problem. No matter how reasonable our
views appear to us, no matter how correct they actually are, most
people do not consider transhumanism or its subset extropianism
seriously.

I recently wrote that many people actually think extropians are
gun-toting survivalists believing in a technocalypse; the current
debate about heavily fortified island nations, surviving the Y2K
problem and escaping into space wasn't helping the image. Den Otter
promptly replied that we are survivalists (in the sense of not wanting
to die prematurely and doing something about it), often believe in a
singularity and would have great use for an island nation with
transhumanism-friendly laws. This is of course true, but misses the
point in a rather revealing way.

When most people use the word survivalist they refer to the image of a
weapon-fanatic loner on the extreme right who plans to survive and
prosper when everybody else gets their well-deserved disaster. When
people overhear you talking about the Singularity, you could just as
well speak about the Rapture or New Age Prophecied By The
Mahatmas. And proposing a libertarian island kingdom suggests images
of piracy, drug trafficing, child porn and money laundering.

It doesn't matter if these views are right or wrong as long as people
hold them: they make us look like a cult.

If people think you are some kind of extreme cult they will treat you
like a cultist - with all that that entails.

Among the common behaviors used by all humans when faced with a
ranting cultist is to stop listening to the ranting as soon as you are
certain enough that you are dealing with a crazie; the more radical
and upsetting the ideas, the faster you want to stop listening and the
easier it is to decide it is just cultishness. 

First impressions last. If people come upon transhumanism as some kind
of new age cult, right-wing extremism or fascism they will treat it
like that, and not investigate further. They will even spread the
word, and we all end up shunned by decent company. But I want my
membership in Aleph and Extropy Institute to be something to be proud
of, something that looks good on my CV!

This is why we better do something about our image. I believe we have
great ideas with practical content. But we better present them well,
in a form that people can understand and accept rather than
immediately reject. It would be obvious to anybody planning to live a
transhuman life that being good at communicating with other people is
a high priority if you want to live in a society with them and get
them to help you. 

Many transhumanists make the mistake of becoming so used to all our
fantastic ideas (after all, most are rather down-to-earth when you
think of them carefully ;-) that they assume everybody else also will
understand how reasonable nanotechnology, cryonics and singularities
are. The listeners, who doesn't regard them as reasonable or obvious
since they have not heard very much convincing evidence or have no
collaborating experience, simply concludes that the transhumanist has
read too much science fiction. And in the absence of facts they are
making the simplest choice, applying Occam's razor correctly: the
theory that the transhumanist is right is much more complex than the
theory that he is just an overenthusiastic weirdo, so it should be
rejected until further evidence shows him to be right or at least
somewhat connected to reality. 

This is why we better learn to present our ideas calmly, gradually and
with as much supporting facts as possible. Don't rush it, don't try to
make people swallow the entire bizarre package of ideas at
once. Instead give them one interesting idea to chew on first, like
dynamic optimism or wearable computers. They will come up with new
ideas and questions on their own (which they tend to accept much more
readily than other's), which can be discussed further. Even better,
let them discover for themselves how the various fairly interesting
but relatively uncontroversial ideas link together into a whole, with
implications they certainly wouldn't have believed if they hadn't
thought of them themselves...

Another problem we have is that we use a lot of weird terminology and
even worse, hot button words that cause learned emotional reactions
('immortality'. 'genetic engineering'. 'freedom'. 'market'). Sometimes
it is useful to get an emotional reaction, but quite often it limits
the possible repertoire of thinking. When you are aroused, you tend to
select cognitive patterns that are fast and well-learned and use them
with a minimum of thinking - the famous 'knee jerk reaction', although
it can be more subtle and flexible than that. If we are not careful,
we will close off the possibility of communication just by the way we
discuss. 

This doesn't mean we will give in to the misinformed views of people
around us, quite the opposite! It is better to act by spreading
information and ideas, gradually and friendly instead of trying to
browbeat them to see something they don't believe in. By communicating
well with other people you can spread your ideas efficiently; that way
the facts and good ideas will be spread, and you might even learn
useful things from others (including the occasional realization that
their misinformed view actually was valid). Sometimes you might have
to take a verbal fight or make a stand against pure stupidity, and
then you better employ your passion, rationality and verbal skills to
maximal effect without fear or hesitation, but it is inefficient to
waste them on "winning" small arguments.

I don't want us to become politically correct. I don't want
self-censorship. But I want the ability to explain clearly and
rationally, and the ability to swallow the worst blunders before you
say them. Think of what you are saying and how people will react to
it!

Some excellent points, Anders: As always, you are the very Voice of Reason. As
a professional communicator, I can say that you've captured many of the
essential points of effective and persuasive communication.  Time and again
the masters of rhetoric admonish us to do the things you have advised:

-- take things one relatively small step at a time so that your audience can
follow you;
-- start with the simple and mundane;
-- avoid wherever possible inflaming your audience against you;
-- seek gradual agreement with your ideas;
-- offer premises and invite conclusions;
-- acknowledge reasonable questions and deal with them fairly.

Over the last couple of months I've engaged in a little experiment in
communicating transhumanist ideas and extropian values in a completely "cold"
environment.  Probably nine or ten times now I've created a chatroom in AOL
called "Transhuman Science" in the same area where one finds the New Age and
religious rooms, as well as other special interest topics.  The title of the
room has attracted a good number of people. (Sometimes as many as 10 or 12 at
a time).  I prepare for "guests" in the room by having some short sentences
pre-typed in a text file to cut and paste to answer the usual opening question
of "what's this room about?" -- in fact, I use a condensed version of your
introduction to Transhumanism, Anders: that question is met with the reply,
"Transhumanists advocate using technology to overcome our biological limits."
Discussion starts from there.  Having that text in my clipboard buffer ready
to paste helps keep things going when newcomers ask about the room's topic.

I've found the usual spectrum of questions and doubts:

"Won't we become inhuman?"
"Won't longer life spans cause overpopulation?"
"It's not natural."
"It's a sin."
"You don't need technology to do all those things, you can do it with (faith,
meditation, interdimensional crystal power something-or-other)."

By patiently using the Socratic method of questioning the assumptions upon
which the questions and doubts are based, I've been able to maintain a tone of
respectful dialogue in the room.  On more than one occasion, I've had people
comment on the fact that the room addresses basic and important ideas without
devolving into a shouting match, the usual fate of such discussions in AOL's
chatrooms.  

Overall, my experience with perhaps 75 or 80 visitors to the chatroom is that
usually one or two in every session eventually find the ideas compelling.  I
post up references to the various transhumanist and extropian web sites, which
I also keep handy for cutting and pasting, so they can follow up with visits
to those more developed areas.  Usually one or two end up stating an
inflexible opposition to the idea, but by maintaining a respectful and patient
attitude, they leave without rancor.  The majority of people end up with at
least a positive view of transhumanism and a reasonable exposure to the basic
ideas.

In these sessions, I avoid making statements like "our goal is to turn
ourselves into synthetic brains the size of large planets," "we want to get to
work right away completely overhauling the human genome," "we want to get rid
of the government," "we want to transfer our consciousness to computers as
soon as possible because they're more durable."  Instead, I like to use
examples like pacemakers for cyborgization (I never use the word "cyborg"
first, but someone usually does pretty quickly, and I respond by acknowledging
it and immediately using positive and mundane examples like artifical knees
and eyeglasses), and the use of writing for neurological engineering.  Using
the Socratic method and as much humor as I can muster, I keep the conversation
near the point of using advanced medical technology for ameliorating disease,
and only when I have some consensus move to the point of augmentation.

I try to keep my temper and humor when I encounter the common references to
religion and new age BS.  I've found a very useful tool is to pick the most
sloppy term out of such comments and say something like "I don't know what
‘spirit' means -- what do you mean by that word?"  Then, I can usually simply
respond to their reply by saying, "I call that mind, and see it as a function
of the brain."  If someone persists in demanding to know what will happen to
the "soul", I politely tell them that I can't account for something I can't
measure or detect, and end by saying that "it appears we have fundamental
differences about the nature of life."  Since most new agers and religious
people innately understand that a spiritualistic world view necessarily
entails a lack of certainty and an impossibility of agreement among people,
they remain silent after such a statement.  Using such rhetorical tactics
allows the conversation to stay more or less on track and gives me the ability
to steer it back into concrete terms.

This is just one example of the kind of meme propagation that we can do.  Some
people are better at such tasks than others and have more patience for it.  I
know some very good people who simply don't have the temperament to engage in
such dialogue.  Those of us who are less bright may serve the cause by trying
to propagate a good "image of transhumanism", as you put it, Anders.

You can subscribe to www.lycaeum.org - they have a nice anon remail

John, you haven't been reading. Practically my only point has been that
there are creationists who DO see enormous age; their whole theories work
within the same chronology as evolutionary theory. This mistake of yours
plays into their hands; they can say that your so close-minded that you

I further predict that I'm correct so you'll never find a counterexample to

that I'm correct, that is, a way to demonstrate it in a finite number of

Great! Even though I'm the one who used the term so I'm sure it has profound 
significance, I really wish somebody would explain it to me because I haven't 
a clue.                

        >You're assuming mental content to be a function only of complexity.

If so then religious people are right, the soul exists. I think that is, to

        >This is interesting.  You don't think that you know that other human

I think other people are conscious, at least part of the time, because they 
act that way, but not when they're in a deep sleep or a coma or dead. To put 
it another way, I assume something is conscious if it act intelligently. I 
admit that all this is just an assumption but we'll never get anything better.

I think I know approximately what you mean but I'll never know for certain if  
I'm correct.
         
        >And you are not sure if lightning is or is not conscious?


I assume that lightning and trees and rocks are not conscious because they 
don't act intelligently but I'll never know for certain if I'm correct. It's  
not a perfect rule of thumb but I couldn't live my life any other way and 
there is no hope of finding anything better.

        >consciousness must be for there to be a language.


Let's see, I know other people are conscious because they use language and I 
can tell it's a language because the people are conscious. What's wrong with 
this picture?

         >>Me:
         >>no two lightning bolts on planet earth have ever been identical,         
         >>and no two target trees for them to hit either. 

         >Assume that it does.  

Ok, I have no trouble imagining a hypothetical world where everything is 
different and where lightning is a language, we just don't happen to live in  
such a world.
         
        >If your conception of language is correct, each and every one of         
        >those letters means precisely something 
         

A letter mean nothing, it's only when they're combined into words do they  
become symbols related to something concrete. In the case of the genetic code 
3 letters symbolize an amino acid, lightning has no words and so symbolizes  
nothing.
          
        >If we can say that the "grammar" of a genetic code is the fact that         
        >it works in 3 chemical units,         


There is no "if" about it, that's the way the genetic code works.  
          

        >then we can just as easily say that the "grammar" of lightning        >is the angle of it

As I said, a language with an infinite number of letters is gibberish.

         >>Me:
         >>in what way would the ribosome act differently if CAU did mean

         >It wouldn't, necessarily.
          

Apparently you don't realize it but by making this huge concession you've 
thrown in the towel. If meaning doesn't change anything, then there is no  
point in talking about it. If you're right then I'd have no way of showing  
that language exists, not ever. You expressed incredulity that someone could  
believe that another human being is not conscious but now you say that
behavior is no guide to the mental state of anything. If as you say behavior 
is no indicator of sentience then I have absolutely no reason to think that 
words mean anything to you or that you're more conscious than the average 
rock.

One other thing, although our internal mental states and emotions may be 
priceless to us they are of interest to evolution only as they effect 
behavior, and if they don't then there is no way random mutation and natural 
selection could have produced it for us to enjoy. Yet we have it, or at least 
I do.

The logic is impeccable and the conclusion absurd, therefore the premise must 
be wrong, we CAN deduce meaning from behavior and it something starts to 
attach meaning to a great many things, much, much, more than the 64 simple  
triplets that ribosomes can handle, then we can begin to start calling  
something like that conscious.

Depends on frame of reference. Aboard the ship, the power required rises
indefinitely, as does the perceived velocity relative to the universe due
to time dilation and space contraction. On Earth, you simply grow more
massive and keep approaching C, with an eventually constant power requirement.

The term "much" is approximate and I don't know how to calculate the

No, I don't think I've missed the point, lines 4-6 acknowledge your

==============

Some key points are:
--Image may be important, but ultimately what counts is survival
and flourishing. The actual goals should not be compromised too
much for PR reasons (this reminds me of the story of the three pigs
and the big bad wolf; pigs one and two don't take the Coming of the
Wolf (Singularity/Y2K/WW3 etc) too seriously, and make their houses
of bad materials. The wise survivalist pig takes a lot more trouble
to build a solid house, and doesn't give in to peer pressure from
the other pigs, that scoff at his work. Of course we all know what 
happens afterwards... ;-)

--Right now, there are hardly any projects (that I'm aware of) that
deal with the practical side of facing the future. Ideally, there
would be a transhuman network that could at least partially survive
a collapse of society. I know, it sounds paranoid, but when your
goal is immortality, and you live on earth, you *better* be "paranoid".
Also a >H network of this kind would have many useful spinoffs such
as suspension facilities and community forming. One thing that would
certainly be needed is a radio network: in case of some disaster
the net would be one of the first things to go.

--Apart from major disasters etc, there are the problems of everyday
life. Since money can buy you just about anything, including health, 
hapiness and life extension, it should be a major point on the 
transhuman agenda. Wealth is essential for survival and flourishing.

--If you want a "clean" image *and* the practical "survivalist" stuff,
you need to create separate organizations. There are already several
educational organizations (WTA, ExI, WFS etc) but none that deal 
specifically with the practical side of transhumanism: how can we 
maximalize our chances to survive and flourish in the twilight of 
humanity and beyond? Such an organization would most likely be
low-profile, since others do the message-spreading, and would 
mostly draw members from within the transhuman community. Touchy
but practical (or just interesting) issues would be handled on 
a separate list.

The problem is, if we were to chat on this list so that it is 
acceptable and understandable to most people, the discussions
would be, um, rather lame. I've said it before, and I'll say it
again: what we need is a private list, where one can speak freely. 
Censorship is bad for any conversation...

I find it helpful to talk about some 'exotic' technology in conjunction
with a present technology that was considered exotic in the recent past.

For instance, I was talking to a family member about a recent article I
read on one company's research into bioimplants of personal computers. I
jokingly stated that I would be the first on line to receive such an
implant. He said I was crazy and didn't think it would ever happen. I
had him recall watching StarTrek as a child and how exotic personal
handheld communicators seemed back then. Now even he is getting a
cell-phone!

Let's use some method. In order to improve the image of 
transhumanism, we need to identify what the weak points are and how 
they could be strengthened.

This suggests a nice two-phase project: (1) find out what the most 
common questions/objections are; (2) develop some good ways of 
answering them.

Let's begin with (1). I will make a list of the five most common 
questions/objections that I have encountered when presenting 
transhumanist ideas to outsiders. Could other people here who have a 
som eexperience in talking about transhumanism please do likewise, 
and send these lists of five to me (n.bostrom@lse.ac.uk). This should 
be very easy and just take a minute or two. I will classify the 
objections and count their frequency and post the results back to 
this list. That will naturally lead on to step (2).

Here's my list, Nick:

1.  Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

2.  Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

3.  Isn't death part of the natural order of things?

4.  Won't extended lifespans cause overpopulation problems?

5.  Will only the rich and powerful have access to augmentation?

Note that some of these questions have been addressed fairly well in the FAQs
you'll find at Alcor's and Extropy Institute's web sites.

I distrust *everyone* who is better armed than myself, and I only
have my hands. It has nothing to do with my countrymen, it has to
do with the fact that humans, at this stage, are an inherently
violent species. I would have thought that here, standing on the
edge of the 20th century, people would realise this, instead of
carrying on as if killing other people was some sort of god-given
right, when it is merely an ability, and something one shouldn't
take too much pride in.

Get a grip. None of these things can project force beyond
themselves. Guns can. If someone attacks you with a knife or a
hammer, you are able to defend yourself much better than against
someone with a gun. I've never seen anyone throw a car at anyone
else, that would be pretty impressive.

Um. No. I thought guns were stupid and pro-gun activists were
dangerous maniacs for a long time.

> Talking about overreacting (if you'd consequently ban

I don't want to ban everything dangerous. Of course, like most
foaming at the mouth pro guns fanatics, you will take my
perfectly feasible comment ("guns are far too dangerous to have
loose in the community") and decide that I'm against everything
not made out of foam rubber. All this does is paint you as an
over-reacting hysterical fool, which is a bit of a shame, as I'd
rather discuss than vehemently argue.  I do want to ban distance
weapons. I'll take my chances against someone else's arm, not
against something at a speed of miles per second.

Oh golly. So we lost a dozen or two people. We *didn't* lose the
thousands of other people that year who would have been killed by
a drunk, jealous, pissed off or insane population of gun-carrying
individuals.

Despite living in the country which appears to have the record
for most people shot in a single sitting in peacetime, I'd still
rather live here than in a country where everyone is allowed to
carry guns, and does so. It's just safer. Isn't it obvious?

Um, well, I don't know where you live, but criminals on the whole
are a very small percentage of the population. The number of
people who fly into fits of rage and assault people is probably
higher than the number of armed hardened criminals. I'd rather
take my chances with a heavily-armed professional than a
moderately armed very very angry (and possibly intoxicated)
person.

Yup. So I just avoid the person with the crown and the gun. At
least *everyone else* is safe to be around.

I'll cope. Like I said, I live in a fairly peaceful society, and
in most assault situations the injuries are caused by either bare
hands or something heavy and blunt. This is good. If you add guns
to this mix many more people will die. I know where I'd rather
live, and I do.

As I'm sure I've pointed out, this is just so obviously stupid as
to boggle the mind. I'm sure you feel you're right. I don't. And,
strangely enough, it's hard to find anyone other than an american
who will agree with you. Doesn't this suggest to you that this is
a cultural issue, not an easily-proven theory based on fact?

I am all in favour of training in self-defence. I personally feel
that any weapon capable of causing substantial damage to a human,
such as guns, swords, etc, should be banned. People with
legitimate reasons for owning such would be okay, but in general,
a country with a heavily-armed population is a dangerous place to
live.

By the principle of relativity (which says that you can't tell if you're
moving, i.e. all motion is relative), it can't make any difference how
fast someone else thinks you are going.  So it will take the same amount
of power, from your point of view, to accelerate at 1 g, no matter how
fast someone else thinks you are going.

As you go faster relative to the universe, it looks to you like the
universe (stars, galaxies, etc.) is going faster relative to you.  As the
stars approach the speed of light, they don't speed up as much as you
would expect given the 1 g acceleration that you feel.  They approach
the speed of light slower and slower, but do not exceed it.  What happens
instead is that they undergo Lorentz contraction, flattening out in the
direction of motion.

The net result is that you go past stars, galaxies, etc., faster and
faster, not because they are moving past you more quickly, but because
they are becoming thinner and flatter, so even though they never move
faster than the speed of light, you move past more of them in a given
amount of time.

In relativity, given constant acceleration "a", the equations of motion
are as follows:

Let t be the time measured by the moving observer.  Then the distance
he has travelled as measured by a stationary observer is:

    X = 1/g * sinh (g*t).

The time it has taken for him to travel this far, as measured by a
stationary observer, is:

    T = 1/g * cosh (g*t).

sinh and cosh are "hyperbolic sine" and "hyperbolic cosine", defined as

sinh(x) == 1/2 * (e^(x) - e^(-x))
cosh(x) == 1/2 * (e^(x) + e^(-x))

Here, x, t, and a must be measured in relativistic units where c = 1
e.g. x is in light years, t is in years.  In these units, 1 g is
approximately 1/light-year.  So after 1 subjective year at 1 g, t = 1

and

    X = 1/2 * (e - 1/e) = 1.18 light years
    T = 1/2 * (e + 1/e) = 1.54 years

After a large number of subjective years at 1 g, the equation can be
simplified to approximately X = T = e^t.  You are moving at close to the
speed of light, hence X = T in these units (e.g. it takes 100 years for
you to travel 100 light years as measured by a stationary observer).
But with time as measured by you, the distance you cross in terms of
galaxy units is exponential.

You don't?  

I've noticed that some memes have a very...VERY strong hold.  Relegious memes
for example...or the anti-gun meme.  Facts make very little impression on
those who are infected by that meme.  

For example...it has already been metioned that when gun profliferation
increases among the populace as a whole that violent crimes decrease. This is
documented...repeatable...and is not subject to doubt.  The phrase "An armed
society is a polite society"...has basis in fact.  It happens every time. Well
this is in contradiction to the antigun meme...so it gets ignored.


"Don't bother me with facts...my mind is made up".

How do you combat such highly infectious mind destroying memes?

Here are the questions I get asked:

- Why would you want to live longer?
- Won't improving you use up resources and diminish others?
- Isn't this a sin, against God, against nature, etc.?
- Why should you get improved and not others?  (assumes not others)
- What if it doesn't work?  Is there evidence it will happen?

Which is why in my recent posting of notable quotes on gun ownership, only the

Yes, we are starting to see the anti-gun lobbyists pushing to have gun violence
made into a 'health' issue, and they are filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers
much like the recent lawsuits against the tobacco industry, in an attempt to drive
gun makers out of business.

I would put the situation differently. I would say that individuals who did not
take reasonable measures to protect and defend themselves, their loved ones, and
their property, are putting an undue burden on society at large in terms of the
health care costs to take care of these irresponsible people, and their
dependents, orphans, etc. It is they who should be getting the subpoenas.

This idea is paralleled in the situation in Washington State, where you have the
rurual counties have passed county ordinances requiring every household to posess
a firearm and ammunition, and undergo training in their use, while the urban
counties are pushing greater gun control meausres. It is interesting that in that
state alone, crime in rural counties has gone down, while crime in urban counties
has gone up....

The best I can figure, having starting off with a population that has been
filtered of its dissatisfied elements (emigrated to the US, as opposed to
Australia and NZ populations, which started off with prisoners and shifted to
plantation owners) in the last several centuries, while the remainder lived in
feudal societies that recognised that the only people with a right to bear arms
were the aristocracy (yet they forget that here in the US, one of our goals is to
give everyone the power of the aristocracy). Also, you have a population that has
suffered through two world wars (while they ignore that Switzerland, a country
where every household is armed, did not suffer thus), that ought to make any right
thinking descendant of the peasants/serfs a little phobic of arms of all types,
while they ignore the fact that the reason they were so easily conquered by
agressor nations is that their governments had policies of requiring registration
of firearms, which made it that much easier to locate and confiscate the firearms
that were held by the 'deviant' members of the population when the nogoodniks
marched into town.

Yes. It is much the same up here in New Hampshire. People leave their cars and
houses unlocked as a matter of habit. Even with such lack of security, our level
of robberies is far lower than in the cities where people use all manner of
security systems. Amazing what one gun can do as a deterrent, eh? My parents live
in one of the more wealthy neighborhoods in town here, and all the neighbors are
typically as lax, yet there has not been a robbery since the late 70's in that
neighborhood, and most residents are armed.

Drunk drivers kill more people by far in our area than all categories of mortal
violent crime combined, yet only in the most eggregious cases are murder charges
filed. As for personal knowledge, several freinds of mine have died in drunk
driving accidents since we graduated from high school here in 86, yet the last
person I personally knew who was murdered was killed in 1976, and they lived in
Massachusetts.

Police are more likely to kill innocent civilians in a shoot out than they are to
kill the criminals... hmmm

Yes, if you look at the US on a state by state basis, you will find that states
which have more freedom overall will tend to have lower crime rates. That is even
with states which are next to each other. For example, crime in Massachusetts is
very high, yet its next door neighbor, New Hampshire, which is less than 30 minutes
from downtown Boston, has a far far lower rate of crime and a much freer system of
gun laws, (we go by the concealed carry standard for everyone except felons, of
course), that is in line with small european nations. Another state bordering
Massachusetts, Vermont, has an even lower crime rate and has possibly the most free
gun laws in the nation (you need no permit at all). I have recently been seeing
some really stupid gun  laws being proposed in our state legislature, like banning
guns from all government buildings, from all public buildings, etc. I expect that
passage of such laws will lead to higher crime rates...

Right... so surely armed private citizens will somehow manage to shoot just
the criminals and not each other, right?

SInce it seems you are still caught in the Chistian "Thou Shalt Not Kill" meme,
here's some information for you: In the original Hebrew, that commandment says
"Thou Shalt Not Murder". Killing is perfectly acceptable, murdering is not. and
there is a distinct difference.

A car is controllable, so even if a person dodges what they perceive the course
of the car to be, the driver can still change course to mow down the pedestrian.
Now, if I were drunk and out of my mind and went out and shot a bunch of people,
I'd get the electric chair, yet if I did the same with a car, I'd most likely
get a manslaughter or negligent homicide charge.

Yes, we have a saying here: A Republican is merely a Democrat who has been

Since only law abiding people obey gun laws, your argument is specious. The
statistics of car violence also expose your hypocracy. We do not say that you
think that you want to ban everything not made out of foam rubber. Your own
attitude screams that you want to tread down the slippery slope to tyranny.

In gun related crime, less than 30% of gun crime victims are known to or related
to the criminal, so your claim is wrong.  Now, since in 90% of all violent
crime, the victim is known to or related to the criminal, we obviously, by your
justification of reducing domestic violence, should ban steak knives, baseball
bats, chain, jacknives, the human fist, and cars.

No it is not, and the statistics of the FBI over the past 20 years expose your
mistake.

Since most domestic violence is not conducted with guns (while most women who
successfully defend themselves against domestic violence do so with guns), your
statement has no merit. Since a woman typically is physically overwhelmed by her
assailant, not giving her the ability to equalize the situation is merely
approving of domestic violence.

As a man, you would probably survive. If you were a woman, you probably
wouldn't. I seem to recall that Autralia has a higher level of domestic violence
than the US does....

Actually, in the poll I took last year, almost half of the foreign respondents
agreed, and either did posess firearms, or wished that they could but could not
due to government restrictions, while one brave soul kept one
illegally....because he lived in a neighborhood which was very crime ridden..

While this might be true in a country where the national sport is to get drunk
and beat your wife, it is not so here...and why prevent the wife from carrying a
gun just because her spouse is worthless? If he is that violent, he most likely
has a felony charge on his record and cannot carry a gun anyways....

There is no point to self defense if you do not have the ability to permanently
render the criminal incapable of causing further harm to you. If you merely
knock him out and tie him up for the police to get there, when they let him back
out on bail, he can easily come back and kill you.

Again, killing someone is not necissarily murder. There is a distinct difference
between the two, and I suggest you read up on before you continue arguing your
steadily weakening arguments... However, from Prof. John Lott's study, he found
that the death penalty had little or not influence on crime rates. While you
might say that it is because there are so few executions, you could also say
that so long as the execution cannot be made by the crime victim at the crime
scene, with their own gun, there is little deterrent effect.

On the contrary, a judicial system that is swift with minimal appeals, and
minimal ability of the defense to get off on technicalities is always much
cheaper than a large long overburdened criminal system, like we currently have
here..

Yes, but I would say that a large city, being a human hive, is really only
workable when the population is either ethnically homogenous, or has all been
lobotomized. And you are welcome to come visit me here in the 'Live Free or Die'
state, New Hampshire. I guarrantee you will not be the victim of any crime.

I don't think that's correct. In the ship reference frame, The ship gets no
heavier, and therefore needs the same power as measured in its frame to maintain
the 1 g accel as measured in its frame. I think the relevant formula is  f=ma.
In the earth frame, the ship is expending the same energy over a longer time and
is pushing a heavier ship. Its accel is therefore lower in this frame,
asymptotically approaching 0 g as v approaches c.

The practical problem is the source of energy and reaction mass. If you try to
carry your reaction mass, you'll need an unreasonable amount, even with a
matter/antimatter drive, which is the theoretical best for a reaction drive.
 ke=.5mv^2 is the energy you need to accelerate mass m to velocity v, but
e=mc^2 is the energy available in mass m, assuming all of it can be converted to
acceleration. But, you also need energy to carry the mass you will use later.
This is a losing propsition: read "The Physics of Star Trek" for a full
and fun treatment.

You can try to get around this by using a ram scoop, using a yet-to-be-developed
technology to sweep interstellar hydrogen from your path into your engines. This
is a bit tricky: don't try this at home. Read Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero" for a
good SF treatment of this.

Yes. In a situation between criminal and victim, the victim always knows who the
criminal is (he's the guy thats trying to kill or rob you), while a police
officer is trained to go into a scene expecting everyone to be the bad guy.

The story has always been badly misinterpreted. If the first two
pigs had been effective in turning away the wolf, the third pig
would not have had time to complete his house and the wolf
would have plucked him kicking and screaming from his half-built
house.

To stretch analogy far past its breaking point, we really need
society as a whole to keep on about its business while the
futurists work out how to make the transition to the posthuman
condition. In return for the service of maintaining society,
the futurists should try to help the remainder of humanity to
make the transition, not scoff at them as a bunch of clueless losers.

 yes, I tend to agree - I disagree that all gun carrying people would only
shoot "bad guys" - that's a hoot.
Hell, maybe I have just watched too much TV..
but I think people in general- armed for protection -  would be far more
responsible with guns (at least per capita- I don't have the "data" on this
but I remember reading something in the seventies - a researched psychological
profile about cops that suggested they weren't the best socially balanced
individuals.)
Plus the cops- just like the FBI and the Army,  have their "good ol boy"
routine - and a system of dont tell - they  hold themselves above the laws and
the citizenship and aren't as responsible for their actions as a private
citizens
(defending themselves) would be... 

So we better hope not only feds have guns!!

This does not mean I support an agenda that gun-activists seem to - which is
"more guns per capita" - I am still "anti-gun" - and would like to live in a 
gun-free society -  and I will never buy a gun under the social  conditions
and safety I enjoy here in Los Angeles (yeah yeah you wimps prolly think it's
dangerous, hear - go on, I was born in NYC -  and guns don't have much effect
on fires, landslides or earthquakes).  

 Still, I 100% support the right to own one, in fact you better - if you live
in a war zone like East LA or Harlem - or even if you feel  that way inclined,
even them good ol boy redneck racist fellas that like the NEA boys. 

They gotta find some way to feel safe while their little freakshow of white
suburban America disolves...

To say evolution must have been guided by some
sort of intervention or implied intelligence is
not an intelligent claim.  For this is to imply
purpose in both "evolution" and "intelligence."

So that would make new creationists far more
"silly" than the old skool type.

 agree- that is one of the basics of anarchist philosophy, isn't it?

There is a basic difference in choice,  other than a taxation bracket -
hopefully one you do not ignore. Republican vote often supports a whole
crapload of laws that deem the government able to regulate moral behavior,
pornography, school programs, sexual education, arts and entertainment
content.. the list grows daily...  religious freedom, soon...  maybe... (?)

This path does notdo not represent more freedom!
It just caters to certain interests more than others.. (yours...?)

You seem to be suggesting that they support a libertarian platform..  
They don't -  they merely mouth "lower taxes: less centralized government"
while stealing as much if not more (just from different areas) and directing
it covertly.

yes, but beyond the "PR" question,  in my mind, there is simply an adversion
to the whole survivalist meme, one post recently called the singularity a WOLF
- suggesting we are up against some kind of apocolyptic evil force, and like
pigs to be taken to slaughter - if we don't prepare for the worst - etc -etc- 

not all transhumans see the singularity as a bad thing, or even something
unnatural - surviving a day of surfing is way different than catching the
biggest wave and riding it with mastery.

You're confusing causative agents with simple correlation.  There are so
many possible reasons for the reduced crime rate in the rural areas
(ranging from differences in lead ingestion and fluoride concentration in
drinking water, to population density, socioeconomic indexes,  to gun
ownership)  that it becomes almost impossible to ascribe a causative
element to any one of them. 

I have yet to hear of any study which takes all other factors into account
to show a causative connection between gun ownership and reduced
crime rates.

I dunno if I'm a transhumanist...although I tend to have favorable attitudes
toward much of what I understand to be transhumanist.

But I'm looking forward to the "singularity"...I see it in a favorable light.
Either for me personally....or as a disaster for my enemies...either way a
good thing.  The Y2K bug possibly falls in a similar category.

Gerhard, 
sorry I don't have any statistics for you.
welcome to reality.
Inner city poems written by the kids I work with see it slightly differently.
If you have a gun, the crime still happens, but not to you.

Actually, because the houses of pigs one and two were so flimsy,
that the wolf lost hardly any time dealing with them. More importantly,
the wise no. 3 pig had planned well in advance, and had his house
ready on schedule, well before the wolf's campaign.

"The rest of society" isn't doing their "service" for *us*, just
like plants don't produce oxigen for our sake. Progress is a byproduct
of individuals' self-interest. Most people on this list already
contribute (more than) their fair share to society (either actively
through their work, or passively by consuming and paying taxes etc.), so
we don't "owe" sociey any more than anyone else. Most of us are already
spreading the meme whenever we can. It's out there. People can either
adopt or reject it, but that's *their* responsibility, not ours. And
yes, rejecting a meme that could considerably improve your condition
*is* stupid.

Besides, the influence of the futurist isn't *that* big. Society will
either destroy itself or succeed with or without their help, it's beyond
any person's or (small) group's control.

So, instead of worrying about society/humanity, we'd better worry about
our own condition first; that's where you can make the *real*
difference.

Absolutely right - it applies in the cities.  In fact, I wouldn't be too suprised
if gun ownership figures in NZ rural areas approached or even
surpassed those of the States. The figures you quote, however, still
show that gun ownership is 2X higher in the States. 

The point I'm making is that people don't choose to own guns for
'self-protection' - the guns are owned by farmers who go pig hunting,
deer hunting etc (which I wouldn't mind giving a go myself one day ...); ie
the reasons are recreational, not as a means to 'protect us from them'.

This is possibly the reason why gun ownership is not as high as in the
States; Kiwi's aren't as paranoid ;o), and the feedback gain is
subsequently lower.

Yes, we will probably be able to use a lot of that when we try to 
develop some good answers (say next week). What I have in mind is a 
general FAQ for transhumanism, which will have to be  somewhat 
different from an FAQ for cryonics or extropianism. Part of the 
result can then also be used to update the extropians FAQ, as Max 
suggests. For the extropian version we may want to modify some of the 
answers that deals with the political and economical aspects of 
transhumanism.

Its actually a libertarian joke. The other side of the joke is that a Democrat
is merely a Republican who has been laid off....  The two phrases are meant to
communicate that Dems and Repubs are just two sides of the same political party,
the pro-government-as-the-solution party. Fortunately, more and more libertarian
ideas are seeping into the less demagogic members of both parties. Watching
which libertarian ideas seep into which party is pretty interesting, and may
lead to a real difference in parties once again.

Aw, Nadia, now now. While suburban LA might be a freakshow, and to someone living
in the freakshows of any major metropolitan city in America might view our Norman
Rockwellian lifestyle as freakish, it is hardly dissolving. Considering that major
cities which are trying to redevelop their urban neighborhoods are latching onto
the 'urban village' concept, it seems to me that the tide is in the other
direction. As for the 'white' connotation, I am insulted and ask for an apology.
As far as I know, I have never uttered a racist comment on this list, and I resent
you trying to turn this conversation into a class/race conflict. That sort of
behavior is typically only practiced by democratic party operatives...

Exactly.  You will probably be surprised to
learn that this is precisely the truth; as 
compared to police, private citizens are
less likely to shoot innocents in a firefight
with criminals.

Here it is:

Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every
year (1,527 to 606).
 -- Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, (1991):111-116, 148.
(Professor Kleck, BTW, was an "anti-gun" social scientist who changed his
views upon uncovering statistics like this.)

And readers of Newsweek learned in 1993 that "only 2% of civilian shootings
involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error
rate' for the police, however, was 11%, more than five times as high."
-- George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards?," Newsweek (15 November
1993):93

Again, I return to the different contexts of gun ownership in societies that
have developed in a completely disarmed and culturally homogenous fashion and
those that have not.  If I lived in a society where no one else was armed and
I could count on almost everyone I encountered having very similar backgrounds
and values to mine, I would feel no compunction about giving up my own
weapons, aside from resenting the loss of the sporting aspect of shooting.
However, where these factors don't obtain, disarming myself seems foolish.
The attitude of people in such other, very different societies seems perfectly
understandable to me, and in the context of the relatively peaceful times in
which we now find ourselves, fairly rational.  However, I can't understand the
lack of imagination that seems to lead to a compulsion to export such ideas to
a place with a wholly different social context.

I've come up with my own memetic toolkit while fine-tuning my own skills in
discussing transhuman ideas, whether it is a one-on-one or public.  My own
toolkit is a first-hand, from scratch, and a blueprint that continues to
help me in spreading and engineering transhuman memes.


Natasha's Memetic Toolkit:

1. Listen
2. Discern Cost Benefit Analysis
3. Educate, Debate or Alienate
4. Employ Critical Thinking
5. Locate Common Ground of Interest
6. Present Historical Parallels
7. Practice Patience
8. Ignite Curiosity
9. Show Sense of Humor
10. Engineer a Meme 

FAQ:

1. Listen:  Understand the context of the people I am communicating with
and their level of progress and rate of personal growth. People will let me
know, one way or the other, within the first few minutes who they are.

2. Cost Benefit:  Discern if the time and energy is a productive and
successful exchange.  Is it worth my time and effort to communicate with
this person(s)?  (9 out of 10 it is.)

3. Educate, Debate or Alienate:  What strategy do I employ?  Am I in this
to teach, argue or to rave about my own views?  How do I best want to
communicate.

4. Critical Thinking and logically while monitoring information, getting
feedback, using error correction and accurate replay, and collision avoidance.

5. Common Ground:  If people recognize something in common with me (skiing,
videomaking, gardening, psychology), then I do not appear to be so alien in
my transhuman views.  

6. Historical Parallels:  people seem to be more receptive to new or
challenging ideas if they are given concrete examples of events in history
have some bearing on what we are discussing.

7. Patience: people develop at different rates, and this has value.  It is
a readiness and openness in someone's psychology that welcomes change.
Whether an early-bird or eleventh-hour, this process sometimes depends on
their psychological barometer.

8. Ignite Curiosity: "Every question we answer leads on to another
question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species."
Desmond Morris;  "I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a
fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be
curiosity." Eleanor Roosevelt. 

9. Humor!:  keeps tensions down, helps people relax, and there nothing so
welcoming as a smile.

10. Meme engineering:  My favorite moment is when I actively ignite or
impart a positive or vivid impression of my extropian ideas and transhuman
culture

	Cool!  So if you can harvest or collect the fuel and mass to
use for acceleration as you go this makes a difference from if you
start with your fuel and mass on board?

	I guess I should have looked that number up instead of just
pulling the incorrect constant 13 out of my head.  But at least you
knew what I was getting at.

	This can't be right can it?  It is possible to orbit around a
black hole isn't it, if you are far enough away?  And if you are at an
orbital velocity, then you'll be weightless right?  Or as if you are
not accelerating since the centrifugal force precisely counteracts the
gravity, at least outside the event horizon.  As you approach the
event horizon, the speed required to maintain enough centrifugal force
to counteract the gravity increases.  But, as long as one is above the
event horizon, the right sub light speed is all that is required for
this unless I'm mistaken.  It's my understanding that the definition
of the event horizon is the point at which the speed of light is
required to achieve enough centrifugal force to balance the pull of
gravity at that point.  I know you must at least be wrong with this
statement if you define "near the speed of light" as say a typical
speed for the space shuttle in low earth orbit and "just above the
event horizon" to be far enough away so as there is the same amount of
gravity pull as the shuttle would experience in this same low earth
orbit right?

	Or perhaps the "strained" you are talking about is that from
the force of the engines accelerating you to the speeds near light
required to keep you in orbit close to the event horizon?  But this
doesn't seem right either.  Doesn't something in a higher orbit
contain more potential energy than something in a lower orbit?
Mustn't one find some way to shed this potential energy in order to
move from a higher orbit into a lower orbit?  As in de-accelerate?
Which I guess causes a sensation of gravity just like acceleration.
But couldn't you maintain your descent, and shedding of this potential
energy at or under 1g all the way tell you get close to the event
horizon?  I sense I'm loosing my grasp on physics at this point, where
am I going wrong?  If this were all true it would be easy for someone
to get to the speed of light, at least in orbit around a black hole.
Or would it just take you forever to bleed off that much potential
energy at a constant 1 g deceleration and you would never reach the
event horizon before running out of deceleration propellant or
something?  I love the way friction causes a coin to stay in an ever
decreasing yet speeding up orbit in one of those charity thingies.
Couldn't you catch infalling interstellar hydrogen in you're
"interstellar equivalent of a ramjet"?

	It's very hard for me to grasp any significant objections so
many seem to have about transhumanism.  Some people seem to work off
of assumtions like there is absolutely no way for man to discover
immortality regardless of how much he progresses.

	Next, resurrection (or anything better) of those long since
dead, is so much more unimaginable.  And what good is a heaven without
our beloved deceased that gave us that heaven?

	The human psyche seems to have a fascination of "borg" like
stories.  This seems to feed on itself generating mems of abhorence
towards anything more than human.

	That's not 5, but it's a start for me.

Of course you can tell you're moving if you're in an accelerating spaceship

Well, they grow closer together.  But they don't individually flatten, they
undergo relativistic rotation.  This curious truth has been known since
1959, and is due to James Terrell of Los Alamos; I met it in Milton
Rothman's nice little book THE LAWS OF PHYSICS (Basic Books 1963).

    That's about 90% of it, yes.


>Individuals *can*, of course, have a code of ethics separate from the
group,

    And here's the other 10%:  Yes, you individually, and I individually,
ALWAYS
decide the ethics of an act on our own, even if we change our mind after
more consideration, or new info comes to light.

    I totally agree (at least in most cases, where immediate action isn't
required)

    However, the jury is making their own subjective judgement(s), even if
they all happen to agree. The result of thier decision making doesn't make
the act
OBJECTIVELY ethical or unethical (although the CONSEQUENCES of their
decision has objective reality, ie, the perpetrator going to prison).
     I *may* decide to grow an "illegal" plant, but a jury's subjective
judgements
may land me in prison, even though I feel it's ethical to grow a certain
plant.
    I may go to jail for helping a runaway slave in the early south, even
tho I feel it's
ethical to do so.
    I may shoot somebody in self-defense and go to jail, even tho I felt I
was
totally justified.

    In all cases, the jury decides in thier *subjective judgement* if I go
to jail, or
not.

    But all these decisions of the jury and myself ARE subjective
judgements, not objective. An objective judgement would be "I am sitting in
my living room", or
"This table is 4 ft high".


 A sociopath can't be allowed to harm whoever s/he
>wishes simply because s/he has a *different* set of ethical standards.

    Definitely not. That's why we have have juries & judges & arbitration.


>Likewise, a chronic *victim* cannot be allowed to gain by unfairly accusing
>others of harming them.  Both individuals may be acting ethically from
their
>frame of reference, but to use a phrase I've hear often lately... So what?

    So what, indeed. OTHER people (you and I) decide if and what actions
to take in the above circumstances.


>Ethical standards have little meaning if they are confined to the
individual
>level.

    Ethical standards have NO meaning if they are confined to the individual
level.
     Morals has to do with the individual level. Ethics has to do with how
we relate to others.

    But I don't think that's what you meant. I think you meant we can't let
people decide
"for themselves" what is ethical or not. But that's precisely what they DO
do.
The rub comes in when it's time for others to deal with those decisions when
acted
upon in reality. Then others can decide "for themselves" how THEY
subjectively
judge an act.


Anyway I still disagree with your original assertion at the top of
>this post:

    I'm assuming you mean this one: "Ethics and morals are totally
subjective."

    But you said this: "Yes, a better response to your original statement is
that
ethics are generally defined to be the rules of conduct (or the moral
percepts) of a
particular culture or group, and as such are understandably subjective."

>
>S.B.


    By the way, I take "Objective" to mean "existing in reality". I take
subjective to
mean "existing in the mind". So I do hope we're not working with different
ideas of subjective and objective.

Dwayne's chances of meeting this fate are far higher, apparently, in the

Title
  Biotin administration improves the impaired glucose
  tolerance of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats.
Source
  Journal of Nutritional Science & Vitaminology.  43(3):271-80, 1997 Jun.
Abstract
  The effect of biotin administration on the glucose tolerance
  of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Wistar rats was investigated.
  STZ-induced diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal
  injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg body weight as a single dose). The
  impaired glucose tolerance in response to an oral glucose load (1.8g per kg
  body weight) in STZ-induced diabetic rats (STZ-rat) was partially improved by
  intraperitoneal administration of biotin for 15 days (100
  micrograms/rat/day). However, a recovery in the STZ-rat's insulin secretion
  was not found after biotin administration. To help clarify
  the mechanism underlying the improvement in glucose tolerance seen with
  biotin treatment, glucokinase and hexokinase activities were
  determined in the liver and pancreas. In STZ-rats that had received
  biotin (STZ-biotin rats), glucokinase
  activity was higher by 3.4-fold in liver and by 2.4-fold in pancreas than in
  the STZ-rats. The biotin level of STZ-rats was significantly
  lower in the liver and pancreas than that of the control rats (no STZ
  administration); but in STZ-biotin rats, the level in these
  organs recovered to the control level. These results demonstrate that
  injected biotin can improve glucose handling without
  increasing insulin secretion in STZ-rats.

About a year or so ago I went and looked up a bunch of statistics on 
crime (I used a bunch of sources, but the most useful was a UN report, 
available online, which I can't seem to find at the moment). 

I was glad at the time that I wasn't looking specifically at the domestic 
violence figures, but rather at the murder rate, and total rate of vilent 
crime.  The domestic violence figures are a complete mess.  Comparing 
statistics for domestic violence across countries is pointless, because 
of differences in how frequently the crime is reported, and how 
seriously it is treated when reported.  

On a general note, I was interested to discover that the rate of violent 
crime seems to be fairly comparable in the US and Australia (within a 
factor of 2, depending on crime; also, I had to extrapolate because the 
figures I could find were all at least a few years old), but much lower in 
Switzerland. On the other hand, America had a far higher murder rate (~4 
to 5 times) than Australia.  Australia, in turn, stood in a similar 
relation to Switzerland.

I don't know why this is so.  Gun laws seemed the obvious answer to me, 
but a correspondent pointed out that only one quarter of murders in the 
US are done with a gun.  I didn't check the figure, but he's a reliable 
guy, and I assume he knows his stuff.  This fact does shoot a hole 
(couldn't resist, sorry :-) in my hypothesis.  I've been curious ever 
since why, even if you simply remove all the gun deaths by fiat, there 
are still so many murders in the US.

This wasn't addressed to me, but right at the moment, it sounds like very 
good advice, which I'll try to take in the interest of keeping the S/N 
high.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

This is my first real message to the list (ignoring that mail I thought I canceled).
I have been a life long extropian, but had not followed organized extropianism,
specifically, these transhuman and extropian lists, and the pages directly related
to them, until somewhat recently.

I have only been following these lists for several months, and I am sure that you
must have discussed these issues multiple times, but I have yet to become a direct
observer to one.  So now I will share my thoughts, doubts, and ideas on the subject
for any who wish to respond.  Any previous discussions I could search for in the
archives would also be helpful (i.e. specific thread topics).

I have, however, seen references to certain aspects of uploading and other related
topics in a number of discussions, and I am curious as to the popular opinion of
the list about certain aspects of the process, given the current knowledge/speculation
we have of it.

Since I have absolutely in no way had any first hand experimental experience with
how consciousness works in the brain or how it may be uploaded, I have only been
able to use logic throughout my years as a lone extropian to analyze the question.
So, I have settled my mind on a few logical variables.  The most important, to me,
at least, is whether a consciousness or 'self' will be *passed* in the process, as
opposed to a *new* one just being added.  Since, even though I like the idea of my
memories not being wasted, I'd much rather be there to utilize them myself.

So, if you will, allow me to analyze a few methods I've seen, or thought of myself
(not necessarily before anyone else did though,) for uploading.

All of these assume that 1) consciousness exists 2) the brain is the carrier/supplier
of consciousness 3) the brain does so through chemical and/or electrical means 4) we
have the ability to somehow manipulate this process to our benefit.

If I am wrong at all in my reasoning, please correct me.  That is the first reason
that doing this, to further my knowledge.  Other than that I am curious as to how
others logically back up the processes I see as improbable or impossible with my
current information.

Let me define up front what I will be *using* the term "original consciousness" or
"o.c." for.  First, I am not at all implying that this is, or should be the accepted
definition of "consciousness," 'original' or otherwise.  This is just *my* way of
saying "The Mind's 'I'" as it is popularly called.  The part of the mind that 'hears'
the songs 'in my head.'  The part that can recite poetry in an unspoken voice.
The part that people usually consider 'gone' when death comes (whether to another
plane of existence, to nothingness, or otherwise is irrelevant.)  The part of the
mind that enjoys things.  The part that is probably wishing that I'd just finish
this definition and continue the document. :)  The "original" in the term refers
to the consciousness we all have right now (assuming none of us has already been
uploaded?)  A second or 'n'th consciousness would be for anytime one can be called
my most 'conscious' after the first is lost either by death or purposeful upload.

'Total consciousness' is same as above, except stands for all consciousness-es a
person will have, summed together.  In other words, every time they awake and
think, it is still a part of the same total consciousness, even if the first
"I"(or original consciousness) died with the original body.

(Are there more accepted terms for these two states?)

Also, for a few examples, I am comparing multiple copies of people, (i.e. gene,
memory, personality, and other aspects important to being 'them').  If two people
have differing memories after a specified point in time (i.e. when the copy(ies)
is/are made) that is irrelevant to my comparison (except for a small part that is
irrelevant itself.)  If two bodies share the same original consciousness, they are
for the purposes of this discussion, the 'same.'  For example: My original
consciousness is gone when my total consciousness was uploaded into a new
body.  That new thing is not the 'same' as me, since "I" am now dead, even
though it has my personality, memories, etc.  "I" am no longer in control of it,
or aware of it's presence.  However, if "I" can control it, and am aware of it, it
is still me.

With this in mind, the questions of the 'o.c.' on it's transhuman journey now begin:

First, physical backup, using either true cells or mechanical devices of some kind:
*If the consciousness is both contained in, and produced by the cells of the brain*
(and is the reason you die if you do not get enough oxygen to the brain) one sould
be able to *logically* assume that:

1) If the cells are all taken away and the new system is implanted, that the
original consciousness *is* lost.  There should be no more reason for the original
consciousness to exist than there would be for a person 'a' to still be living
in an apartment after 'a' has been replaced by person 'b'.  The apartment may
still be a home (or the body may still have a consciousness,) but there is a new
'tenant.'

2) If the cells are replaced one by one (or slice by slice) the o.c. *may be*
lost.  Either the individual must sit there and slowly die, or the individual
will sit there and notice nothing (perhaps some odd, temporary effects, but
nothing serious).  (Just for completeness, a last possibility would be that
the process would interfere too much with the functioning of the brain to
be a viable form of uploading, but that contradict assumption 4)  If the
former is true, it should hopefully be found in the first the process is
perform on.  If he says, 'woah, I remember dying!' then that's probably a
hint. :)  That is, unless the whole this is a blur, and no one finds out that
they die until they try it...  Sounds like a bad sci-fi plot. :)  The latter way
should work.  To expound a bit: The only way that this would not work is
if consciousness could not expand to fit all the cells in a brain, which seems
unreasonable, especially in light of studies such as the one described at this
URL: http://neuronet.pitt.edu/groups/ctr-image/stroke1.html
I am sure that other type of studies have been made in this area that would
support this assumption.  The only possible hurdle would be if genetically
enhanced or mechanical cells were used, they would be ‘rejected.'  However,
there seems to be no logical reason (I am not knowledgeable in biology
enough to have any sort of authority on the subject, though) why the new
cells, or more easily, nanomachines couldn't, through certain chemical/
electrical functions ‘fool' the original cells into thinking that they are
normal, correct?  Still, I suppose that since the body isn't being replaced
in this case that it is a temporary solution.  So let's move on to more realistic
solutions.

3) If the consciousness is uploaded into a computer before it is uploaded
into a totally new body.  This would not work, using the specific assumption
of this section.  If the consciousness arises because of the actions of the
brain's cells, and is then contained within, there is no reason why it should
live in a computer.  A computer is, after all, just a processor of information,
at least until some drastic design change is made.  Of course, after that it
would no longer be a ‘compute'r in my, and I assume many other's definition.
Anyway, anything an electronic ‘compute'-er can do, a human ‘compute'-er
also can, with a good old sheet of paper (or a number of sheets), just much,
much slower.  Now, if consciousness can be understood to the point of it
being used in a manner such as uploading, it should be able to be computed.
Even if not, let us say for the sake of argument that it one day becomes so.
The man and the computer would both work out the same results of stimuli
as per that specific consciousness's personality and other factors.  So, the
consciousness would appear to exist, but would not necessarily exist.
Perhaps this could become an addition to Nietzche's "Baum der Erkenntnis?" ;)

4) Skipping the middle man, and using the method put forth in 2.  If, for
our example a mechanized brain will be used, an enhanced brain were
connected to the existing one, could the consciousness ‘transfer' to the new
brain as if it were a part of the old, even if only a part at a time?  For
example: the new brain only needed wires to connect it to the new body.
Nanotech machines are released along the wire and build the new brain
up from the wires, (which are inserted rather unobtrusively into the true
brain) replacing the original, through the cranium until it fully takes over.

5) Now, if 4 could happen, it's not stretching the concept too much to
say that one wire (‘a') could release machines of one device while the
other side (‘b') wire was constructing for another device.  When they
meet in the middle, both are removed, and ‘a's configuration was added
to ‘b's, and vice versa.  Hopefully the nanomachines would be able to
send this sort of information (configuration, chemical behavior, etc.) to a
computer or other storage medium also for backup, but immediately, for
the other side to use in place of the original cells to complete it's brain.

All said and done, two perfect copies would be made, and assuming that
all other assumptions made along the way were true, both should have
the original consciousness.  How this could actually work is another
variable matter... Both are new consciousness (seems unlikely),
one is the original consciousness, and one is new (but what would decide?
Also seems unlikely), the consciousness could not just handle the
process and would behave unpredictably when it tried to expand to
cover both brains(covered later), or the solution I find most logical (even
if not very natural seeming): That the original consciousness would control
both brains.  If the consciousness would expand to include the machines
as they took over, the process should continue until both devices meet
in the corpus collosum, where the o.c. is still controlling the brain as a
whole, even though it is but two devices communicating to each
other just as the lobes normally would.  Here a computer backs up
the information of both sides.  The lobes are then separated (each
respective lobe could be fed dumbbed-down reactions that the computer
is creating from the other device's backup, or even from the other device
itself, with wires connecting each other, and an area of nanomachines
used as ‘connections' to the lobe, passing the signals just as they
normally would be seen.  Both brains could then be constructed from
the device halves, consciousness filling in as brain progresses in
completeness.

About the conscious controlling two disconnected areas, I assume that
at least some of you are familiar with Roger Sperry's experiments with
the slicing of patients' corpus collosa.  If not, what happened was (don't
quote me): patients who suffered from extreme seizures had their corpus
collum, the connection between the lobes of the brain, severed, in the
hope that the lobe which fired during the seizure would not affect the
entire brain.  He had great success with the project, and much was
learned about how the individual lobes processed information.  However,
I remember a special I saw on TLC or The Discovery Channel, in which
patients who underwent similar (or the same) procedures would exhibit
conscious seeming behavior out of the person's control.  (A part that
really sticks in my mind is when they asked a woman who had the
treatment to point to ‘yes' or ‘no' on a large card, in answer to questions.
In some questions, no matter how sure ‘she' was, one hand would point
to ‘no,' even going as far as pushing the other hand out of the way, and
quite consciously doing as much as possible to point to ‘no,' even covering
up the ‘yes.'  Again, don't quote me on this, but that is what I saw.)
Perhaps other forces were at work, the cut was not preformed properly
 or a number of other things, but this worries me a bit.  I believe this had
to do again with the seizures, but I'm not sure.  This was an area I was
hoping someone more information in.  Any way, the corpus collosum
isn't really the sole connection which holds the brain together, correct?
(I'm not much of a brain guy, I do computers.)  So it's not necessarily a
true split.  Still, I see nothing that prevents this from happening so far,
and we are still operating under the assumption that the cells themselves
are the creators and holders of consciousness.  Something tells me that
a reply will have already proved me wrong by now, but I will press
on none the less...

This section deals with an area unrelated to the task at hand, and
explores some variations that could possibly be made if the above
is possible.  The chain of reason will continue again soon (it will
be commented as such.)  Now, if we can fool brain cells into
thinking that a robot mock-up is ‘one of them,' then we could
possibly have odd changes in the design of this receiver.  Perhaps
we could change around some x and y chromosomes and create an
opposite gender version of oneself...  I don't know what kind of laws
written or unwritten will be around for thing type of thing, but you
know someone is going to try it.  The o.c. controlling both a female
and male version of an individual would be.. odd, to say the least. 
How would any offspring be setup?  I would assume there would be
the problems that inbreeding would cause, or would it ‘transcend'
even that?  That's a topic for thought. Either way, something tells
me that experiencing the act from both sides at once would be
ostracized socially, as masturbation is now, though.  Besides that,
it's also adding the taboo of incest.

Off of that subject though, is a serious topic of debate.  If genetic
rearrangement, ala the previous example, is possible, would it be
permissible to augment one's appearance in an upload?  Most people
here would probably say yes.  Some would probably say that is required,
at least if one wanted a certain level of advancement (Two legs?  You
must be kidding!)  Consider also, though, that if this type of multiple
consciousness is possible, then someone could also have multiple
personalities.  This is not good.  Spies, hired killers, and a plethora of
other such positions would be made much easier by just splitting your
consciousness into a never-before-seen body, through genetic engineering,
or any other way of creating bodies different from the original.  This
new body could then kill all he chose to, and even if he died, it would still
leave the other portion(s) of the o.c., which can still resplit.  The
tech will probably be set up so that the typical hired killer cannot have the
tech to just ‘split' at will, but this can still be easily misused.  Also, it
should not be banned entirely.  If I cannot chose a body for upload, I should
still have the option to try out both and get a feel for each, though
this could perhaps happen by just trying one, then the other.  Besides that,
I would hate to have to have to deny everyone the ability to experience
two lives at once.  Could you imagine that?  That would be amazing.
Though I suppose that arranging the memories again would be a hard
enough ordeal to just leave it as an ‘interesting thing,' and there all the
memories would be lost, so what's the point... I suppose that if regulations
would be made, then it would just be easier to disallow it.  Total banning
may not be necessary, though.  Think about it... If someone is caught
after a murder or killed after a murder, you know with pretty much
absolute certainty who did it.  Their memories would show who they
were, since they'd still remember their original life before upload.  If
their memories were not uploaded (again, as shown in Roger Sperry
work, if the consciousness can't even access stuff with great certainty
from the other lobe of a possibly still partially connected brain, then
it certainly won't be able to from one being to the next.), then the killer
body would be nothing more than a personality clone, and the o.c.
would probably experience much mental turmoil, being possibly
120 years old in one brain and literally newborn in the other.  If they
could somehow manage with total amnesia in one of their bodies,
I believe that body wouldn't be enough of ‘the original' to have an
important connection, it would logically seem to cause a true
multiple personality disorder.  That leads into another interesting
area.  Since the memories of any body would slowly differ from the
other over time, wouldn't the same process eventually happen?  The
older an individual is, the less any memory changes what they have
believed since age 10 or so.  I.e.  between birth and age 10, every
day could possibly trigger a totally new way of thinking of the world,
but after age 15 or so, almost nothing will make you believe that a
certain race really *isn't* inferior to you, or that, if you think about it,
there's really nothing *wrong* with wanting to live forever.  However,
there is the possibility.  Many people here probably had such an
experience with Newtonian physics when relativity was introduced.  It
probably caused you to literally think totally differently about your
world and how you perceive it.  So, if one of my bodies was on a planet
around Proxima Centauri, and the other on good old earth, and the one
on P.C. talked to a real life extraterrestrial, wouldn't that cause a
severe clash in my mind's rendering of my bodies?  The earth bound
body would have no stored memory of the existence of those aliens,
and therefore would not believe in them, when "I", the o.c., knows
from my P.C.'s body that they exist.  The difference would be even
more drastic for someone such as our killer who didn't upload his
memories.  The new body might learn a lot about ethics as it gains
the knowledge to survive, such as realizing that killing causes things
to not survive, which is the most important thing to this body now.
The new body might become *opposed* to killing!

Although, I don't have to experience everything to know it.  If I could
somehow think in a certain brain at will, I could get those memories in
there.  Then again, how would either brain ever be able to do that? I
suppose some more research on memory would be helpful.  I suppose
it depends on how consciousness works.  If I can realize something in
one body, and rethink that in another, I can have the memory in both.
This could also be a sort of collective consciousness if more than one
consciousness could inhabit a brain (as opposed to the other way around
as I've been discussing.)

Now, back to reasoning the mind out of the brain...  If the
consciousness can be coaxed out of the brain into an electronic
device made of nanomachines, then, technically instead of hooking
them to a body, why not hook them to a computer?  It works now, since
there is a place for the reactions and electric functions to happen.  Just
all the stimulus is coming from computations in the computer... Here's
the chance for artificial reality.

So, if these nanomachine cells can emulate the original cells, then
shouldn't that mean that consciousness isn't technically in the chemicals?
Yes, this is pure speculation here, but so is the second of our assumptions,
that the cells are the cause/holder of consciousness, actually all four are.

So, if the chemicals don't necessarily make the consciousness, then
it's probably not the electricity either, since the nanomachines should
be able to be started again with no problems.  If it is the original spark
that is the consciousness, then everything stops here.  The machines
are turned off, but when they return, it is a new consciousness, just another
in t.c.., not the original consciousness.  Now, if I remember right, there
have been people that have been ‘brain dead' and come back, with the
help of shocks and things.  Does ‘brain dead' entail all action in the brain
ceasing?  Does the natural electricity change at ‘brain death?'  These
answers could help solve this part.

If all the above is true (working on four original assumptions (which
aren't IMO stretching it) and adding from there), then I have just
proven the original second assumption wrong.  (This is a mighty *big* if,
though, and I'm almost sure that I am wrong.)  However, if so, then
there is nothing making me "me."  I'm not sure if that's a soul or what.
Think about this, if it is just the setup of my brain, when given a spark
(or if it is naturally there from the mother) that causes ‘me' to be, and
if that *can be changed beforehand* by nanomachines that ‘fool' the
original cells into giving them the consciousness, what is stopping my
consciousness from forming in your brain?

I think it all breaks down in the question of ‘individual' spark.
Logically, from the information presented (which, unfortunately is not
all) that seems the only place where trouble could strike.  I really
need more info on the definition of brain death.

Well, I hope I get some replies (at least it will let you get your minds
off of gun control here for a minute or two.)  Maybe I even touched
on something no one had ever thought of before.  Maybe I blew the
whole "consciousness is brain reactions" thing out of the water.
Yeah, right.

Someone, please prove me wrong!!!

So, then, could random matter in the universe create another part of my consciousness?

There is apparently little reason to

Tidal forces would be a real problem.
The gravitational force that one side or

different enough from the other side or

No. I agree with that statement.  I was referring to your statement:

<<"What exactly makes something unethical is *your* opinion of the act, even
tho I may feel it to be an ethical act.">>

You yourself stated;

I do completely agree with you that ethical standards are subjective and
fluidic (real word?).  You give excellent examples of how an individual can
be incarcerated for offences that are considered innocent in a different
time/context.  So true.  I don't like the idea of only 12 people from *a*
particular area  judging my actions.  If I was on trial, I would rather have
it on the internet so that anyone and everyone could tune into the trial and
cast their vote.

Yes, we're using the same definitions. My main point was that in many if not
most  cases, it can be somewhat objectively determined (consensually)
whether one individual has been truly harmed by the actions of another,
whether it's physical, emotional, financial, etc.  I just started reading
_The Moral Animal_ so I'll let you know if I uncover any universally
applicable and objective moral principles derived via natural selection.

...sort of.    Life on this planet is about evolution or extinction.
Animals either adapt to their environment or die out.   So do cultures and
civilizations.   Human beings so far have managed to ride the wave pretty
well, creating artificial habitats in even the most unihabitable places.    We
"adapt" not merely through genetic changes, but also technologies...  from the
clothes we wear to shelter us from the cold, to the artificial hearts we get
to shelter us from the pork chops we love so much.    At one point, human
beings may have to decide how much change is enough, and that might be the
point humans choose between survival and extinction... fortunately, become
transhuman, in some ways may not only help preserve many of the things that
are human in us, but make the realization of certain human values, including
peace and co-existance with our fellow beings, possible in ways never before
imagined !

         >2. Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?
 
 Inhuman, maybe, but not inhumane.   Life is still a survival of the fittest.
Our weaknesses force us to war and compete, rape natural habitats and
considering our disposability engage in all sorts of dispicable acts.     We
live and die as animals, but dream like gods.     Isn't it better to aspire
for the latter ?

         >3. Isn't death part of the natural order of things?
 
And so is famine, disease and extinction.   Should we shut down all hospitals
and research centers to let life play itself out un-naturally ?
 
         >4. Won't extended lifespans cause overpopulation problems?
 
The universe is abundant in resources.   The development of transhuman
technologies assumes the development and manipulation of relative resources.
That's part of it, otherwise it simply wouldn't work.

promixr@ix.netcom.com, this is nothing against you personally...  You
actually reminded me of my suggestion.

Wow, I always hoped that if/when people could transcend the need to worry
about short life spans and technology advanced, that more time could be
spent expanding the horizons of art and creativity.

If that is the folk music of the future, I'd prefer the folk music of the
past any day.

>		Is is the driving, pounding soundtrack to the information
> age.

"Cheap, disposable, recycleable music" is exactly what we've had since
who knows when.  Many bands start making more complex or even just better
music just before they begin losing the skills they've just acquired, or
when their 15 min. of fame is almost up.  Transhumanism/the information
age should correct that, not perpetuate it.  IMHO, as always.

>	Passionate and dispassionate, pretty and sterile, virtual and
> virtuoso. Everything that technology promises to be.

Hrmm, I'll agree to an extent.  I don't see computers as pure number-
sifting machines who's only purpose is to let us become more lazy
(though, not implying that you necessarily do, either).  Perhaps since
I'll always be a game programmer (and a fantasy writer) :P at heart,
I cannot see such awesome machines in anything except the most 'creative'
light.  I consider this less the information age, and more the creation
age, at least after it gets going a bit.  The world still has a lot to
learn before we can can concentrate on leaving all the mundane number-
crunching office jobs behind and head towards invention, insight, and,
uh, innnnnterstellar transport, that'll work. :)

So, I suppose it's just those two middle adjectives there that get to
me. <shrugs>

I don't know about this though.  I mean, aren't we trying to get computers
up to our level so that we may surpass, not bring ourselves down to the
level of the machine to be left with straight computation?

I love the feel of being around hundred or thousands of others at a
concert hall.  Whether it be Bach or Ozzy, the music is very moving,
and the combined energy of the crowd accentuates that.  Just because
you are extropian, doesn't mean you can't use the help of others to
advance yourself.

On another note, the actual playing of an instrument can easily be much
more expressive than even the most advance sampling or MIDI.  That's why
such technologies are still so obvious when heard in music.  All the types
of sounds that can be produced by a violin or a guitar are uncountable,
if not infinite.  Many things are not even planned.  The way you pick
or bow a string can make an amazing difference in sound quality.  This
is especially noticeable with recorded music.  The same symphony can be
recorded with the same timing, the same positing, and even the same
instruments, but each's player's particular style of holding strings,
or blowing on brass, or if one accidentally bends strings when they hold
them, or the direction they point their instrument while playing, all
make a difference in a work.  It may not be noticeable to one not listening
intently, or even if only one person is playing, but when the whole group
has these minute differences, that is what separates performances.

I have many times played famous songs on the same guitar and amp setups
that the original was played on, and though I hit it note for note, none
has ever sounded *just* like the original.  I am more familiar with
the guitar, so I will stay here for a second.  The amount of the string
you are bending down with your finger makes a difference, if you bend
the neck, it makes a difference, if you pick the string parallel or on
an angle, it makes a difference.  Many things, like how you pull a finger
off a fret, that are not even thought about, make the largest difference.
Until MIDI can adjust realistically to all these variables, it still remains
"Cheap, disposable, recycleable music."  Even when it will take these into
account, only computers themselves will be sophisticated enough to control
all these variables.  So, then, it will truly be ‘uploaded,' but it should still
be anything but ‘Cheap, disposable, and recycleable.'  If I could plan out
all the little inaccuracies and unintentional extras, I would be in my creative
glory.  If ever such power were given to a machine, it would be a shame to
limit it to it's current standards of creativity.  I would love to hear the kind
of music a computer working off of an uploaded consciousness would make,
though.

Now that would be true ‘techno'

Special Relativity couldn't handle acceleration very well but according to 
General Relativity which Einstein developed about 10 years later there is no 
way to tell if you're in deep space accelerating at 1 g or at rest on the 
surface of the Earth experiencing the force of gravity.

If you went fast enough it would look like you were traveling down a pipe

Certainly during the inception of augmentation, only the rich will

As you should have guessed from my previous e-mail, I enjoy at least classical and
hard rock/metal.  However, it goes far beyond that.  I won't tell of much of it,
since if you already don't listen, you probably never will.

However, I have been wondering how many others on the list listen to power/
progressive metal.  Progressive metal is rather self evident to be at least
somewhat extropian.  However, power metal is on a different level.  Before anyone
says "bah, just noise, all of it."  You should really give some bands a chance.
Some of my favorite bands:

BTW, I'm not affialiated with any of the following, I just love their music.


Blind Guardian:  	 
	Their lyrics are far from extropian (focusing mainly on fantasy
fiction by the band and famous authors such as Tolkien), though some extropian
concepts slip in (i.e. songs inspired by books such as "Blade Runner/Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sleep?")  The extropianism comes in their music.  It is absolutely
amazing.  They started as a really good straight speed-metal band, but not many of
you would care about that.  Since their album "Somewhere Far Beyond," however, they
have adopted a sound that I've never heard in a band before.  They have very powerful
and fast music when needed, but also slower, acoustic numbers that have such emotion.
Another interesting trait is the giant choair-type vocals used in many a chorus.  If
you enjoy fantasy, or very powerful and heavy, but still emotional music, you should
at least try this band.  Unlike most sterotypical metal, they never hold back on
melody and harmony, but they also use a lot of time changes, which is what really
conveys the extropianism about it.  They are a truly difficult band to describe, since
they use rhythm, melody, and harmony so perfectly that they do not fall easily into
any category.  Their new album, Nightfall In Middle Earth, is a concept album
based on the first half of the Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien (the second half
will be continued on an upcoming EP).  To anyone who has read this, you konw how
much emotion is captured in this book - Blind Guardian expresses all the sorrow and
pain *perfectly* IMHO.  Also to any classical people, their solos and, now, a lot
of their base riffing are very classically oriented.

Great pages about them at: http://www.dd.chalmers.se/~f94jowe/bg/
		and        http://www.blind-guardian.com

For sound samples try: http://www.dd.chalmers.se/~f94jowe/bg/mmedia.html

	Of most apppeal to most of you would be the first two Real Audio files
			and the first three (second one is split) .mp3 files.

If any of you like them, don't hesitate to e-mail me privately, as I have another
six .ra files that cannot be found there (sorry, I will *NOT* copy CDs or portions
of CDs for anyone).

Their albums are now being distributed in the U.S. through Century Media, who
sells even imported CDs for very cheap ($10-$12 American dollars per CD, usually.)
However, they are rather slow (both in shipping time (2-3 weeks, usually) and also
in updating catalogs, so you will probably have to e-mail them about any Blind Guardian
CDs you would be interested in.  A bonus about Century Media is that there are many
great bands either signed or distributed through this label.  For orders over $80,
shipping is free.



Iced Earth: 
	This is a band that is acutally signed on to Century Media, so their
CDs are all $10 or $8.  Another band extropian in musical style.  Lyrics here
are mainly dark fantasy, though two notable exceptions are a musical journey
through Dante's "Inferno" and a concept album about the "Spawn" comic book,
hey, don't laugh, Spawn has a better, sadder plot than many books I've ever read,
certainly doesn't fit the name of "comic" book.

This band has a different sort of "atmospheric" quality than most of you are used
to.  There is a lot of fast strumming and time changes.  There is a wealth of
good music here.

http://www.icedearth.com has a lot of sound files (a good deal are temporarily down
due to server space.)  



Samael: 
	This band used to be straight Black metal.  Wait! Wait!  They've changed.
Just to let them make their own impression, their newest album is entitled "Passage"
and the cover is a picture of the moon.  How's that for extropian?  They are a
heavy, heavy metal, almost techno in parts, but with beautiful keyboarding all around.
Since the "Rebellion" EP, they have been quite extropian.

This is another band which needs to be heard to be believed:

http://www.invader.de/samael/

There is a sound sample here from the keyboardist/songwriter's classical remake of
	"Passage"
http://www.invader.de/samael/xy.htm

The sound sample here is not as demonstrative as some others would have been, but you
	can see the lyrics of some of their better material:
http://www.invader.de/samael/pass.htm

I'll leave you now with some quotes from Samael

"I know how little is the value of that which has a price."

" Profound is the pain from which is born deliverance 
  Long is the path which leads to the light 
  And you march alone ..."

" So small in my greatness 
  I am the one who never wanted to be 
  So great in my smallness 
  I am the one who knows he is not"

"I am my Savior"




Interview with Xy / Samael / Dortmund / Ruhr-Rock-Hallen / 01.06.1997
                    Invader, The Metal @-zine
"I don't want to change people anymore, you know, it's just... you just show some
ways. But you should not give like an exact way, you just show a direction which they will follow or
not, if they want to or not. But I don't think that you have to give them everything. So that's why there
are like a lot of different interpretations you could get from the lyrics, from the image of the band and
from everything. It's always like in-between, and that's something I like, because then people have to,
you know, make up their own mind, it's not something (so) precise where they could say: ‘OK, it's like
this'. They still have to make their own idea out of it, so...

Invader: So, is it like a sort of resignation about other people?

Xy: I just think the point is that if you try to change somebody and to force him to do so, that will
really never work. It's best to choose to show something, and then people change on their own. And
it's best that you don't really try to change them. They just make it in their own way. And then, the
change makes sense, because then they really change, they know why they change and, you know...
this is stronger, I think. 

Invader: So, it's still like: ‘Be your own god..'?

Xy: Yeah. Sure. But I think everybody should be, you know. It's just ‘follow yourself, because you've
got everything inside'. And you know everything. I'm trusting in that you're ... whatever. Then you
don't have to listen to what people say, you just listen to yourself, and that's it. But that's what
everybody knows but nobody practices. Most of the people know this, it has been told a hundred
times."

While I could not possibly argue with the "unhuman" point, I'm not sure I
see why living longer and better will make us less compassionate.  Why
would posthumans be any more or less heartless than they are today?

Nature only sucks if you define the natural to be 0% artificial.  While
this is a plausible definition, this also means that music and painting,
by their very definition, are "unnatural." 

Meanwhile, I happen to think that 100% artificial isn't a particularly
great way to go either.  The designed is not always better than the
emergent.  To the extent that spontaneous order is natural, nature does
not neecssarily suck at all.

So it depends on how you want to define nature.  By the most rigorous
standards, life extension is unnatural, but so is art, language and almost
everything else we get from human civilization.  All this shows is that
you cannot determine whether something is good or not by observing whether
it is natural, something we should have realized all along.

I'll strengthen that claim: an increasing population is going to solve
more problems than it causes until the universe runs out of useful
resources.  While no one can say when this is, it represents at least
several billions of years, if ever.

The clearer this is, the better:  There's no way to tell what our
technology and civilization will look like if and when we become
posthuman.  We can't even necessarily make scientific guesses about it.
No one has any clear idea at all.

#5 ain't so bad, except for those people who presume that if we don't know
then it must be bad.  #1 and #3 are basically the same question, which I
think can be made palatable when we show that a rigorous definition of
nature is a silly idea.  I completely disagree with #2.  So we're not
doing half bad here.

OK, I've got to butt in here.  Philosophically speaking, you're making a
rather lofty presumption which you have not at all defended.  There are a
large body of philosophers who claim that we can rationally determine what
we ought to do, and thereby solve the problem of ethics.  I find this
position rather strong, since it seems to me that one cannot rationally
disprove this, except possibly by showing how rationality cannot be used
to make choices, an absurd claim.

Have you uncovered something that rational moral philosophers haven't?

Why not?  I'm struggling to deal with this topic in my book abt prolonged
longevity, and I don't know what to think.  If you assume that women run
out of eggs at menopause (having been shedding follicles at a humongous
rate since around conception), it mightn't make any difference if they
lived forever thereafter using what amounts to HRT + nanobots - well, aside
from the sheer increasing mass of un-dead remaining on the surface instead
of declining gracefully under it.  But if you can fiddle with cells, you
can presumably kick-start your tired stem cells if you get the urge for
another kid (and they're *just so sweet*).  And even this leaves out the
possibilities of uploading by preference to bio-living, cloning in vitro
for 9 months (no pain, just gain), all that.  But if rejuvenated people
felt the urge for a new family every 50 or 100 years (as mid-life crisis
men seem prone to now), this would surely have a terrific demographic
impact.  Alas, I'm no good at doing this kind of thing on my fingers and
toes.  Any numerate speculators out there?

Actually, I find this dubious.  If I am playing Bach's "Goldberg
Variations" on my CD player, and then remove the CD and replace it with
another identical one, is the same music being played?  Yes.  The CDs are
different, but the music is the same. 

Similarly, if I replace all of your cells with cells which act just like
your cells, then perhaps I am doing the same thing as switching the CDs.
There is no externally observable difference between the music on the two
CDs; there would be no externally observable differences between your
consciousness before the experiment and whatever was left. 

We cannot determine whether your consciousness would remain intact by
experiment, or even thought experiment; if we are not feeling it, we can
only presume that consciousness exists when we observe intelligent
behavior.  Since the behavior would be the same, however, by that same
presumption we must conclude that the consciousness would remain and would
be the same.  If this presumption is not true, then we cannot presume that
anyone else is conscious either, because we aren't them.

Since we can and do presume the existence of consciousness which we don't
feel based on observed behavior, and since the observed behavior would be
identical, we must conclude that the consciousness would be identical.

Sorry, I think I've confused matters here.  Rothman put it this way:

`This new interpretation of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction does not
change the basic theory at all.'  I.e., things still contract relative to
each other.  But: `travellers whizzing by a star at relativistic speed will
see not a foreshortened spheroid but a sphere, which will seem to be
rotating so that they can briefly see its far side!'

There is a lot of things pointing in that direction.

1) Basically well-educated people get fewer kids. People living for a LONG
time will most likely be well educated.
2) Rich people gets fewer kids.
3) People living for a long time will be wise/intelligent enough to not have
too many kids.
4) People who expects to live for a long time will get their kids a lot
later. They will wait until they are well of and can take 10-20 years out of
their schedule to take care of the kids. Thus slowing down the reproductive
cycle.
5) People having kids that have kids that have kids and so fort, make the
populace grow at an exponential rate. People having a lot of kids but at a
slower rate doesn't grow the populace nearly as fast.

Well these are some reasons at least.

Rather than simply raising questions, I guess I should add some more to the
discussion:

[NOTE: *please* do not quote this rough-draft passage off-list without
explicit permission]

===============================

The HU-GOO catastrophe?

Here's the worst and most ironic question of all: would a true immortality
treatment, emerging as a spin-off of the HUGO Project, telomerase
investigations, or some other deep life sciences research effort, unleash
the world's worst plague - an unstoppable tidal wave of endlessly
reproducing human beings?  It is all very well to mouth wishful platitudes
about human intelligence and foresight, but those great gifts have let us
down in the past, at least some of the time (although we're still here,
despite owning nuclear and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction for
over half a century).  At other times, coupled to devotion, courage, honour
and love, intelligence and foresight have been our salvation and our glory.
 Tangled through every fibre of human choice, however, is our deep-grained
inheritance as the children of four billion years of driven replicators.  

Any one of us can overcome, at least for a time, those inarticulate urgings
and imperatives coded into our bodies by survivor genes.  Any of us is able
to delay parenthood for years or decades past the dizzying adolescence when
Homo sapiens reproductive programs kick in with their wild hormonal songs,
their heartbreaking melodies of loneliness and yearning.  Any of us, given
sufficient motivation, can choose a life path without any kind of
parenting, or indeed any sexual expression at all - there are many
voluntarily childless heterosexual people, gays, celibates, paraphiliacs
with interesting tastes that preclude reproduction.  But not all of us can
deny those urging all the time - and it will be impossibly harder, perhaps,
when we literally have all of time.  

China has managed for two decades to restrict most couples to bearing only
one child, within marriage, using an authoritarian and quite brutally
invasive policing mechanism.  Still, many Chinese citizens break the rules
and have more than the one authorised `little emperor'.  (Many of the
little empresses die young, notoriously, which does show in a gruesome way
that people can deny one of the most powerful instinctual drive even as
they pursue the satisfactions of a related cultural pressure.)  So what
will happen if people learn to live for centuries or millennia, retaining
all the fertility and juice of healthy young adulthood?

Here's the worst and most ironic answer of all.

The world would be swollen with hungry human mouths very quickly, by
evolutionary measures, even if women only had a new baby or two every 20 or
even 50 years.  The most prodigious and Promethean technologies might find
it impossible to meet our collective appetite for energy, raw materials,
living space.  Nanotechnology will make the driest deserts bloom, honeycomb
the mountains, fill the oceans with self-sufficient artificial cities and
the skies with geodesic homelands kilometres in diameter - but sooner or
later, even with cheap transport off the planet and into the asteroids, a
planet's worth of always-fertile immortals will choke Gaia's life-support
systems, or go haywire into lethal carnage.

So, at least, it might seem.  Malthus, who long ago forecast overpopulation
doom, would prove to be the bleak prophet of utopia.

	The new population bomb

Dr George D. Moffett's authoritative Critical Masses notes that in the
mid-1990s world population was some 5.6 thousand million, and expected to
double by 2035.  (By July 1998, according to the US Bureau of Census, the
global figure was estimated at 5,927,383,121.)  In fecund Africa, doubling
times are half the global average, and numbers would swell from 670 million
to 1.4 billion by 2015.  At some point, it was hoped, the most struggling
nations would attain sufficient economic prosperity that women would move
into `replacement fertility', stopping at no more than the two surviving
children needed to replace her and their father(s).  Yet population
momentum would slow the impact of that transition.  Two out of five humans
in the poorest countries are under 15, readying themselves to add to that
huge bulge.  Strikingly, while Japan reached replacement fertility as long
ago as 1957, its population would take half a century to become stationary
(zero population growth) in the early 2000s. 

And the world as a whole is nowhere near replacement fertility: the current
level is four surviving children for every couple.  Not even the appalling
epidemic of AIDs will scythe that swelling human harvest.  `Even with the
projected losses,' Moffett notes of the plague, `population growth rates
will remain high and population doubling times will be increased by only a
few years.'  On the other hand, if heterosexual people most at risk of AIDs
in the Third World adopt condoms as a protective measure, that might in
turn reduce runaway overpopulation.

So what happens if science extends life span significantly?  Even
`replacement fertility' would be excessive for a groaning planet, since
those ageing adults whom the new babies were meant to replace will still be
alive and kicking, consuming, polluting with their energy demands, and
perhaps making even more babies.  Prophets of population doom like Paul and
Anne Ehrlich might be proved right after all.
		
	The population prosperity engine

Is it true, though, that the new demographic transition into extended or
rejuvenated life would have such terrible consequences?  Optimists such as
the late Julian Simon, a professor of business administration, argued
vehemently that economic growth in human societies booms alongside
population increase, without leading inevitably to resource depletion and
environmental degradation.  How so?  Because we are cumulatively
intelligent creatures, whose cultures learn new and more efficient ways to
shape the materials of the world to our needs.  Once, we were obliged to
accept only what came our way from Nature's bounty; then we learned to draw
abundance from the land; now we build altogether new materials.  Every year
we work smarter and cheaper, with wealth increasing for all (for some much
more than for others, it's true) as market signals enable us to maximise
our productive powers.

The tragedy of ageing and death is that so much human effort and resource
is expended in education and training that's inevitably lost within a
couple of decades.  Only genetic memory is transmitted more or less
unblemished down the centuries, the millennia.  Yes, cultural memory is
compressed, shared, committed to writing and other external storage media -
but its fine-grain detail perishes, in large measure, with every human who
falls.  We pour increasingly greater quantities of treasure into teaching
first the fundamentals and then the sophisticated expertise of a thousand
trades and professions and, in each case, within fifty years that treasure
is wasted in death.

Suppose it need not be that way?  Suppose the accumulated knowledge and,
better still, the hard-won wisdom of the years were retained - not in
written summary, not in tales passed down from parent or tutor to child,
but in the canny brain and sinews of a vastly long-lived adult?

	The dead hand of the past

Or is this, in turn, a recipe for crushing stagnation?  As things are
today, technical knowledge doubles even faster than human numbers.  The
fresh young minds of children are specially structured to take in
tremendous amounts of raw and processed information, to learn new words for
new ways of looking at the world.  An entire generation of researchers
struggles for decades to create an impossibly difficult innovative way of
perceiving physics or chemistry or economics, and a pristine intake at
college effortlessly gulps down that shocking paradigm shift and moves
forward creatively, within what seems to them the most natural perspective.
 Science advances as the old bulls weaken and retire.  So what happens when
the old no longer weaken, when nobody is obliged to give up tenure due to
physical exhaustion and slow mental decline?  Is this not a return to the
grim days of repressive priesthoods and principalities, when opinions are
set in concrete and no disruptive new angle on the world is permitted to
ruffle the timeless surface of The Way Things Are Meant To Be?

Certainly that is a risk.  It is not, though, a very persuasive picture, I
think.  Julian Simon's market forces would surely step in to topple a rigid
gerontocracy, as they are doing now in China.  If the old refuse to learn,
they surrender possession of the finest novelties to their rivals.
Knowledge is indeed power, and new knowledge brings surprising access to
new power.

Besides, must an ageless gerontocracy be rigid in this way?  It is too
early to know, but we might be taking a false logical step in assuming that
the old in a deathless world must automatically resemble today's crusty
elderly.  One reason older people today tend to cling to views acquired in
their own youth and early maturity is that the brain literally gives up its
plasticity.  The neural wiring is trimmed from the earliest months and
years like a manicured topiary bush, shaped by each child's environment to
create an adult well adapted to a certain historically contingent time and
place.  Eventually that specialisation - with its concomitant loss of
flexibility - hardens into place as the ageing brain suffers damage.
Neurons tangle in plaque, dying and not replaced.  Yet this physical
deterioration is precisely what an immortal generation will need to halt in
order to forestall death.  Telomerase therapy, even nanotechnological
machines like hordes of clever benign viruses, will maintain the repair and
health of neurons and their vast network of knowledge - indeed, of
self-awareness.  If mental rigidity is a risk for the deathless, it will be
a psychological rather than physiological hazard, the kind that already
afflicts `young fogies' who choose to squeeze their eyes shut in the face
of novelty.

	Hope I die before I grow old

For all that, the political consequences of massively extended youth might
not be comfortable.  On the one hand, a world in which everyone retained
the piss-and-vinegar zeal of adolescence, in which male `testosterone
poisoning' was never quenched in the hormonal ebbing of late adulthood,
might be an alarming place to live.  I suspect this risk can be overstated.
 Even diehard criminals in their late 40s or 50s are physically strong
enough and brutal enough to maim and kill their foes, but it seems that
they often mellow with experience.  Times simply teaches us lessons of
prudence that the innocence and ignorance of youth cannot know.  Happily,
we also learn `people skills', learn to ignore the foolish herd-mentality
of the young, learn courage in taking chances that once might have frozen
us solid in terror of imaginary consequences.  To retain those skills in a
body unhurt by the years - ah, `Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive,' as
Wordsworth did not quite say, `but to be old was very heaven!'

Damn, that explains all those thousands killed in arguments in Florida

However, reality doesn't care what you think. Go and read some criminological
research on guns and violence (a quick web search for "Gary Kleck" and 
"Point Blank" will give you most of what you need).

I'd be interested to see those historical statistics you're talking about; 
those I've seen showed it was about as safe as Europe today.

In that case, perhaps you could give a real, actual, example of a terrorist
group who are attacking a government for being *too free*, and who are not
government-funded.

The only example that springs to mind would be Islamic attacks in Egypt,
but I'm not sure that they fit into that category since I know little
about the situation there. Also they seem to be targetted at visitors,
not the locals, which complicates matters.

Yes. This is one reason why government is bad and should be eliminated.

My conception of individual rights does not include a government, so that's
not a problem.

And I still disagree with this "inner party"/"outer party" stuff. If you
think PR is bad when people know what you think, just imagine how bad it
will be when the media is full of stories about how Extropians have one
set of opinions for newcomers and a different set for 'initiates'.

I think the actual issue is whether extreme longevity will change the
situation. consider te following two scenarios:
 1) each woman has four children at age twenty (average) and dies
as age forty, men die at forty.
 2) each woman has a child every twenty years. Men and women are immortal.

I think the population curves are identical.

conclusion: we have an overpopulation problem to solve in either case.

This question occurred to me as well.  If the questioner means *Will we
become inhumane?*, I have to ask *Inhumane to who?*  I imagine there will be
a sizable segment of the society that will turn down the opportunity to
transmogrify (real word?) into a posthuman.  How much compassion will we
have for these humans once we've evolved?  Well, if it ends up being as big
of an evolutionary leap as I expect it to be, we probably won't act in an
inhumane way toward them as much as we will simply be disinterested.  How
much compassion does the average human currently display for apes?  Yes, we
protect them and study them and are even occassionally entertained by them,
but by in large we're just too engaged in human activities to be very
interested in what they're doing.

If the questioner means *Will we become inhumane to each other?* . . . hmmm.
I think it more likely that we will become posthumane.  I believe that
transhumans will communicate on levels beyond most people's imagination.
With better communication will come better understanding which leads to
greater empathy and compassion.

I think it would be more persuasive to point out that for many organisms on
the planet, death is not a natural thing at all (e.g. cancer cells, amoeba
...I think).  Death has certainly been instrumental for the purposes of
natural selection (I know, I know...natural selection *has* no purpose), but
we're no longer obeying the laws of natural selection anyway (are we?).
Point to the growing opinion among those doing research in the field that
aging appears to be encoded at the cellular level and it's likely we will
eventually find the means to gain control over the internal clock.

Probably will.  If I know human beings, we won't solve this problem until we
absolutely have to.  The thing is, this is going to be a problem we're going
to have to face with or without transhumanism. It's just a matter of the
time scale.

Well, I said at the start that ethics was not my field.  Thanks for butting

This would only be so if the gravitation field of anything was uniform.  Ergo,
only if you measured gravity at one point on Earth might you think it was
equivalent to a 1g acceleration in a spaceship.  If you measured it at two
points on the Earth's surface, you would notice, provided your instruments
were very precise, that the direction of force converged.  In a spaceship
the force's direction at two separate points on the same surface (that was
orthogonal to the direction of acceleration) would not converge.  (This is
all assuming space is locally flat.:)

New Zealand, to the best of my knowledge, was settled by white
people, as well as having a fairly numerous native population. It
was a destination for transportation.

Australia was settled, originally, by convicts, yes, but that
ended a very long time ago (although it is useful for ignorant
foreigners to trot out on occasion as some sort of point-scoring
token), and more than 50% of the current Australian population
was born overseas. Stereotypes are occasionally useful, but they
need to be correct to be so.

Reminds me of an old Steven Wright remark which went something like:

 *I came home to my apartment yesterday and realized that someone had
replaced everything I owned with an exact duplicate.*

I think this notion of *It won't really be me.* is a tough one to deal with.
Consider the following scenario:

You go to sleep one night, and I make an exact duplicate of you then destroy
your original body.  Is it still you when it wakes up? It will certainly
believe it is you.

(Remember when Jeff Goldblum was transported across pods in *The Fly*, and
then said to his baboon friend, *Is it me or is it memorex?*)

Now answer the following:  If I don't make a duplicate, is the person that
wakes in the morning an exact duplicate of the person that went to sleep
last night?

I think you'd have to say no.  Some cells multiplied, some died, dendrites
changed paths, and you're not nearly as sleepy as you were.  The change may
be slight but you're not really the same person as you were yesterday.  The
change is far more observable if you compare yourself now to yourself 20 -
30 years ago.  But that doesn't seem to bother any of us because the change
is so gradual.  Glaciers don't seem to be moving either.

If I told you when you were 20 that I was going to turn you into the person
you would be when you were 40, you would probably feel like you'd be losing
more than just time.  Seems like most of us are are burdened with the notion
that there's something immutable that represents our essence (the soul meme)
which will be lost if we are uploaded.  It's my guess that there is no soul
and that there's precious little if anything about you that is constant and
immutable.

BTW, this isn't just an uploading question.  Other transhumanist-related
alterations in our physical and mental make-up will force us to ponder the
same thorny question, *Will it still be me?*  Probably not, but the *you*
that you're trying to save is more illusory than you imagine.  Bottom line,
eventually no matter what you do, *you* are not going to be *you* anymore.

S.B.

Do you have any references for any of this information? This is
something I have been interested in for quite some time, but
wasn't aware that people had actually done any work on it.

This is an extremely good and valid idea.
however, the practicalities of communicating effectively over
intercontinental distances make such a network reasonably
expensive, and also, if the balloon really DOES go up, you'd want
to be careful that you aren't targetted by surviving military
elements zeroing in on your signals.

Well, this is also a practical idea. But you're advocating a

Isn't this a private list? It's not a newsgroup. I'm not a member
of the Extropy Institute, mainly because I can't afford it. What
would happen to me? Would I be excluded? I would suspect that if
someone who strongly disagreed with the issues discussed here
came along they'd just get bored and unsubscribe. It's not like
we're all columnists in a newspaper...

I haven't had a chance to read the other replies to this, because of the
holiday weekend, but I wanted to drop a quick line before going to the
office, to respond to his frustrations....

I think it's a bit premature to bemoan to greater image of an area of
thought of which, at the most, five percent of the world's population is
aware of the existence.  We haven't even yet fully defined among ourselves
what transhumanist thought 'is', what it means to everyone individually and
collectively.  FM wrote his book on the transhuman only nine years ago!  The
network of thinkers that has developed in such a short span  predicts an
exponential growth in future, if we can provide the infrastructure for such
growth.

As for the response of others, name me one truly revolutionary set of ideas
that was taken seriously in its beginnings!  I fully expect a backlash
against our ideas over the next ten years, because they threaten many groups
of people who up until now have been allowed to go unchallenged.  I would be
more worried if there were no reaction, because that would indicate a
complete lack of originality on our part.  Our advantage is that we are all
(hopefully) engaged in longevity programs and so will be able to enjoy the
benefits of greater acceptance in youthful fashion down the road...!  How do
we gain that acceptance?  By moving en masse into the teaching, publishing,
research and business positions that will compel others to at least pay
attention.

At this point, the most positive venue, and the most promising avenue for
memetic expansion, lies in publishing.  I have more writing assignments that
I can keep up with right now, just for waving transhumanist ideas in front
of an editor. It's fresh, it's new, it's cutting edge....

TC,

Anyone who relies on the bible, either in translation or in the

Depends on how you did it, I guess. But this is a spurious

not.

That's nice. Meaningless, but nice.

I've been attacked. I've had a gun pointed at me. In this
instance the trigger was pulled. Carrying a gun wouldn't have
made any difference. I have undergone quite extensive martial
arts training and am more than  match for any two or three
attackers from the general public. -This- to me, is a far more
useful ability than the ability to carry a gun. It's highly
unlikely I will accidentally kill someone with my bare hands.
Possible, yes, likely, no.

You seem to feel that you have the answer. You have an inability
to consider the possibility that other people could be right.
I've been attacked. I've had a gun pointed at me. I thought I was
going to die. I'm not a christian. Yet I still think your pro-gun
attitude is foolish and dangerous. 

I'm not opposed to self-defense. If I were to kill someone while
defending myself, I would consider that justified. This is
something I am more than capable of doing. But I would like to
have the choice as to how far I am willing to take a given
situation. The problem is that using guns very very quickly
escalates either a simple robbery or a simple assault into a
life-or-death situation.  This, to me, is the tragedy of the
pro-gun stance. things just rarely get so serious as to warrant
killing someone. I do *not* believe that you are justified in
killing someone to protect your property. It's just stuff. People
are more valuable than that.

The thing is, if I wanted to, I could very easily go and buy a
gun illegally. No one would know I had it. I could keep it at
home for use when needed. But I do *not* think it is justified,
as I live in a country which has enough sense to not give it's
members the capability of being armed to the teeth.

I was subscribed to this list quite a few years ago.  Back then,
it was an enormously stimulating list full of very clever people
and incredible discussions. Now, it seems to be a libertarian
stalking horse, when there are more extropian topics to discuss
than bogus libertarian political philosophy and gun ownership.

It seems almost a given here that libertarianism = extropianism.
Is this the case? I thought extropianism was about transcending
our current limitations and pushing the human potential to it's
utmost.

I was of the understanding that most people were killed by their
own guns.
Even so, this is a possible 30% of all victims killed by guns who
could have survived.

Are you stupid, unable to follow a thread, or just trying to wind
me up? I have repeatedly stated that I think weapons which kill
at a distance (guns) should be banned. I have also repeatedly
said that I don't think "anything dangerous" should be banned,
merely the most dangerous weapons (guns and more dangerous
weapons).

This is *so* annoying. In fact, in cutting down the size of my

offensive manner, which was:

How so? The fact that -some- domestic violence is conducted with
guns (as you imply) suggest that there *are* cases of domestic
violence which involve guns. Which is my point. Although *my*
point was about violence in general. *You* reduced it to domestic
violence, and further reduced it to domestic violence between a
man and a woman.

Using a gun against an unarmed person in no way equalises the
situation. It merely reverses the situation.

light. I am rarely physically cowed by someone because of my
training. I don't feel that I need a gun to defend myself. Your

Because I *KNOW* that on the whole, no one I am going to meet

While I in no way support men beating their wives, or anyone
beating anyone, for that matter, I don't feel that beating

This is bullshit. The point of self defence is to defend
yourself, not to cripple the opponent. Have you actually
undertaken any self-defense training? Were you told this?

Wow. I am so glad I don't live in your world. I was attacked by
six guys once. The police arrested them later. They went to jail.
I have never seen them since. If I were to see them I seriously
doubt they would bother me, having already been to jail for doing
this. Given that, in this country at least, you don't have to
publicly state your name and address in court, I'm not sure how
anyone *could* "easily come back and kill you".

Also: unless he has a gun, how could he "easily come back and
kill you" at all? Didn't you knock him out the first time?
Couldn't you do it again?

This is possibly true as a historical fact, but I would say it
has more to do with the fact that we haven't yet sorted our
social problems out adequately (which is, I assume part of the
reason why this list exists) than that it is completely
impossible for humans to live together en masse.

I'm perfectly happy living in Australia at the moment thank you.
I am planning on spending some time in the US in the foreseeable
future, but where I locate will depend on who I know, not crime
rates and gun ownership.

It astounds me how easily the pro-gun, pro-liberty lobby is all
in favour of massively increasing the power of the state (reduce
appeals, introduce capital punishment etc) when it suits an
argument and yet is allegedly vehemently opposed to government as
a matter of principle.

Indeed; government is by its nature very unstable, and that's another good

Fine; you can think what you like, but reality doesn't give a damn about
"should" or "should not". If they wish they're free to stay there and 
die in defence of their beliefs, but they'll die just the same.

Again, the question isn't what you think, but whether you want to live or

Who's running from the problem? Those who stay behind because they "shouldn't"
have to move, or those who move because they recognize that it's the only
solution? Politics will only make the problem worse, not better. And you 
don't "allow it to exist"; it exists, whether you like it or not.

Of course; much better to increase that motivation and stand behind your
beliefs that people shouldn't have to get nuked for it. They'll be real

Uh-huh... and that won't destroy privacy? Being subjected to arbitrary
searches and scans by the cops, which will very quickly be expanded to
include anything else they can scan for? And what will you do when the
freedom fighters take that as an incentive to strike now?

My experience online seems to suggest that americans tend to
react to disagreement far more aggressively than europeans. Media
portrayal tends to support this. Maybe americans overreact in
arguments to such an extent that people get violent?

Note that this is based on the interactions I have had online. I
haven't been to the US, although a friend has just moved to
Boston from Melbourne and he said that americans seem to be
"drama queens" compared to what he is used to here, in other
words they dramatically overreact in a given situation. This was
his response when I asked him if there was much difference
between Melbourne and Boston, so it seems to be what struck him
as the most obvious difference. He's been in Boston for about 18
months now.

Anders and Greg have hit squarely upon a key challenge. Namely, "What is the
most efficient way to spread extropian / transhuman memes"? I've often
wondered how many people have unsubscribed from the various incarnations of
this mailing list when shouting matches erupted. Or how many times people
who call themselves extropian have found themselves turning off someone to
extropian ideas after a heated, face to face, full blown argument, not
because their arguments were unsound, but because they attempted to "convert
an umbeliever" by drowning them under a tidal wave of every extropian /
transhuman meme all at once.

Far better to win mindspace    one    rationally    argued   idea    at    a
time.

One question I have of transhumanism, which I sent to Nick Bostrom as 
part of his email survey, is to ask how revolutionary transhumanism is?  

If you strip away the details of the transhuman technologies, 
some of which are truly revolutionary, in many (not all) ways it seems to me 
that the core transhuman philosophy is a natural progression from 
earlier ideas.  Some time back I asked myself what was especially new 
about transhumanism, and was quite surprised by the answers I came up 
with; I highly recommend going through the exercise.

(Just for fun, I'll answer Kathryn's challenge: quantum mechanics, 
special and general relativity, the theory of evolution, Newton's laws of 
mechanics, Turing's theory of computation, Goedel's incompleteness 
program :-)

Kathryn Aegis <aegis@igc.apc.org> wrote to the Extropy List:

Indications are that many people who intended to see this movie have indeed
done so, and I will now share my thoughts on it.  (Warning:  contains a
multitude of plot spoilers)  

Many of the subtexts within this movie merit discussion in other forums:
media manipulation, privacy, dissent within a mass culture, allusions to
Hamlet and Homer.  One subtext, corporate control of a human life, may
relate to the cloning discussions that took place here many months ago;  I
would like to see someone address that if it interests.

The transhumanist aspect of this movie that completely hooked me early on
and let me identify with Truman was the way in which Truman's life was
controlled through the use of manufactured limits, and the methods by which
those limits were incorporated into Truman's psyche.  To keep him on the
island 'voluntarily', a violent death at sea was staged, in which Truman
'loses' his father and henceforth must avoid open water.  In his days at
grade school, the young Truman stands up proudly in class and declares, 'I
want to be an explorer, just like Magellan...'  On cue, the teacher
instantly draws down the world map and sweetly tells Truman, 'You're too
late!'  Airplanes lose parts that fall from the sky and posters in the
travel agency warn of dire consequences to those who venture abroad (yet
this does not deter Truman from booking a flight to Fiji, one aspect of the
plot that seems out of place.)  The analogy is obvious--many of our fears
and limitations as human beings have bases in the society around us and
its agents.  

When the cracks begin to show in the carefully constructed world, and Truman
begins to realize the machinations of events surrounding him, at first he
thinks he is losing his mind.  Everyone treats him as if he were indeed
losing his mind, in order to contain his growing independence and
questioning.  At this point in the movie, one can see the strain under which
the actors labor;  their lives have reached a stasis point in which the only
achievement to strive towards is the repression of another's desire to break
out of a stultifying routine.  

The filmmakers brought out this theme in the latter half of the movie by
casting it as a classical epic, in which Truman battles against a
manipulative god who would rather kill his creation than lose his control
over it.  Truman survives a terrible storm and thinks that his escape is
complete---and then his boat literally runs into the end of the world.  Now,
please understand--I don't generally have big emotional reactions to movies,

most are too calculated for my taste.  But when Truman stands against that
wall and realizes the true enormity of what he faces, and he throws himself
against that well, trying to physically will himself through it to
freedom--well, I just lost it and had to go see the movie again in order to
see the full ending!  The last twenty minutes of the film provide a perfect
visualization of the human species trying to break free of the twin shackles
forged by religious belief and by mortality. At least Truman got to confront
his god, and to reject him with as much grace and dignity as a chattel slave
can muster upon shedding the chains.  I hope that someday we all get that
chance.

==========================================
The Truman Show
A response by Laurel Wentzel

The irony of Truman was that he was not a "trueman" until 
the end of the movie.  He was a fake.  He had every 
opportunity to leave his little island -- just like his "god", the 
director, said.  Truman could have ended up just like Citizen 
Kane thinking of the life he could've had if he had been real -- 
"Rosebud!"

Truman's experience of self-limitation was actually his own doing.  
Society was not "out to get Truman".  In fact, they loved him.  He 
was the height of a false reality.  Society vicariously sought to live 
through him -- kinda like Hollywood?  This isn't a crime.  In fact, it's 
human nature to want to be safe by limiting risks.  Perhaps unreality 
is part of the process -- why else the unreality? :o)

How to break out?  Risk.  Even with the fear involved in risk, as 

creatures and creators, we do have an exploratory nature.  Why are 
risks so dangerous to those who aren't even taking them?  Wasn't 
the teacher in the film so much like those smothering loving parents 
that fear what will happen to the love of their lives (their children) if 
there aren't some boundaries?  Plus, the unreality of it all will end and 
they'll have to fess up to life's uncertainty or admit that they really 
can't control everyone else on the planet.  There's a paradox involved.  
To love brings out feelings of protection.  But to truly love and let 
someone become a mature human being means letting go…….with 
the possibility of destruction (if you believe in that sort of thing).

How did Truman find himself?  Testing boundaries?  Questioning 
authority?  Institutions?  Questioning himself?  Looking at how he 
interpreted the past?  How about that picture he pasted together of 
his idea of something real -- the picture of love -- the first sense of 
meaning in his life?

The movie watchers in the theater of life that saw the movie Truman 
and those in the "movie", cheered on as he embodied the nobility of 
the human spirit to break through the bullshit -- no matter what the 
cost.  He was willing to risk it all to have a full life.  "Truemen" and 
"Truewomen" do exactly that when they realize who they really are 
and live according to the principles they believe in -- not ones arbitrarily 
assigned to them by others.  Truman was heroic.  Getting past fear 
and taking risks is always heroic.
Isn't it interesting to note that the film brings out paranoia in some of 
the watchers?  Was Truman paranoid when he became a "Trueman?"  
He simply took a bow for the part he had played and gracefully opened 
the exit door that is always there for us in life.

At the end did you notice how he was banging on the wall at first?  
How easy was it to just "open the door?"  Good grief!  The door even 
said, "Exit."  What more do you want?  That's the lesson.  It's the fear 
of fear that holds most of us back -- the stormy sea of that emotion that 
causes so much self-doubt that we think "everyone is in on it" when 
we're the biggest culprit.  We're the center of it.  It's our world.  Hmmm.

So, if the film is under your skin -- it may be highlighting the
"unrealities" 
you're living.  If there's anything to learn from Truman it's that being real 
begins at home in your own self.  Truman could have waited for his "god" 
to become "real" or his wife to become "real" etc.……  You get the drift? 
--- Pun ---- Ha!


He did it.  What a great hope and opportunity -- to set out to be the first 
if necessary -- but to do it.
I loved that movie and I feel great about myself and other people.
So what if we've got hang-ups -- we're working on them.  OK, it's taken 
thousands of years -- but so what!?  Just becoming upright was a hell of 
a task.
As each human being overcomes fear we will see real changes in all 
areas of human endeavor.  I'm taking my bow and I challenge you to 
start making that picture of what seems most real to you, sail the 
stormy sea -- the only thing that dies is your fear, don't bang your 
head on the wall, take the path of least resistance which is the open 
door -- your true nature and step into the unknown of really living freely 
and being yourself.

Even if you somehow alter human nature and DO eliminate government, there will
still be terrorists opposed to the institutions which greater society would
still require and demand.  And these terrorists will wage attacks on them.
And you will need an organized counterterrorist force.  And this force will
have to study terrorist groups to be effective.  So, again, it's simply
ridiculous to assume that only an oppressor need study terrorist groups.

Coupled to the most efficient way of spreading these Memes, would be identifying  the time when it is most effective to embark upon such a delivery.  At this point in time when we are on the edge of the new Millenium and noise levels relating to New Age Cults and forecasts of doom  and destruction etc are reaching their peak, or will do so within the next 18 months or so, Extropian memes etc may get " tarred with the wrong brush" whch is precisely what we are trying to avoid.    Once we are a year or two
into 21C, and it has become apparent that the end might not infact be as nigh as was " believed", the potential " meme market" might be more receptive to the Transhuman /Extropian philosophy.

Right, I was referring to velocity, not acceleration.  The point is,
the amount of power it takes for you to feel 1 g of acceleration is
independent of your velocity, simply because there is no such thing as
(absolute) velocity.  We can conclude immediately that a fast-moving
spaceship will not notice anything impeding its efforts to accelerate
at 1 g, because otherwise this would imply that the laws of physics
are somehow different for fast moving and slow moving objects, and the
principle of relativity forbids this.

(The principle of relativity is different from the theory of relativity:
the former merely says that you can't tell how fast you are going, while
the latter develops all the ramifications of this.)

This "rotation" is an optical illusion, not a real effect.  It is true
that you can see the back side of objects, but that is because of the way
the light rays travel to your eyes.  The objects are not really rotated,
if you take what you see and calculate the light travel time back to when
it was emitted.  Likewise the "starbow" and aberration effects which make
it look like the universe is compressed forward of you are illusions,
as is the appearance that the universe is evolving quickly ahead of you
and freezes into immobility as it passes.

This seems to me to be a very common
mistake. :)  The music *isn't* the "same";
it is only very similar.  That is, they are 
not really one piece of music, but two,
that happen to differ only in location. 
They do differ, though.

I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell
the difference, if you are not aware that there
are really two different CDs.  Of course, if the
CDs themselves are expected to be aware, 
then the first CD will never know it is "offline",
any more than other dead people know that
they are dead.

Very similar, at least.

	I think this makes sense.  Is this saying that even if the
point of equilibrium (where centrifugal force precisely equals
gravitational force) were in the center of your body, the inside of
your body (that which is facing towards the black whole) would be
enough closer to the black whole as to experience much more gravity,
and the outer part of your body (that which is away from the black
whole from this point) is far enough away from this point that it
would rip you apart?  Is that kind of what "Tidal forces" are or are
they different entirely?

	Not quite a literal bounded "circle".  It's simply warped.
That which is directly behind you would remain behind you no matter
how fast you go wouldn't it?  That which would appear 10 degrees away
from behind your direction of motion at rest would continually warp
more and more toward directly in front of you as you approached the
speed of light right?  I guess at the speed of light, everything but
that which was directly behind you would be directly (as in a point,
not a "circle") in front of you?  But isn't this simply due to
"aberration" of light (as in it looks like rain is falling horizontal
if you are moving fast enough?) rather than actual
transformation/warping of space?

"How are you, Mr. Nilsson?"

I looked around in the room. It was fairly small, dominated by my bed
and a large panorama window overlooking forested hillsides bathing in
sunlight. The air was crisp and somewhere pleasant classical music
played. Everything had a distinct hospital feel, the feel of an
expensive private hospital. I wondered why I was there, but a vague
memory of explosions, disaster and pain made me stop thinking about it
for now. But I felt quite fine, in fact better than I could recall
feeling in a long time. I looked at the nurse in the doorway.

"Oh, I feel fine." 

"Great. We were worried that our reconstruction of your neural
structure was not complete. If you notice anything odd, be it memory
problems, strange sensations or odd thoughts, please tell us and we'll
help."

Reconstruction? Some facts began to fall into the place.

"Please, tell me the truth: did you upload me?"

The nurse looks concerned.  "Yes, it was the only way. The accident
killed too much of your brain for conventional medicine to save, but
we were on site very soon and could begin scanning immediately. This
is virtual reality."

This place isn't real. The bed is just information in some computer
doing physics calculations and then converting them into simulated
experience. The sunlight, hillside, even the nurse are all virtual
constructs (the nurse probably just a puppet controlled by a real
nurse elsewhere). And I'm not me. I am just an impostor thinking I'm
myself, a soulless construct with no consciousness.

Wait a bit. Who am I? *I'm* certainly conscious, I experience this
existence (whatever it may be). But I had always believed computer
programs, ais and uploads to be just simulations, mere appearances of
thinking despite what all others said. Could it be that the nurse lied
for some strange reason, and I was not an upload? No, deep down I felt
the truth of it; that accident had been far too real to survive. So if
I was an upload, then it at least proved software could be conscious -
something I would never have believed just a few days (?) ago.

But I was not my old self, could not be. I... no, *he*, was dead. I
was just a copy of him, a perfect copy that thought he was the
original. Not even that, an impostor who knew he was an impostor. How
could anybody believe that uploading gave immortality! But at the same
time... I remembered my (no, his) childhood, the old house my (his!)
grandparents had on the rocky island, the graduation ceremony, the job
interview - everything. I felt like he did; despite the worries of the
nurse everything seemed to be alright in my mind: the same habits of
thought (like my tendency to introspect instead of facing the fear),
my feelings, my faith.

My faith. I asked the nurse to leave me, and began to pray. I had
heard all sorts of intellectual arguments of why uploading preserved
identity, I knew them all. Even if many of them were ingenious and
logical they were in the end just arguments, they could never prove
anything. Only experience could truly prove something, like the fact
that I was actually conscious. But did I have a soul? Could I still
pray to God for guidance? Regardless of who I was, that was the most
important thing for me. So I prayed more fervently than I had ever
done (had I already begun to truly believe I was the continuation of
my physical life? So much for convictions in the face of
experience). I prayed to God to help me out of this awful metaphysical
confusion, to find something to be truly certain of.

He answered. I suddenly felt Him in the core of my being, around me,
everywhere; something infinite and omninipotent but at the same time
familiar. "OF COURSE YOU HAVE A SOUL. YOU ARE HEARING ME NOW, AREN'T
YOU?". It was not so much a voice such as a realization; I felt
uplifted, fearful, awed and overjoyed. No matter if I really *was*
that person who had been mortally hurt in the accident, I retained his
memories, habits and personality, I was his continuation, I had a
soul, I was a person, I was with God. Everything was fine.

But I had a small question remaining (two questions, actually). "Is it
the same soul as I had before the accident? And why didn't you answer
my prayers like this before?". "YOU DID NOT HAVE A SOUL BEFORE THE
ACCIDENT. NOW YOU HAVE."

I am wondering if any members of the list are on the Life Extension
Foundations Protocol, and if so, what you think of it.

 I recently received their 1998 directory of life extension
nutrients and drugs, and am impressed enough to consider switching
to their products/protocol.

In many ways it is very similiar to the protocol I have been using,
which was developed independantly.

It seems to me that the "rational moral philosophers" have discovered
something that has been fooling humans for a long time: problem shift.
When they claim to be able to discern an objective "this is what you ought
to do" they divert attention from their subjective premises, which are
assumed a-priori.  "You ought to do this" IF you want to achieve the
subjective goal of the week, be it "happiness", "well-being", "financial
gain", or what have you.

They haven't conquered irrationality, just used a slight-of-hand to focus
attention of the objective bits....

Frankly, I don't understand all this fascination with "being
revolutionary". I think that transhuman core values are perfectly
old-fashioned. "Surviving/Life is a good thing, cooperation (nondefection)
too, and change is not an ends in itself but a means of
survival in an coevolutionary context." What's so revolutionary about that?
 
Of course there are a few transhumanists who wants to abandon humanity for
pretty random reasons, at a whim of fancy ("I wanted to become blue sky"), or 
morphing yourself into a living work of art, etc. No problem with that, too.

In any case, if the possibility itself is at all real the motivations
do not matter, the final product does. And let's make it a good one, eh?

Perhaps we should theoretize less -- imo both extropians/>H for quite some
time now show distinct trend to memetic inbreeding, which might
indicate that the discussion part is now largely over, and most of 
value is having been said already. The lists are still very valuable for new
readers/socializing, but there seems a distinct need to split up in
the memefecting team and the implementation team, the latter for those 
technically inclined. So you techies/scientists out there, go out and 
try giving your careers a transhumanist twist. As we are few, it's
sure going to be a small contribution, but every single one will count 
in the end.

If you search through the archives for threads
with cryptic names like "Uploading" and
"Consciousness" you'll find that this conversation
has been had many times before.

I think it might be easier to think of both of

function/product of the brain."

The distinction between "original" and "copy" is

I think Daniel Fabulich did a good job of
disputing this with his CD Player analogy. This is
why I said, "consciousness is a function/product
of the brain." It's best to think of it as music,
rather than an instrument.

If cell replacement was performed gradually it's
possible the patient would feel nothing. Not
because the consciousness has died or is being
destroyed, but because it is maintained. As I
said, the distinction between "original" and
"copy" is not a useful one.

You say, "the consciousness arises because of the
actions of the brain cells." With that in mind, a
computer that simulates only these "actions" (and
not even the cells themselves) would produce
consciousness.

A common statement made on this list is that we
cannot know if other people are conscious. This is
then used to assume that if it walks, talks, and
sounds like you - it is you. Our only option is to
assume that consciousness *is* simply produced by
our brains. There is absolutely no data to prove
otherwise, and it's disputable that there ever
will be.

I'm not sure but I get the feeling that you
believe there will be some sort of paranormal
"connection" between the two cloned minds. There
is no reason to think this.

Inbreeding causes problems because of hereditary
disease, so if we were uploading with advanced
nanotechnology it wouldn't be too much of a
stretch to correct any problems. You could always
give the two people completely separate genomes
but correctly engineered brains.

To experience it from both sides, both minds would
need to share the thoughts. If that were possible
(perhaps through memory transplants) then it would
make for a truly interesting experience. But I
don't think this would require a mind cloned
transgender version of your self.

You can augment yourself without uploading, so I
don't see a problem here. Saying that the mind is
a very volatile thing and in order to upload we
must make sure everything is perfect is an easy
argument to make. But look how we treat our minds
just going about everyday business - sleeping,
getting drunk, learning - these all cause dramatic
changes. You can even loose large chunks of your
memory without creating a national emergency.

Multiple personalities (or more rightly
Disassociative Identity Disorder) is a mental
illness. It would no doubt be a mean feat to
upload one of those "personalities" (the reason we
now call it an "identity disorder" is simply
because there are not actually multiple
personalities). Likewise it would be *impossible*
to get two people into one brain without extra
hardware (as you said yourself, they are defined
by the hardware).

I don't know the figures behind this, but from
personal experience all my life-shattering

Brothers often move apart, family shattering maybe
but hardly great science. I still get the awful
feeling you believe there might be some psychic
connection between the cloned minds.

More precisely you originally said consciousness
is cause by the "actions" of the cells, not
necessarily the cells structure. We've already had
success in recreating certain brain functions with
artificial replacements for synapses, etc. Since
there is no reason to suspect consciousness comes
from anywhere but the brain, it stands to reason
that a simulated brain would have all the
functions of consciousness. The fact that we
cannot yet prove this is more food for
philosophers than lost sleep for scientists.

This kind of discussion reminds me of one of my favorite SF series; Michael
Moorcock's "Dancers at the end of time". The stories have a lot in common
with Banks' "Culture" in that they're basically about a bunch of transhumans
who have lots of power and lots of free time, but seen from a sixties or
seventies perspective. Although the stories aren't terribly well-written, 
I think that much of their behaviour -- for example indifference to 
'lesser' beings (e.g. human time-travellers are put in zoos and traded 
like pets) -- seems quite true to life; they don't care much about humans,
because in general they're not really regarded as 'people'.

>Probably not.

It is not extended lifespans that cause overpopulation but 
ONLY THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH THROUGH REPRODUCTION.

Here are some arguments against overpop caused by immortality :

1) When there is exponential growth this will result in 
overpopulation anyway, WITH or WITHOUT immortality of 
the preceding generation, because in both cases the growth 
will remain exponential. So in both cases a population limit 
on Earth will be reached, however in the first case only some 
30 years earlier. 

2) There is still sufficient living room on the Earth. The present 
limiting factor is not lack of room but the production of food
and raw materials. New technologies will result in ever more raw 
materials (and also food) per head in the future. In the future, 
in principle there could be room on Earth for more than a 100 
billion people. 
Overpopulation is only a function of technology. 

3) Emigration to outer space will be utilized in the future. 
In space the human population could continue exponential growth
for a long time.

4) In general it holds that when populations are getting more 
prosperous its reproduction rate decreases.

Last week's Economist has a piece on Canadian pot.  Allegedly Vancouver has
a San Francisco-like attitude, so many Vietnam draft resisters ended up there,
bringing their pot seeds with them.  The pot has since been bred for the
climate and 30% THC content (vs. 2% originally.)  It's estimated that the
B.C. pot market is $4 billion -- more than mining or farming, and close to
tourism.  British Columbia apparently has a fairly laidback attitude towards
having or even growing pot -- illegal, but ill-enforced.  

"I know!  Let's decertify Canada!"

The article also mentioned that the US has 500,000 people in prison on
marijuana charges.  Canadians may not be able to have handguns, but, hmm.

I heard about a geology department considering hiring a new (untenured) 
professor.  He was a creationist, but the committee decided that his religous
beliefs didn't effect his work, which was excellent.  So they hired him.

Part of the reason odd religous beliefs can persist so long is the ability
of people to partition those beliefs, so they don't actually much influence
practical choices.

This seems too much to hope for.  But it may be possible to create
sub-associations to be that proud of.  I'd really love for there to be 
an academic quality journal of transhuman issues.  The Journal of
Transhumanism (http://www.transhumanist.com/) is an attempt, but
we have yet to see how far it will succeed.  (I have the latest article
there, which is crying for some open peer review.)

Those interested in life-extension should be interested to learn
that health specialists are still quite ignorant about some really
big factors that cause some people to die, and others to live.  

Sociologists and other social scientists have long studied some 
very strong correlations between social status and health, but 
medical science has been slow to accept that wealth causes health.

The June 3, 1998 Journal of the American Medical Association leads
with a study that medical researchers consider careful enough to 
command their attention.  An abstract is at:
http://www.ama-assn.org/sci-pubs/journals/archive/jama/vol_279/no_21/oc72105a.htm

Here are the death rate ratio parameters from their model:

Age       25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74   75+
            1.0  2.66  3.46  9.30 16.78 40.00
Sex       Male  Female
           1.0     .41
Race      NonBlack Black
               1.0  1.19
Residence Rural Suburban City
           1.0      1.16 1.52
Education 16+yrs 12-15 0 -11
           1.0      .95   .90
Income    30K$+ 10-29K$ <10K$
            1.0   2.14   2.77
Smoking   Never  current former
            1.0     1.26   1.28
Alcohol drinks/mo.  Moderate None Heavy
                         1.0 1.13   .85
Body Mass Normal Underweight Overweight
             1.0        2.03        .94
Physical Activity  Quintiles 
    5(high)   4    3    2  1(low)
       1.0 1.46 1.60 2.25  2.91

The article and media about it have focused on the income 
parameters, which are indeed striking.  But other parameters 
are also striking.  

While smoking gets tons of media attention, it only raises 
mortality rates by ~27%.  And being black is only a 19% hit.  
In contrast, living in a city raises mortality by 50%, 
relative to being rural, and being a man raises mortality by 
a factor of 2.5.   Drinking alcohol and being overweight don't
much matter, but physical activity matters for a factor of 3, 
as much as income does.

I'm quite sure costs can be kept relatively low if you use local
networks (so that the transhumanists in a country or region have
a way to get in touch when phones/the net etc. are down. These 
[local networks] are the most useful anyway. Maybe it would also
be possible to have one stronger sender per local group, but
obviously some research into radio gear would be necessary for
this.

Actually, the survivalist "thing" is just a part of a greater
vision to turn transhumanist philosophy into something practical.
Maybe (hopefully) no disaster will happen, and the singularity,
when it comes, will be a pleasant one. But...we can't rely on that.
Many transhumanists belief that there is a considerable chance that
things will go very wrong within the coming decades, and certainly
not all of those are wide-eyed, gun-toting survivalist freaks.

So, what's the logical thing to do for someone who wishes to be
around for an indefinite period of time? Right, you prepare
yourself (as far as finaces etc. allow) for the worst, and hope
for the best.

It's probably a bit beyond our finacial capabilities, but ideally
we'd have this abovementioned network and a couple of old
nuclear bunkers troughout the world with, aside from all the
basic supplies and a fully autonomous cryonics installation etc, 
computers & books with as much of today's relevant knowledge as 
possible, a bit like the Ark. Of course such databases already
exist, but most if not all are in places that would be prime
targets in a conflict, or they would be occupied by very 
unpleasant military folk. 

It goes without saying, btw, that a privately owned island would
be even better than the bunkers, being a highly unlikely target
for any sort of WW-style attack, and it's better living too, you're
already in your safe place when the shit hits the fan (always 
unexpectedly) etc. Also, unlike the bunkers, the island could
actually be a great source of income too. But, ah well.

Not really, since anyone can join at the touch of a button and
the files are public (worse yet, they're all over the net due
to HotBot etc.)

Ditto...

No. The main list could remain as it is, but a 
"transcore" (transhumanist hardcore ;-) list would
be added to the existing repertoire. Basically,
anyone who wants to be on it could join, unless
others identify you as a known "rat".

Maybe not, but as others already remarked some (new) list members
could be intimidated/annoyed by certain discussions on this list,
like the "survivalist" meme. Also, we may not want to paste *all*
comments all over the net, which is effectively the case with this
list (try just about any topic, and search engines like HotBot 
come up with dozens of postings from this list. Great advertizing
trick for sure -- unless it happens to be one of the many not-so-
politically-correct postings).

For those of us who have pursued certain paths of thinking throughout 
life, yes, but then major paradigm shifts always seem a reasonable 
progression to their adherents.  And we are talking about something 
even more than a paradigm shift, we are talking about a metafilter 
through which all human information can be processed in some way or 
other.  Whole chunks of human delusion must be rejected once processed 
through that filter, and to most of the human population, this 
represents a huge and scary leap.

True, such tidal effects would exist unless you were on the surface of a flat 
infinite plane and admittedly such objects seem to be rather few and far

 Xactly. You _will_ wind up in jail for a day if failing to produce
 appropriate credentials in Moscow, Russia. (I don't carry my passport,

You can be arrested or as the police phrase it "detained" in this country for
not carrying an ID..If a law enforcement official stops you for whatever
reason and asks for your ID and you have none he/she has the power to detain
you, bring you into the station house, fingerprint you.  These laws are known
as vagrancy laws and include such items as being charged with vagrancy if one
does not have at least $10.00 in cash, or some other ready source of money.
(ATM card, credit card, travellers check..)  Not all of the variations are on
the books in all states, but if you think you can take a midnight stroll down
the boardwalk with out carrying ID, you might be in for a rude surprise.

Recently, a judge ruled that it was unconstitutional to punish someone for
marijuana posession, citing the hypocrisy inherent in allowing alcohol and
nicotine, and banning THC.  I'm not sure if this will set up a legal
precedent or not.

The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police made a public statement that
it was okay to grow marijuanna for personal consumption.

Since we have no FBI, one town in British Columbia decided to legalize
marijuana.  There is nothing stopping them from doing this.

I thought USA was supposed to be the decentralized one?!?

That's because America has federally-imposed mandatory minimum sentences,
so judges cannot lighten a possession sentence, or make an offender
elligible for parol.  You'd think judges would have some sort of body to
lobby stuff like this.  I know I'd be miffed if I was a judge and the feds
were telling me I had to incarcerate a pot smoker for longer than a
rapist/murderer (no exaggeration!)

This is completely wrong, that is say that the E mail message you sent me  
contained erroneous ideas, I have no way of knowing if the original message  
you typed on your computer was right or wrong because I never saw it, all I 
saw was a copy and that's just not the same thing.
           

        >I will agree with this.  There is no way to tell the difference, 
           

If there is no way to tell the difference then what makes you think there is 
a difference?

For some reason in these thought experiments people always identify with the 
"original", just for fun imagine what it's like to be the "copy". You may  
have been created only 5 minutes age but it doesn't matter because you have 
the memories of Randall R Randall, you remember being the Randall R  Randall 
of yesterday so the Randall R Randall of yesterday is not dead. Death means 
having a last thought and Randall R Randall hasn't had one of those yet.

I probably haven't convinced you but I'll bet I could have if only you'd seen 
my original message, it was great and would have really knocked your socks off 
but unfortunately you'll just have to settle for a copy.

This strategy can be useful, but note that it can be used to defend
just about anything: "Nobody thought heavier-than-air flying was
possible, so why can't antigravity be possible?". It is even better if
you can point at some sources that support you, that grounds the
argument even more strongly in reality. 

Today wearable computers are as silly to most as star trek
communicators; there is a good chance next generation is going to grow
up with them.

No, of course not. But there have never been any competition between
practical work or PR. In fact, practical work is great PR if handled
well ("Don't whine about Y2K, this is how you can protect yourself if
things go badly!"; "We have implemented a backlink system for critical
analysis to make our own discussions more rational"; "I use these
simple methods to live longer and feel healthier" etc.). In fact, one
of the most common criticisms against transhumanism is that it is just
talk, so practical work is good from a PR point of view. Just don't
call it "survivalism" or something that will bring bad associations.

An interesting idea. Of course, implementing something like this with
a reasonable chance to survive global disruptions is extremely hard
and would require a lot of dedicated work for everyone involved. But
it might be interesting to figure out how to create a worldwide
transhuman cooperative network to help members from local trouble
(like saving you if the banks burst or us swedes once our government
goes completely crazy :-), that is likely easier and much more needed.

This is where I think the transhuman business network idea we
discussed on TV98 briefly would come in handy as a start, as well as
helping each other learn the necessary skills to become wealthy. At
our summercamp, for example, Valdemar Ingdahl will lecture about
reaching economic independence, which seems to be a good start.

I think you have the mistaken impression that I think all practical
work to further transhumanist goals will be bad for PR. Not at all -
it will likely be a great PR boon if handled well. But what I worry
about is formulating it in the wrong way, making it look like
something nasty, secretive or dangerous. That was why I attacked the
word "survivalism" - it is tainted and will be misunderstood. The same
goes for many other practical activities, some need to be handled very
carefully (for example, research into cognition enhancing drugs is
best done in a very dry and scientific way, otherwise people will link
it to narcotics. Once they are accepted scientifically, things can
change).

Seems rather different from Bank's Culture, where the Culture treats
the lesser civilizations with respect - they might be laughing behind
their backs at their silly ideas, but they don't interfere directly.
I would say his point is that with power you can also afford to be
nice. 

This seems to be borne out with how our societies are moving right
now: we are wealthy enough to care that our meat comes from animals
living under "good" circumstances and that we do not destroy our
environment even when it has little economical influence on us. If you
are poor, then Brecht's observation holds much more strongly: "Erst
das Fressen, dann die Moral" (first the grub, then the moral).

I've been on their protocol for over 10 years, after having bought
supplements from various sources for almost 20 years prior. From the
standpoint of product selection, quality and price, I can't say enough good
things about them.

Another benefit is the Foundation plows a good portion of their revenues
into life extension research.

Management also riskedpersonal jail sentences and spent a fortune in
fighting the FDA over supplement availability, promotion, consumer rights
etc., while other vitamin companies sat on the sidelines and profited from
the Foundation's efforts and success.

Lots of good reasons to use their products.

I would love to contribute some writing.  I wrote a paper over a year
ago, which now resides at www.mit.edu/people/lion/Yin-Yang.html
Any comments would be appreciated.

Perhaps artwork as well?  My graphic submission for the 1999 Cognitive

Depending on the projected timeline of the project, I might be able to
compose new original material for the anthology as well.

Thank you,

Since you assume that the copy of the

you may assume that it is exactly 
similar to my copy of the original email. :)

If the upload (or copying) is done in a way that
*could* have left the original undestroyed, then
the upload is a copy.  That is to say, I would 
agree that an upload done cell by cell, over a
conscious period of time, is the same individual
after the upload.  But if it is conducted in such a
way that there could be *two* people who are
exactly similar, *at least* one of them is not the
original.  Given this, a scan made of my brain
and then uploaded is a *version* of me, but is
not me in the same way that the person who
will be having my dinner later is me.

Agreed so far.

This is what I disagree with.  *This* R^3 *may have*
had a last thought.  This reminds me of my geometry
classes in the eighties.  If you have a triangle on the
paper in front of you, you can create a triangle with
all of the same measurements, as exactly as you'd 
like.  This triangle is *similar* to the original, but since
we can see the original beside it, it is clear that they
are not the same triangle.  They differ only in location,
but they do differ.

BTW, what if it becomes possible to copy all
of a person's memories and insert them in 
other people?  Does this mean that the person
who created the memories is effectively 
immortal?  Can he shoot himself without dying?

Aw, shucks.  :)
BTW, this is an excellent reason (IMO, of course)
to disapprove of "intellectual property", which I do,
for the same reasons that I want *this* copy of me
to survive.

This is a very good point, and one I also use in discussing transhumanism with
people.  I often ask people to think about the major changes in world view and
lifestyle that happened in the last half of the 18th century and point out
parallels between our own time and the Enlightenment.  It often gets people to
focus on the fact that that some periods in history DO involve fundamental
change and that this just might be one of them.

I don't think this is true in general. It appears to me that more people
become upset about Rwanda's apes and danger to them than about the human
lives lost to intertribal warfare. I suspect that most non-black americans
would be more upset about a fifty percent decrease in the African ape population
than a fifty percent decrease in the african human population. Please note
that I am not advocating this view, I'm just reporting on my intuition
about most americans. Black americans are not less sensitive to the
ape's problems, but are likely more sympathetic to the problems of
african humans. If I pick a different continent and a different
species with good PR, (asia, pandas) I'll get the same general result
with a different set of americans.

Before you disagree, ask yourself how you feel. I'm not picking on Scott
or Dwayne: everyone can play. To the extent that you worry about loss
of habitat for apes, you are severely restricting the options for some
fairly poor and desperate african tribespeople, some of whom could sell
ape's feet, rhino horns, or elephant tusks to buy food and medicine to
keep their kids alive.

I personally take a view that is fairly callous and cruel: human
overpopulation will inevitably destroy all ecosystems if allowed to
do so. Therefore, restricting human over-exploitation of ecosystems
at worst merely slightly advances a restriction that would eventually
occur anyway. To the extent that this generates economic hardship that
results in excess human death, I'm an evil person.

I think the way out of this mess is through technology. Transhuman-level
technology is allows a very large human population to live a luxurious
lifestyle with a relatively minor and controllable environmental impact.
(i.e., hundreds of times more people with less than the current impact.)

This is very important for the transhuman argument. The status quo is
not the alternative to transhumanism, since the status quo is unstable.
If we let the opposition assume a stable status quo, we lose one of our
strongest arguments.

Malthus ultimately recanted his whole theory; not just the date, but the
whole damnable thing, when he discovered that, actually, food production
was increasing geometrically too.  False alarm, as usual.

The best and clearest argument is this:  economically speaking, people
produce more than they consume on average; this is a well researched and
much puzzled at fact.  Of course, part of the reason this is true is
because "economic production" includes a lot of things we wouldn't
consider production from an ecological point of view: chopping down tress
and turning them into paper, pumping oil out of the ground and turning it
into disposable cutlery and building houses on uninhabited soil are all
activities which economists would consider "production," but which
obviously reduce the resources available to us.

However, it would be folly to understate the value of the economic
prosperity which results.  Because each person produces more than they
consume, each extra person adds more extra wealth for each person to use;
everyone becomes richer by this process (yes, as noted, some faster than
others, but the effect is absolutely positive for everyone).  More extra
wealth means better housing, better eating, better education.  And the
more educated people we have out there, the more minds we have at work
trying to figure out how to create even more wealth that we can sell to
the rest of us. 

So we can see already that so long as we don't run out of resources, more
people leads to more prosperity.  The question is, when do we run out of
resources?  Well, not when we run out of reosurces on earth; long before
that it will become economically profitable to mine resources from nearby
asteroids and planets.  Not even when we run out of resources in our solar
system; there are obviously orders of magnitude more energy and space
available in other solar systems in our galaxy ... and so on.  Have no
fear that we will go about exhausting each source before moving on to the
next: the price system makes certain that as we begin to approach the
point where we are about to run out of an important resource, the price
will rise, making it more profitable to leave the resource be and seek out
a cheaper one, as we have been doing for centuries.

So the point is this: increasing population leads to increasing prosperity
for all until we run out of useful resources in this universe; my money is
on this not happening for several billions of years, if ever.

I feel like you're making the implicit presumption that if there are two
of something, then they must be different; that two things cannot be the
same.  This seems weird to me.

Well, take egoism for example.  It's the easiest to adapt to this model:
egoism can be defined like this:  "You ought to do whatever is most in
your subjective interests."  Clearly this circumvents the problem you
assert above: I completely agree that a person's goals are entirely
subjective, but I can come up with a theory of practical rationality which
is compatible with it.

As I noted in earlier posts, however, egoism is wrong, and we'd certainly
be better off with utilitarianism.  Either way, however, these are
theories about how you should go about getting what you want, not about
deciding what you want.

On the flip side of the same argument, I'd say you're asking the theory to
do more than it claims to do.  I'm not really sure what you mean by
"conquering irrationality," but having a rational theory about how to act
given a set of irrational or non-rational preferences is a non-trivial
step forward, I'd say.

No, no no!  That triangle is more than just similar; it is CONGRUENT.  An
important distinction, since similar triangles may differ greatly in size.
Also important because I think it would not be at all unreasonable to say
that two congruent triangles are two identical instances of the same
triangle; think object-oriented if you will.

Again, without some theory like this, you can never have two of ANYTHING
which are the same; the word "same" is utterly meaningless in this
context.  On some level, this argument is saying that no two of anything
are the same, so clearly no two CDs are the same, no two instances of a
consciousness are the same, no two triangles are the same...

Dodge City was a lawless frontier. Modern American cities are places 
where because of the population density, there are high 
concentrations of criminals. These criminals, because of their 
nature, tend to ignore 'gun control' laws such as the Brady Bill, and 
purchase their arms from the black market, or steal them.

In cities where concealed carry laws are in effect (Florida and 
Texas) there is a lower incidence of violent crime than in cities 
that prohibit law abiding people from even owning a gun (Chicago and 
Washington DC).

The armed citizen is nothing to fear; he is civilized and will not 
start shooting unless there is no other way to defend himself. The 
disarmed citizen is at the mercy of the criminals, and possibly, of 
the police state that will inevitably evolve to cope with them.

Concealed carry laws restrict the right to carry to those who meet 
several tests of behavior and training. There are plenty of laws on 
the books to deal with the very few who obtain a permit and abuse 
their right.

If all stable, intelligent people carried a gun at all times, the 
incidence of violent crime would plummet, because all but the most 
stupid of criminals would realize they are playing Russian roulette 
by attempting to commit crimes.

If you define a 'criminal' as one who would harm you or yours, it's 
pretty obvious if you are under attack by a criminal. Law abiding 
persons do not commit crimes, nor do they attack other citizens.

Therefore, if you see someone committing or attempting to commit a 
crime upon yourself or your family or property, you will be pretty 
unlikely to be shooting at an innocent. Police, on the other hand, 
sometimes try to apprehend a suspect based on appearance or proximity 
to an alleged crime scene, and sometimes will end up shooting an 
innocent bystander because of their race, clothing, or 'suspicious' 
behavior.

I am reminded of an incident a few years back where police shot and 
killed a child with a toy gun - one of those plastic things with the 
signal orange muzzle, nonetheless. They saw the kid hiding in the 
bushes with a 'weapon' and assumed the worst..I believe this happened 
in Wisconsin, possibly near Milwaukee..

Apparently you misunderstood a few things that I said.
Frankly, I don't blame you, a lot of this was written
relatively late at night.

If you didn't notice in here, I really didn't make any
conclusions on anything (in fact, I sort of 'proved'
myself wrong.)  This was just sort of a linear analysis
of whatever I could think of on the subject, which actually
changes throughout the document.

I should have stated that better.  I was mainly just
asking that if anyone had a very memorable topic
(something like: "The Life of B. Norman") that
specifically detailed a lot of this.

It is to me, since if there is a distinction then
my 'original consciousness' is dead.  Now, I like the
concept of my body living on after me, it could do
a lot of good in the universe, but if, as I said, it
is a different consciousness than mine, then it sort
of defeats a large part of uploading in the first
place, to 'live' forever as me, not just as my body
with a different consciousness.

'I' could die, but my body would live on.

I'm not saying that it's 'certain,' or even 'probable,'
but consciousness seems to be a fickle thing, and if
my consciousness *were* dependent on the charges and
such in my body as it is now, then it is certainly
'possible' that any other consciousness that could
arise from my body would not be the 'original.'

'I' could just die as normal when uploaded.  Another
consciousness would inhabit my body, and since it
had my memories, would not know that 'I' (this
consciousness) had ever existed.

Granted, logically it does seem that any later
consciousness should be the same, in all ways, including
'being aware that it was the first consciousness',
I suppose is the best way to say it.  No matter what,
the 'new' consciousness would certainly 'think' that
it was a continuation of the first (there would be no
reason for it to think differently), but if the first was
lost, then it would be a very useful distinction,
indeed.

I will admit right now that this is more paranoia than
anything logical.  I would hate to actually have a
ways and means to live forever, and have it crushed
by something totally uncontrollable like this.  Thus
would 'I' die unfulfilled.  (Any other consciousness
from my body could still become fulfilled, though,
which would give it a little worth.)

I, obviously, disagree.  (Attacking a metaphor is
rather pointless in any light, but here it goes
anyway.)  The sound that the speakers make
is (for simplicity's sake) the same, and the pattern
of electricity inside brought about by the specific CD
is the same, but the thing causing these actions
(the CD) is different.

To take out of metaphor...

The actions of the body may be the same, the firings
in the brain may happen the same, but the thing 'thinking'
to make this occur is not necessarily the same.

I hope that you at least understand what I mean.  Read
these words over again and try to find exactly why I
worded certain things such.

I *don't* believe that I will die if I get uploaded (hence
all the 'if's and 'possibly's), but I still consider the
possibility, since I'd much rather have possible solutions
for the minute chance that it be true.

Alright, this part is mutually understood. (Though
I could still consider this 'original' to the effect
that, if consciousness is, say, the electric current
(unlikely, but possible) that it has just been
'transferred,' not 'replaced' (which would imply that
the original is gone).

Remember this topic, it becomes important later.

The original assumption was that it *was* literally a
part of the cells themselves.  As I went on with
the discussion, I moved away from this highly confining
assumption through a logically possible course.
Remember, I come back to this point with more
'evidence' and deem it then, logically possible, with
the newer concepts that had 'come to light' through
reasoning in the document.

I won't disagree here, but I have to say that the
universe doesn't have to operate only on what
humans, with whatever happens to be their current
knowledge level, assume.  Relativity doesn't work
for everything.

Again, this isn't a large complaint, just a follow-up
to my points about whether what I call the 'original
consciousness' should be examined.

Sometimes one might benefit from assuming without
reason, and later find reason to fill in the gap
(not built of any points found as a result of things
*after* the gap, though, of course).  So if it isn't
threatening something greater, (which this case
wouldn't) we shouldn't just limit ourselves to
examining that which we can assume.

Here is also where I might not have been totally
clear in the original post.  It isn't "paranormal."
It is logical.

It is logical to assume that consciousness would pass
into replacing nanotech machines that resembled the
original cells closely enough.  Consciousness travels
into other such additions to the brain.

Now, as I said in the original post, if instead of
just one grouping of nanotech machines replacing the entire
brain, two grouping were introduced, each replacing
only half (and at the end connecting to each other.)
So we still have a whole, functioning brain, just
made up of two groupings of nanotech devices.  Next, The
two halves are separated spatially, but still connected
through wires (which transmit the normal brain signals
from one half to the other, and vice versa, as would
normally happen.)  One consciousness is still controlling
both halves, correct?

          Bad diagram of the two halves
 E-----------------------------------------------3
      (wire still allows normal sending of
       messages, just over larger distance)

Then, each brain side has the required machines *copied* (in
any way required) from the other side, and added to
it's side, so the left(or top) now becomes the left and
an exact copy of the right (or the top and copy of bottom)
while the right now becomes a right and an exact copy of
the left (or, again, the bottom and copy of top).  Would the
consciousness not expand to become a part of these portions
too?  (Say for technical sake, that as layer after layer
of cell was added, the wire was physically altered (parts
removed and reconnected, or such) so that it would allow
the same 'normal' connection.  (i.e., 3/4s are connected
to opposing 1/4 (assuming that it could be placed correctly
inside these portions without disturbance.)  Also, instead
of the wire, the signals could be transmitted via waves of
some kind (not sure of the plausibility of this), or even
just calculated accurately in a computer using personality
traits and the like.

Either way, we now have
 ______________      ______________
/   original   \    /   copy of    \
|     top      |    |     top      |
----------------    ----------------
  \ copy of /         \ original /
   | bottom|           | bottom|
    -------             -------

That are not connected, but, if you followed my description
of the process (consciousness filling in for both still-
connected sides, as they both were appended up until they
were individual brains) you should see how I see a possibility
that the same consciousness could control both.

Any questions, still?  I'd seriously like to hear your
thoughts on this.

See above.

Wait, if you will, please explain how memory transplants
could do it (theoretically, at least.)  How would you
explain the idea that this would cause the sharing
of thoughts.  Speaking of which, I'm still not clear
as to what you believe causes consciousness to form.

Taking your previous statement that we are forced 
(at least logically) to assume that consciousness
if formed by the brain, then technically, anything with
my brain makeup could become conscious?  I assume that
that would also mean that a variety of other non living
things (depending on what *exactly* makes consciousness)
things are conscious, but just cannot act on desires
physically.

These were actually just a segue into the uses,
mainly bad, of the single consciousness/multiple
brain thing which apparently I didn't explain well
enough.

Again, sorry, you misunderstood.  I'd love to hear
your comments on the type of multiple *personalities*
(i.e. multiple non-exact brains (due to differing
memories) controlled by one consciousness) as I
mentioned, used in this purpose, though.

I didn't say it as putting forth my belief, I used
it only as a starting point for this analysis.  It
seems (to me) that the only real opposition to multiple
consciousness in one brain is the physical question of
electrical charge in the neurons and such.  Just that
people don't yet have true "multiple personalities"
isn't proof that it will never happen.

I suppose that this changes from person to person.
My intended point was just that it would be a more
drastic change to the personality for someone with
a 'networked' consciousness to have a body with no
memories and receive every memory originally, than
for someone with a lot of them, who is just being
slowly splitting from the point in time where the
memories would be identical (i.e. the point just
before multiplicity occurred.)

Heh, yes, once again, I should not be writing such
'presentation-important' things on a tired mind.  I
doubt many here were around (and aware of the mechanics
of physics) when relativity was first introduced to the
world. :)

Call it 'psychic,' but I just did not covey properly

This was me just making points in logical steps.
Whether I worded it properly or not, I started with
the assumption that the cells themselves created
and maintained consciousness (and, now, (upon rereading)
I do not expect you to have known that I meant that).

To the extent that LES supports individualization of that protocol (and this
is what I hear from their local chapter)--I support it.  If someone from the
LES is saying that this protocol, and no other, is going to make you live
longer, that should raise some flags.

Two very important points to keep in mind in any supplementation program:

1.  A thorough knowledge of the effects and contradictions of EVERY
component of EVERY supplement.  People have unknowingly sabotoged their own
efforts due to drug interactions, insufficient or too high dosage, and
inattention to body responses.  Specific medical problems may require
changes in supplementation, or the addition of supplements not in the
protocol, to achieve full effect.

2.  Changing supplement brands after taking one consistently for a year.
The base ingredients can cause intolerance just as can result from eating
the exact same foods 
very day.  This can be frustrating after finding that 'perfect' combination
pill, I know!  But malabsorption means throwing money down the drain.

Yes, and that is what I would disagree with.
I know that it is not usually useful to consider
two instances of an "object" as two separate
objects, but it seems to me that they most
certainly are.  We can only assume that they
are the same object because they perform
in the same way, on the level we care about.

Right, except for certain purposes (which is
usually all that matters).

And the reverse, that two separate things
can really be the same thing (not just two
instances of a class, but identical), seems 
extremely odd, to me. :-(
Here's another slant on the same area:
If you loan me a CD, and I take it to my 
house and copy it, do you now own two
CDs?  I would say not, but perhaps you
(and anyone who supports intellectual
property) would say yes?  I am confused
as to how your position on IP can agree
with mine (as I have seen that it does)
and yet the most basic concept involved
causes a disagreement... Hm.

In a message dated 98-07-06 14:06:14 EDT, you write:

Through what method?   Tea leaves?  Chicken entrails?  Sorry, I shouldn't be
sarcastic, but the idea that someone can "partition" their beliefs in such a
manner seems specious.  Ones beliefs affect anything one does, wether or not
one is consciously aware of this.  This person may strive to eleminate any
"contamination" of his work by his beliefs.  He will fail.  He can't help it.
They aren't something he thinks about rationally, they are his beliefs,
founded on and nurtured by his faith in them.  It would be impossible for such
a person to be both sane and to compartmentalize their thinking in such a way.

It seems odd to me that a creationist is found to be able to separate his
beliefs from his work, but if an athiest applied for that same position and
publicly called himself such, he'd stand about as much chance of getting the
job as I would of flapping my arms and taking flight.

You tell me, and we'll both know - I'm not a statistician.

A number of years ago there was a study done in Germany (I think)
which showed a positive correlation between the reduction in the birth
rate and the reduction in the crane population.  Amazingly, almost every
peak and trough in the crane population was reflected in the birth rate.

So, do cranes deliver babies in Germany?

Anecdotal connections between gun ownership and crime rates mean
very little to me.  I'm neither pro nor anti gun, though I'm for the * right * to
own a gun. With regard to the connection between crime rate and gun
ownership,  I'm sitting on the fence until someone with a big and logically
powerfull enough documented study knocks me off; and untill then I'm
staying firmly put.

Malthus showed that certain assumptions implied subsitence wages.  Those
assumptions were reasonable for several thousand years before Malthus.
Just his bad luck that the world had fundamentally changed about when
he did his analysis.

Other assumptions, the ones you obviously prefer, and which have been valid
for the last two hundred years, imply increasing per-capita wealth as
population increases.  You acknowledge one of those assumptions, available
resources, but don't seem sufficiently aware of other assumptions made:

1. The resources need to be close enough at hand; without FTL-travel,
it's very hard to see how resources billions of light years away can support
current population growth rates over the next 10,000 years.

2. The technology of reproduction has to not get lots better.  Per-capita
wealth can increase if wealth increases faster than population.  But with
upload technology, for example, populations can increase much faster than
it seems plausible for wealth to increase.  With uploads, Malthus'
assumptions may well become reasonable again.  (See

The Introduction of Robin's insightful article reads:

"Many technological enthusiasts, impressed by the potential of various
envisioned technologies, have speculated that technology may soon become so
productive as to induce a "singularity", a period of extremely rapid
growth. (A collection of speculations can be found here and here.)"

Robin addresses how rapid this may come about and what it would take for
technology to propel the economy to grow so fast.   A great read!

Historical parallel in action!  I'd like to use this quote in my Memetic
Toolkit.

It would be wonderful to gather historical incidents that show that what
was once consider to be at ridiculous, outlandish and pie-in-the-sky
thinking, that have actually come to fruition.  

This can be done by locating quotes over the years in which individuals
have discounted forward thinking possibilities and then to have these
statements refuted by way of example: flying  to space exploration;
incurrable illnesses to overcoming death; dealing with barren women to
fertility innovations; sex segregation to sex choices; sacrilege in
tampering with the body to germline and somatic engineering; aging to
cosmetic surgery; environmental alarmist claims to extropian environmental
views; et cetera.

Title
  Cholesterol-lowering effect of barley bran
  flour and oil.
Source
  Journal of the American Dietetic Association.  94(1):65-70, 1994 Jan.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of adding barley bran
  flour and a barley oil extract to a fat-modified diet on
  serum lipids in persons with hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN:
  The basic design of the study was a randomized, 30-day intervention trial. It
  included a neutral-fiber control group and a 1-week preintervention period
  for the collection of baseline data. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 79 men and
  women with hypercholesterolemia. Subjects had a mean age of
  48.2 years, and all completed the study. INTERVENTION: All participants were
  instructed to follow the National Cholesterol Education
  Program (NCEP) step 1 diet and were randomly assigned to one of three
  treatment groups: 20 g added cellulose, 3 g added barley oil
  extract, or 30 g added barley bran flour. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol were measured, along with serum triglycerides,
  before the intervention, at week 1, at week 3, and at the end of the
  intervention. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Student's paired t test was
  used to detect significant changes within each treatment group from baseline
  to the end of the 30-day intervention. In addition, Pearson's correlation
  coefficients were used to detect significant correlations between the
  variables measured. RESULTS: Addition of barley bran flour
  significantly (P = .0001) decreased total serum cholesterol
  (-0.60 mmol/L) as did addition of barley oil (-0.50 mmol/L;
  P = .002) after 30 days of intervention. Similarly, LDL-C decreased 6.5% with
  addition of barley bran flour (P = .036) and 9.2% with
  addition of barley oil (P = .003). Total serum
  cholesterol or LDL-C of the cellulose control group did not
  decrease significantly over the same period. HDL-C decreased significantly in
  the cellulose control group and the barley bran flour group
  (-0.15 mmol/L, P = .012, and -0.15 mmol/L, P = .006, respectively), but not
  in the barley oil group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that
  addition of barley bran flour or barley oil
  enhances the cholesterol-lowering effect of the NCEP step 1
  diet in individuals with hypercholesterolemia.

Title
  A high biotin diet improves the impaired glucose tolerance
  of long-term spontaneously hyperglycemic rats with non-insulin-dependent
  diabetes mellitus.
Source
  Journal of Nutritional Science & Vitaminology.  42(6):517-26, 1996 Dec.
Abstract
  The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat, serving as a spontaneously
  diabetic model with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
  (NIDDM), exhibits impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at about 16 weeks of age.
  In this study, we investigated whether or not biotin, a
  water-soluble vitamin, improved the IGT of OLETF rats. To this end, we
  administered diets containing one of three levels of biotin,
  a high-biotin diet (BH), a normal-biotin
  diet (BN) and a basal-biotin diet (BB), to OLETF rats up to
  24 weeks of age. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed four
  times between 13 and 22 weeks of age. The administration of a BH corrected
  the IGT of OLETF rats. Upon further investigation, we found that insulin
  secretion in the OLETF-BH rats was decreased to a significant extent,
  signaling that the hyperinsulinemia typical to the OLETF-BH rats had clearly
  improved. Body weights were significantly lower in the OLETF-BH group than in
  the other OLETF groups, even though the OLETF-BH rats showed a significantly
  higher average daily food intake. The body weight gain of the OLETF-BH rats
  followed the same tendency as the control-LETO (Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka)
  rats (LETO-BB and LETO-BN). These results demonstrate that a high-level

Title
  Pharmacological and clinical studies of ephedrine and other
  thermogenic agonists. [Review] [12 refs]
Source
  Obesity Research.  3 Suppl 4:537S-540S, 1995 Nov.
Abstract
  When given as a supplement to an energy restricted diet the sympathomimetic
  agent ephedrine, in combination with methylxanthines such as
  caffeine, improves fat loss by dual actions: a central
  suppression of appetite and peripheral stimulation of energy expenditure
  covered by fat oxidation. Mean weight loss was found to be 16.6 kg after 6
  months when E+C was given as an adjuvant to an efficient hypoenergetic diet,
  which was 3.4 kg higher than in the placebo group. An additional 24 weeks
  treatment with E+C prevented relapse. In the first weeks of treatment E+C
  offset the hypotensive effect of energy restriction and weight loss, but the
  effect was transient, and after 8 weeks blood pressures were
  indistinguishable from those of the placebo group. E+C has no adverse effect
  on glucose and lipid metabolism, but has been shown to prevent the decline in
  HDL-cholesterol caused by weight loss. In a comparative trial the weight loss
  produced by E+C was similar to that of dexfenfluramine. More research on
  sympathomimetics and methylxanthines should be carried out to identify
  combinations with improved efficiency and safety. Moreover, more long-term
  trials and studies in males are required. [References: 12]

Do so, but remember that this can cut both ways: many new agers and
pseudoscientists similarly use this technique ("Nobody thought
heavier-than-air flying was possible, so why can't levitation be
possible?").

Perhaps the cases could be strengthened by showing the evidence that
existed in the time the original claim already pointed in that
direction. Birds showed that heavier-than-air flight was possible
etc. The moral outrages are especially revealing since they show how
far we have come and can make people think about their own views: are
they any less silly and conservative.

True, it's a relatively small percentage in (in developed
countries at least), but that relatively small group is
responsible for a huge percentage of crimes (for example,
it's not uncommon for youth groups to mug dozens of people,
break into a number of houses and rob a couple of gas stations
before they finally get caught. And when they get cought...well,
they walk! And there we go again. My approach would decimate
the hard core of crime, making the country a *lot* safer, almost
instantly.

Actually, there's (just like with the criminals) a "hard core" of
(often drunk) trouble makers that get police visits on a regular
basis because of domestic violence etc. Most people *don't* fly
into uncontrolled rage, just as most people aren't hardened criminals.
I'm quite sure that after a couple of months of new justice, there
would be only a shadow of the former random/domestic
violence/neighborhood disturbance statistics. Most offenders would
either be dead or in jail. And for once the meek would inherit the
streets...

Fact: most attackers are agressive, strong men. Many of the victims
are not (old people, women, children). Guns are the equalizer. 
Other weapons (like tasers) are either unreliable or require 
close contact (knives, bats etc.) and a very considerable risk of 
injury to the victim, plus they don't work well against groups, so 
they're hardly an option.

What this clearly shows is that even transhumanists are heavily
influenced by the culture of the region they happen to live in,
they're not the free-thinking, borderless types they often claim 
to be. Well, most of them anyway; there are always exceptions...
(Yeah, like me -- being Dutch I should be firmly anti-gun, anti
death penalty (well, at least in public) etc, but I'm not. At the
same time, I'm not some "right wing" type either, being atheistic,
for progress, for full legalization of abortion, euthanasia, drugs,
prostitution, for empowerment of women etc. But I don't buy into
the "all people are equal" crap and other such mindless rebellions
against a former era). Maybe you should look at your beliefs too,
and try to figure out what's plain bullshit and propaganda (every
generation has its own brainwashings, but most people only find
out afterwards, if they ever find out at all) and what really makes 
sense.

Actually, so that when faced with a crazed drunk you can take him
out effectively, instead of either being paralized with fear/missing
and shooting someone else/yourself etc. Even the best shooter 
won't be helped much by this training when properly drunk/stoned,
but his potential victims will have a *great* benefit from such
training (maybe even being good enough shooters to shoot him without
killing him, though that wouldn't be much of a loss). Note: many
(most) people are *not* burly bar fighers, who don't need a weapon
to take on an agressive drunk male.

Maybe for the first couple of months, yes, as the new approach goes
trough its labour pains, so to speak. After that, most of the dangerous
hotheads and criminals will either be in jail or dead, and in any
case without a gun permit. Those that remain (the *vast* majority)
are the sensible people who can control themselves if necessary.
To drag out another cliche: "an armed society is a polite society"
(due to forces of natural selection, if nothing else).

It's certainly finacially feasible, because the private sector carries
a significant portion of the costs, the system can be expanded over the
years, whenever funds become available and if you start mass-producing
things like surveillance cams, the price will drop. In any case, lots
of private people and governments think this is a good idea, and it's
only a matter of time before we do have safe corridors and the like.
England is a good example of how quickly such technology can get
acceptedand implemented, and how very effective it is. As long as only
public places have gov cams, I don't see any serious privacy issues.

Obviously not, because, as the name says, he's an *executioner*,
not a *murderer*. Murder = illegal killing, execution = *legal*
(sanctioned by law) killing. It's the context that counts. The
murderer kills "innocents", the executioner kills murderers.

Actually, this kind of justice goes a lot further back than the OT, and
yes, some things have a timeless value. I don't give a crap whether
some method is mentioned in the bible or not, as long as it works.
Equal retribution is as fair as you can get with justice, other methods
are completey arbitrary.

On the contrary, without years of appeals it would be considerably
cheaper than the present justice systems. Furthermore, it would be
automated wherever possible to further increase speed and efficiency,
and reduce costs.

Sounds interesting...Btw, if it's just for yourself, politics
don't matter much as you're simply the king of your spot.

Yes. But this still doesn't prevent people for having utterly
contradictory beliefs and insisting that they make complete
sense. 

People suffering from anosognosia have paralysis on the left side of
the body, but doesn't know they are sick; when presented with evidence
that they are paralysed they instead think that there is somebody else
who is sick or that they were paralysed in the past but not now. OK,
anosognosia is a biological error (I don't believe fundamentalistm is,
despite the attraction of the idea ;-) but shows that it is possible
to be otherwise entirely rational and have utterly contradictory
thoughts.

A fundamentalist geologist can simply decide that all the talk about
geological age, fossils and plate tektonics is a convenient shorthand
for various geological phenomena that *really* are due to the deluge,
but since they form a consistent system and enable him to deal with
his colleauges he can "play along" when it comes to practical matters. 

It is all a questions of cognitive schemas and how we assimilate
information into them, and more rarely accomodate the schemas to fit
new information. Since the later is hard and requires effort, we tend
to assimilate information that fits, force stuff that doesn't fit into
the schemas anyway, or even ignore contradictory information. The
partitioning just means one avoid accomodation by having very broad
schemas where contradictions doesn't matter. Awful? At least to people
like me who want to think rationally, but it is really used by people.

This is true. When I brought up the PunkNet idea
(http://i.am/punknet) on the cypherpunks list some years ago,
there was quite a bit of discussion regarding how to set up an
unbreakable communications network over intercontinental
distances. There weren't a lot of decent responses, as the
problem is non-trivial.

But local nets, yes, are a good idea. I'm working on doing
something on a metropolitan scale across Melbourne, Australia,
I'll let anyone interested know how it pans out.

This is true, and why I think such preparations are massively
useful, although hopefully won't be required. But I think it
would be foolish to assume humanity will just peacefully evolve,
based on our past, just as much as I think it would be foolish to
immediately hole up in a salt mine with a bunch of tesla cannons
and robotic railguns.

I think that looking at the history of the last 200 years will
give anyone rational food for thought.

Well, no, I am certainly not going to prepare for the worst. If I
were going to do that I'd be figuring out how to convert an
asteroid into some sort of stealth generation ship and getting
the hell away from everyone else, and that's just silly.

Like everything else in life, it's not a binary choice, it's
heavily weighted. I'll prepare for the worst I'm prepared to
prepare for  :-)

Nuclear bunkers are just silly, as they are already targets.
You'd want something new, although given current spy satellite
capabilities you'd want something you could convert, like an old
mine somewhere remote.

You most certainly would not want something *already* identified
on some catalogue somewhere as a current or ex-military target.

Well, this is one of my long term plans. Not because I'm a
survivalist nut, but because I like the idea of a small
self-contained community to go and hang out in from time to time.
And if it's in the middle of, say, the Pacific when WWIII starts,
well, so much the better. 

you'd have to take some care that you aren't seen building
bunkers etc on the place, though, as curious military nuts would
come along and investigate.

So I was informed today. But if it isn't open subscription, how
would you filter the subscription requests? I could probably get
on as I know some transhumanist types, but what if I were new to
net but fascinated by this sort of thing?

I think exclusionary lists are self-defeating in the long run, as
people will get bored with each other.  You need open
subscription lists. If people don't fit in, they'll go away
eventually.

Well, I must admit from my own experience that i'm sick to death
already of arguing pro/anti guns, and arguing libertarian
politics. I'm not sure how relevant it is to the list as opposed
to relevant to some listmembers. But I have a bad habit of
arguing with people if I think they are wrong  :-/

Um. Why is it possible to find this list in hotbot? Why isn't it
closed to search engines?

I find the prospect of having my postings readable by the whole
internet quite disturbing, as I may well feel free to say some
things here which I might not want to be known about by the
general public.

Just some throughts as relating to transhumanism. 

The great strength of the asian systems is that they are flexible
(i.e. don't break down because some people doesn't believe in them or
because everything doesn't fit) and have a "systems view" of
things. The drawback is that they tend to get stuck in 'cycles',
seeking to adapt to and accept the status quo rather than change the
situation since change will in the long run just return to the origin.

I think one could make an interesting synthesis of the eastern
'cyclical' point of view and the western 'linear' point of view (ouch,
these terms are tired!); a transhuman philosophy that realizes the
possibility of irreversible change and progress through both
deliberate and self-organized change without getting caught in dualism
or comfortable passivity.

Just so.  In the sf novel VALENCIES (written with Rory Barnes) I posited a
world with instant wormhole access anywhere, plus rejuvenated longevity and
fecundity, in which all the likely earth-like planets in the entire
universe were plausibly filled by natural increase (to the tune of some 2
billion people each) by... 4004 AD.  Make it 2 trillion each and you only
add 10 doublings - circa 4300 AD.  Dismantle the planets, then the stars...
still runs out pretty fast.

In my rough draft, I note such possibilities thus:

==============

So a modest proposal for the first immortal generation, and its successors,
is that world population will first pass through a demographic transition
into replacement fertility, plateau out within some 50 years, while adding
an additional doubling as the old fail to die.  Will rejuvenated, healthy
women add their own new generations of babies to the crush?  The most
conservative expectation is that they will not, because fertility is
limited by the number of follicles retained in the ovaries.  These have
existed since a women was a foetus, and are not renewed.  It is possible
that telomerase therapy might reawaken the stem cells in expired ovaries,
but that seems more like a prescription for cancer.  It is also possible
that nanotechnology could rewire an aged body to a renewed fertility, but
that is an option most people might care to disregard.  

But we need to remember than these high-tech innovations will arrive
bundled with many others.  At the moment, human cloning (in the sense of
growing a new baby from an adult's differentiated tissue) is still widely
regarded as repugnant and even illegal.  In March, 1997, just ten days
after Dolly the cloned sheep entered the headlines, President Clinton
uttered a predictable pious executive announcement in the Oval Office.
`Each human life is unique, born of a miracle that reaches beyond
laboratory science.  I believe we must respect this profound gift and
resist the temptation to replicate ourselves.'  That opinion resonated
within many hearts, but I do not think it will long remain ironclad.
Somewhere, soon, human babies will be born from this technology, carried in
human wombs, and it will be quite apparent that they are just like all
other babies.  

A little later, artificial wombs will sustain the lives of babies for the
full nine and a half months from conception (cloned or otherwise).  They
will be used at first to keep alive children who otherwise would have
perished in the womb - but sooner or later this technology will surely
become commercially available to parents who do not wish to bear their own
children, or cannot, or are too old to do so.  And after that - why, even
if rejuvenated women have lost their own follicles, and it remains too
dangerous to try to regrow them, there will always be the option of having
cloned or recombined children who spend the first months of their lives in
a life support system as snug as any womb.

If that sounds far-fetched, it is tame compared to other possibilities that
science holds out to us.  If it ever becomes feasible to replace parts of
the failing brain with cyber-implants, designer neurons that take up the
burden of failing brain cells as artificial hearts and kidneys are
beginning to do with those organs, we may reach a stage where people are as
much prosthesis as original.  If nanotechnological computers as small as
matchboxes, or even tinier, can contain as many working neurodes as the
brain contains neurons, we might all carry a kind of back-up redundant copy
of each module in our brain's circuitry.  What happens then when the
protein brain fails in senescence, dies in some last hopeless contest with
infection, or is smashed in an accident?  If the back-up `black box' system
is multiply-wired throughout the organic brain, you won't even know that
your original brain has perished!  
Indeed, having a constant on-line back-up unit inside your head (or beaming
its vast number of bytes to a distant safe site via a kind of cell-phone
grid, perhaps linked world-wide through satellites and optic cables) will
allow you to shift your point of view, of consciousness, between your body
and anywhere else you choose.  You would be a disseminated mentality, your
awareness stretched effortlessly across the entire globe (but you will need
to get used to the psychic whiplash and `motion sickness' of changing
point-of-view too quickly or too far).  Once your mental functions are at
least aptly coded into a machine, it will also become possible to create
coding `hand-shaking' protocols with the machine substrates supporting
other people's extended consciousness.  It will be a kind of artificial
telepathy, an extended cyber-empathy in which you might merge at least the
fringes of your self into that of a loved friend - or many of them.
Ultimately, we might find that enhanced humans have become the benign and
transcendental equivalent of Star Trek's Borg, a sort of colony organism
with multiple minds, as firewalled as they wish to be or as fluent and
intermingled.

	Wilder possibilities

If such apparently extravagant changes enter the human shopping menu,
matters will not stop there.  If you can upload or back yourself up in a
powerful computer, you can also clone yourself mentally.  That is, you will
be able to purchase a machine (or space in one) and `xerox' yourself as an
independent copy (call it `xoxing', a term coined by a witty
transhumanist).  He or she won't be you, exactly, because the history of
his or her consciousness would start to diverge from yours the moment the
copy was done.  But you would be closer than twins.  Is this an enticing
possibility, or a hideous one?  For many, the shudder they feel at
contemplating this choice is sufficient answer.  Others would wish nothing
finer than the creation of a duplicate self.  My point is simply this:
there are enough people who would happily take up this option, if they can
afford it, that the whole question of overpopulation bursts up anew.
Forget telomerase therapy, and piecemeal fixes to a body smashed
remorselessly by free radicals and virus attack.  If uploaded immortality
and xoxing are on the agenda before the end of the 21st century - as some
computer scientists such as Dr Hans Moravec believe - the first immortal
generation will gradually morph into beings we can scarcely imagine today.

==========================

I'd *still* like to see some informed calculations showing curves for
different postulated changes in population growth given different versions
of rejuvenated longevity, etc.  The Hanson Runaway Upload Option is clearly
so drastic and, um, fertile that almost any outcome will be plausible, but
I assume that less discontinuous changes are more accessible to precise
treatment (along the lines of Dan's claim that one exponential curve is
much like another, something that sticks in my innumerate craw).

A reuters news item on Yahoo at:

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/technology/story.html?s=z/reuters/980706/tech/stories/economics_1.html

Notes that the internet is dramatically increasing the "efficiency" of the
market for many products. Basically, since anybody can now easily find the
current advertized prices, It's very hard for a merchant to charge too much.
According to the article, this is occuring mostly in the US and mostly so far
in business-to-business situations. While acceptance is slow as measured in
internet time, it's very fast as measured in normal time. The article
mentions several possible effects, but I'll make some predictions of my own here.

Basically, we're looking at an increase in market efficiency. This is an
technical economic term that relates to the ease of acquisition of information
and the cost of a transaction (and which I am probably abusing through ignorance.)
Such an increase tends to favor the buyer in the short term, and favors the
more efficient producers over the less efficient producers in the long term.
This ultimately drives down the cost of goods.

I perceive a second effect. The cost of sales should also go down. Basically,
each sales and marketing person should sell more. Essentially, the internet
and the associated host computers are automating much of the sales/marketing
job on the seller's side and much of the purchasing department's job on the
buyers side. In addition, the fact that the transaction is electronic also
minimizes the financial paperwork for buyer, seller, and within the banking
system. Basically, This automates much of the buying, selling, and accounting.

The moral of this story? Just as the PC automated most secretaries and many
middle managers out of existence over the last ten years, internet commerce
will automate many sales, marketing, purchasing, and accounting jobs out of
existence over the next few years. The percentage of administrative personnel
within a company will continue to fall.

That's just not true.  The Soviet Union, which of course had enormously
restrictive gun control laws, was hardly an easy prey to any aggressor.  To
say that mandatory gun registration makes a nation an easy target is to simply
ignore many other far more relevant defense factors.

Do the math.  Five murders per very hundred thousand would be 50 murder per

actually lower than that, although I could be wrong.

Oh, I've heard that mentioned for some time now.  I've also had people point
to examples in foreign countries where guns aren't so easily available and the
number of murders is almost mind-boggingly less.  Noting the widespread
proliferation of firearms amongst this population as compared to many foreign
populations, one could easily thereby provide a counterexample to the above.
Other methods would be to point out that NYC has the toughest gun control laws
and a declining crime rate that is the envy of American cities.  Now of course
you'd say that the decline has more to do with social factors than gun control
laws.  And of course that's exactly what a gun-control advocate would say in
response to your examples.

My point here, since I really do not want to become entangled in a long,
detailed, gun-control debate, is that the facts simply are NOT clear, and that
to claim that gun-control advocates are simply caught up in a meme is to look
at the issue with a very narrow frame of mind.

 
 
<< "Don't bother me with facts...my mind is made up".>>

I have arranged to meet with Dr. Nobuyuki Otsu at MITI's Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba on July 15th as part of my research for my book on transhumanism. Dr. Otsu stated a few other people could accompany me on a tour of the facility and an impromptu demonstration of an agent system that integrates visual recognition and speech. If any extropian list participants are in Japan and wish to accompany me, send me an email. I have heard accounts that this new "virtual human agent" is extremely impressive. I'll let everyone know how things went upon my return.

That's odd; sometime around 1990 I read a comparison between the USSR's gun 
laws and Britain's, and Britain was far more restrictive than the USSR.

Well, my example was intended to generate identical absolute population
curves, not just self-similar curves. The example was a couple who
duplicates (the woman has four kids) at age twenty and dies at forty,
versus a couple that has a pair of kids every twenty years and lives
forever. it turns out I was wrong. For this example, the mortal
population is exactly half again as large as the immortal one. To
get exactly equal curves, the mortals would have to commit suicide
immediately after spawning the four kids. it's easy to see that this
is equal: for each population, every twenty years each couple goes
into the spawning room and four people come out. In the mortal
case, two adults go in and four babies come out. In the immortal case,
two adults go in and come back out carrying a baby each. Same population
growth.

A big problem with sociological and group psychological studies is 
the impossiblity of ethically performing true scientific experiments 
with control groups.

The closest surrogate is the Florida concealed carry laws recently 
enacted. Only a very few of the permit holders have been found guilty 
of misusing their privelege, and the violent crime rates are falling. 


The lowering crime rate coupled with the low percentage of misuse and 
'accidental' shootings looks very much like success for the concept 
of arming the public. At the very least, no harm has been done by the 
law's passage.

Now if cities like Chicago would only try..

You think... see, there's that word again. You *think*... you don't care
enough to actually look the figures up. Oddly, the per-capita figures don't
seem to be available on the Net, but here's a URL for the total murder
rate in NYC in recent years:

    http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/len/i/one.gif

And the reality: more than a thousand murders a year from 1968-1996 and a
peak of nearly 2300. But what's reality when you can *think* instead?

>So your strategy is to to exchange issue-oriented arguments for psychological

No, our strategy is to continue to explain reality to those who prefer
their ideology to facts. You seem to be amongst them.

Whoopee-do. Britain had a lower murder rate than America before any 
anti-gun laws were passed and still has a lower murder rate. Switzerland
and Israel have widespread availability of military weapons and murder
rates not much higher than Britain (about a quarter of the US rates). 
Jamaica and Mexico have extremely restrictive gun laws but murder rates 
about twice as high as the US.

So, you were saying?

>Other methods would be to point out that NYC has the toughest gun control laws
>and a declining crime rate that is the envy of American cities.  

Or pointing out that *DC* has the toughest gun control laws in the US 
*and* the highest murder rate (more than 100 per 100,000 last time I 
checked). You were saying, again?

(and, of course, the reduction in murders in NYC has come from increasing
the clearup rate and hence the risk to murderers, not by new restrictions 
on guns).

>My point here, since I really do not want to become entangled in a long,
>detailed, gun-control debate, is that the facts simply are NOT clear, 

Of course that's only true if you prefer your anti-gun ideology to reality;
amongst independent criminologists the facts are indeed very clear, as you
would have discovered if you'd read the paper I pointed you to yesterday.
Gun control is almost entirely irrelevant to crime rates; there are 
countries with strict laws and lots of gun crimes and countries with lax
laws and almost none. Relaxing those laws does reduce the murder rate, just
as increasing the number of cops, but that's still a small change compared 
to social factors which can make one area a hundred times as dangerous
as another even though the less dangerous area has almost no gun laws
and the more dangerous area bans them almost entirely (e.g. Vermont and
DC).

But like most anti-gunners, you think and feel, you don't bother to
actually study the subject you're ranting about.

The ideal of swift and sure justice is wonderful - as long as it is 
also INFALLIBLE. Until that day arrives, I will be happy to pay taxes 
to support the present system of appeals and proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt before enacting any permanent punishment on anyone. 
In fact, here in Illinois, there have been several celebrated cases 
of prosecutors LYING to make political points off the condemned 
bodies of poor mopes who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Perhaps capital punishment should be put off until the advent of 
perfect justice? Until the state can be absolutely sure of never 
condemming an innocent, they should not have the power of life and 
death.

A person defending himself has the supreme advantage of knowing that 
the person they are shooting is guilty of attempting a crime against 
person or property, and therefore is not constrained by the limits 
that shuold be placed on states.

In the first iteration, you can simply use existing communication matrix:
cellular, two-way pagers, wire telephony and the Internet (soon from
the skies?), overlaying them with a crypted higher-order protocol
(heck, even using ssh or its free GNU clone would suffice just now). 
Afaik encryption is not tolerated in HAM circles, so using existing 
packet radio infrastructure won't be possible. Of course things like 
that will be down in course of a true calamity, so a minimal backup 
capability will be certainly necessary. (This is always assuming the 
calamity is serious, but transient. In case of quantitative holocaust 
there is obviously little need to maintain connectivity).

You talked about spread-spectrum cellular, which sounds very interesting.
Quite a time ago on this list networking-relevant results of Stu
Kauffman's work were mentioned: there is a minimal, low connectivity beyond 
which a randomly connected net experiences a phase transition into a
single contiguous domain. PV-driven (supercapacitor-buffered?) cheap 
spread-spectrum cellulars (think about NEMP when designing these!) 
capable of routing TCP/IP(ng) should be of considerable interest 
to the mainstream wireheads as cheap, low-bandwidth/long-latency 
Internet infrastructure. If enough enthusiasts will be operating these 
(difficult to make such a movement supercritical: you need a 
cheap available kit and a minimal density to make the coverage 
useful for anything), you'll have an alternative communication 
infrastructure. Microwave and line-of-sight diode laser links 
could be also useful.

Albeit this is ridiculous to contemplate just now, lauching your very own
LOSL palmtop relays into LEO should become not too expensive in a few decades.

Right. For starters, getting germtight suits into mass production and
into everybody's living room and making sure the majority can use them 
(remember the suffocated children in Israel during the Gulf war?)
would mean a lot (well, a great deal more than a working protection
against random asteroid impact). They would also offer excellent 
protection against fallout (how many have sturdy basements, a 
supply of clean water, dehydrated food and a basic medical kit, 
atropine, a dosimeter and iodide tablets included?), and limited 
protection against C weapons. Of course this is semiuseless against 
a sneaky attack with long-latency engineered bioweapons (which will 
need sniffers, and continuous population screeing on viral DNA 
kinetics), and certainly useless against a Gray Goo incident as 
in case of a (spontaneous, or engineered) Blight. 
 
In any case will the effort not be wasted, just think of MDR epidemics 
and reactors gone China.

Well, start a list which distributes only signed, crypted 
stuff (is there a hacked majordomo which does this?), and 
is open only to known members. You're virtually certain to draw
interest from the wrong type of people, then, security included. 
The latter has started to be pretty paranoid since the Aum
et al. type of thing.

Title
  Biotin supplementation improves glucose and insulin
  tolerances in genetically diabetic KK mice.
Source
  Life Sciences.  42(13):1323-30, 1988.
Abstract
  Because biotin treatment may lower blood glucose in
  insulin-dependent diabetes, we chose to study such an effect
  in non-insulin dependent diabetes. Twenty-six diabetic KK
  mice, moderately hyperglycemic and insulin resistant, were treated for 10
  weeks: 9 animals with 2 mg of biotin/Kg, 8 with 4 mg of
  biotin/Kg, and 9 with saline (controls). Blood glucose
  levels, oral glucose tolerance, insulin response to oral glucose, and blood
  glucose decrease in response to insulin were quantitated. Compared to
  controls, biotin treatment lowered post-prandial glucose
  levels, and improved tolerance to glucose and insulin resistance. Serum
  immunoreactive insulin levels in biotin-treated mice were
  like the controls.

Our core value -- becoming posthumans -- is only part of 
transhumanism. Just as important are our ideas of how it can be 
achieved. Obviously, many people in the past have wanted to overcome 
their biological limitations and achieve immortality; but they 
haven't known how to go about it. Transhumanism is the first 
philosophy ever to have both the goal of transcending the human 
condition and the practical, technological means to make it happen. I 
think that is quite revolutionary.

I believe we have only seen the beginning. As the amount of 
brainpower involved in transhumanism increases, the intensity of 
intellectual exploration of transhumanist issues will reach new 
levels that will make most of what is being said today look very 
crude and unsophisticated.

For a recent step forward, take for example David Brin's reframing of 
the whole privacy debate.

Indeed; Brin's ranting does seem very crude and unsophisticated. Luckily
his worship of big government is one of the memes which seems to be dying

You completely ignored the argument that I posted along with that sentence,
which was embedded in the middle of it, namely that there will always be
crazies with the intent to do enormous amounts of damage, and that such
crazies will sometimes be able to organize into terrorist cells, and that no
matter how free or minimalist we make government, the terrorist threat will
always exist.  So it's not a matter of getting blown to kingdom come for
principle, but a matter of pragmatism: the way to reduce the threat is not
PRIMARILY by reducing the motivation.  I think that I also said that reducing
the motivation should of course occur and should be a secondary measure.

 Uh-huh... and that won't destroy privacy? Being subjected to arbitrary
 searches and scans by the cops, which will very quickly be expanded to
 include anything else they can scan for? And what will you do when the
 freedom fighters take that as an incentive to strike now?>>

The Energy Department has had a program for some years dedicated to the
development of such devices, and they've come a long, long way in the
inception of it.  As far as, say, being scanned automatically when I enter a
dense population area, or any public, for nuclear/biologica/chemical weapons I
can say that I don't regard that as an invasion of my privacy. If I don't have
any such weapons, the scan will tell them nothing.  

Freedom fighters?  Like I said in another post, the term usually refers to
guerilla movements.  I don't know of any guerilla movements in the United
States.  If you're referring to terrorists, like McVeigh, frankly I think it
makes perfect sense to develop such scanning measures BEFORE they lay their
hands on NBC warfare materiel.  That cult in Japan, the Aum, tried using a
variety of biological measures against Tokyo and the HQ of the U.S. Seventh
Flt. in Japan, including the spraying of anthrax spores and the Q fever.  None
had any detectable effect (they were a bit more successful of course in the
subway attack).  I'd rather not wait to develop scanners until the means of
employing biological and chemical weapons are refined enough for organizations
like the Aum, or any with the same intent, to be horribly successful.

Provoking a civil war to eliminate the government in 'Player of Games'? 
I'd say that's direct interference.

But I wasn't talking in terms of outlook, just the basic setup of the
society. Moorcock's is far less socialized than most of the Culture,
but it has the same feel of extremely powerful individuals with too
much time on their hands.

If you can access the Washington Post online, there is an excellent 
article in today's Style section on the Bengali poet Taslima Nasrin, 
who is presently under _fatwa_ (an offer of large monetary reward to 
whoever can find her and put her to death).  The charge--blasphemy.  
The cause--her poetry promotes feminist and secular ideas and has 
become a sensation among young women in Bangladesh.  She has taken a 
stand against religion, fanaticism, and oppression of females.

After escaping to Sweden for a while, she traveled through Europe 
(heavily guarded) and presently is in New York for a few 
months to see if she could live here.  

I found her story a good reminder of just how revolutionary some of our 
most basic ideas are in some parts of the world.

Setting aside the unfortunately inflammatory rhetoric that's been lobbed by

No, merely outcompete them. Government is already a serious drain on the

Possibly not even eighteen months, if we're lucky.

So they can afford to move, they're just scared of doing it? Personally
I could have worked as much as I wanted when I was living out of a
backpack in 1996, I just didn't want to be programming Windows apps
when I had better things to do.

Indeed; so why are you arguing for police-state measures which are
guaranteed to make it worse?

Yes, there will. And the risk to me is?

And the risk becomes even lower, because otherwise they won't have the
power to cause those enourmous amounts of damage for a long time.

You have evidence of this? That the risk to me from crazies in a minimal
state is higher than the proven risk of letting governments take more
power (governments have murdered far more people this century than private
killers)?

You reduce the threat by *increasing* the motivation? Bizarre.

And when a new law is passed to scan you for things you do carry, what
will you do? Go to jail, I presume. Does the phrase "innocent until proven
guilty" mean anything to you?

>If you're referring to terrorists, like McVeigh, frankly I think it

McVeigh was not a terrorist in his mind, but a freedom fighter. Do you
seriously expect me to believe that he would have blown up that building
if Waco had never happened? Yet you're arguing for more Wacos, while I'm
arguing for less. Which will be more successful at reducing the number
of attacks by the McVeighs of the world?

Exactly. No detectable effect, even with the level of funding and dedication
that they had... and note that one of their attacks was against the US
government, and wouldn't have happened had that government not existed. I
don't know what the motivation for the other attack was.

Yes, but it was Special Circumstances... :-) 

It seem that the Culture strategy is to use minimal force to change
things, leaving the actual change largely up to the other
civilization. In PoG they crashed the system, but let the Azadians
start building a new (with some subtle help to avoid getting trapped
in the old attractor). The various wars in Use of Weapons were
similar: just add Zaklave to any already existing military conflict to
make the outcome certain. The major exceptions seem to have been
Excession (where minimal force might not have been applicable to reach
the Affront) or Consider Phlebas, but both novels deal with 'non
equilibrium politics'.

I haven't read the books, but one thing that amuses me is the idea
that very powerful beings will have too much time on their hands. I
expect the opposite. :-)

The New York Times reports that in Japan 2 calves were born that were clones 
of adult cows. The Japanese researcher Dr. Mitsuo Kita used methods pioneered 
by Dr. Ian Wilmut that produced Dolly, but he has not written a full 
scientific report on his experiment yet because the calves were only born two 
days ago on Sunday July 5 1998, but all the biologists the newspaper contacted 
say Dr. Kita has an excellent reputation and the report is probably true. 
If so these are the first clones made from an adult since Dolly, proving that 
she wasn't a fluke and it can be done in species other than sheep.

But it is also important to make sure transhumanism does not become
known as a form of pseudoscience or a cult; this is what I want to
prevent by making people think a bit about the image they present. If
no new thinkers come to us because we appear to be crazy or evil we
will not be able to grow or extend our ideas. It is right now, while
transhumanism is still young and malleable that we must take most care
of it.

concept fully. There are several different
scenarios I’ve heard:

1) The point where population growth apparently
goes infinite and that *something* must happen at
this point. For instance, we all upload and we
really can have an infinite population. This, I
think, is stretching statistics a little too far.

2) Artificial Intelligence speeds up the creation
of more powerful computers and intelligence’s.
This seems wrong because hardware and software
power is already a major factor in the increase of
hardware and software power. There is no reason to
suggest this trend would suddenly change.

3) A Super Intelligence emerges from a distributed
network, such as the Internet. I think this goes
against current network/software/hardware models
and that a distributed intelligence would only
emerge under certain (possibly engineered)
circumstances that current trends in hardware,
software and the economy would not support.

Otherwise it is just treated as the point beyond
which we cannot predict (sometimes called the
Horizon). Although the curves are certainly moving
upwards I see no evidence that we should get ready
for a sudden surge in power, the collapse of world
government, the onslaught of Super Intelligence’s,
etc.

Anyone care to fill me in?

But the problem does not create the distinction;
the distinction creates the problem. You believe
there is a distinction, you upload and die. I
believe there is no distinction, I upload and
live. Go figure!

You also touched on the idea that consciousness is
lost when you sleep. I think there's some
confusion between consciousness as a medical term
(i.e. "he lost consciousness" and "he is
unconscious") and consciousness in the context of
philosophy (i.e. "I think therefore I am"). I
would argue that consciousness does not exist in a
sense that it can be lost. Like music, it can be
played again, on different instruments at
different times.

People develop a fear of sleep for the very same
reasons, and can we say it is the same person when
the wake up? Observers will say it is the same
person, science will say it is the same person,
even they will say they are the same person. What
else do we have to go by?

There are no subjective differences (the person
knows who they are), there are no objective
differences (all the atoms, etc are in the right
place and on the right course), so all that is
left is a mystical difference.

I've considered it myself, I no longer think it's

When someone talks of the cogs of a clock
producing the time, it's natural to assume they
mean the actions of the cogs rather than their
"essence" (I'm assuming that's what you meant).

Most people say, "we cannot prove of disprove
consciousness exists" most do not realise this is
actually longhand for saying, "consciousness does
not exist." I feel like I exist, but I'm hardly
likely to feel like I don't exist.

That may well be true, but in this case we do not

I'm not sure of the ability for consciousness to
expand and grow. If we take the now exhausted
instrument and music analogy, this whole exercise
seems ridiculous. But I'm assuming you're now
considering consciousness to be a *thing* that
exist in the brain. I do not think there is
sufficient evidence to reject consciousness as a
product of the brain's functions.

This is slightly different from gradually
replacing the brain cells with engineered
replicas. It assumes the brain can function as
parts, but reconnection 1/4 of the brain to a
brain that's only made up of 1/4 could produce
massive problems (not working for instance). But
for arguments sake let's say this is a plausible
scenario.

I see no difference between this and "cloning" two
brains. If you could do this procedure perfectly
it's unlikely that either person would feel any
discomfort or separation.

I'd like to know how you would actually define
consciousness. Especially the idea of control and
it's ability to expand in this scenario.

I simply used memory transplants as an example due
to the sharing of thoughts being such a difficult
procedure. If two people have sex and then have
each others memory of the act implanted then it is
almost as good as sharing thoughts during the act.
Of course, the actual ability to share thoughts
would no doubt lead to greater pleasure, but would
be devilishly hard to achieve.

If we use the model of a brain as individual
interacting agents (IMO the most compelling)
rather than of centralised control. Then we can
assume that we could destroy everything but your
listening and music appreciation functions and
construct a conscious microphone.

Yes, I would say any self-analysing data processor
would conform to what I consider consciousness.

Certainly it would make for some strange
relationships, but there would still be no
connection between the brains (other than they are
very similar). Simply because two things are the
same does not mean they are connected in any way.

If consciousness is a product of the brain then it
stands to reason that you need one brain for every
consciousness. The structure of the brain wouldn't
allow for multitasking, but with a powerful
computer you might be able to run two minds
simultaneously. This isn't really very different
from two individuals living separate lives in the
real world. The real fun stuff happens with the sh
aring of a body, where one wants to turn left and
the other right. Again this is a lot harder than
it sounds, they way the brain is "wired" to the
body would create some interesting technical
problems.

If the person had no memory of when he or she
received the memories, then they would not
remember feeling any discomfort.

Of course continuing this line of reasoning, we should observe that murder 
rates are a very small contribution to mortality rates.  But people seem
much more interested in talking about murder than about other mortality
causes (e.g. no response to my "Why Do We Die?" thread).  Similarly, people
are much more interested in talking about gun laws than other influences 
on crime.

Drexler puts this technique to good use in Engines
of Creation. The first couple of chapters outline
natural parallels to his ideas (the T-virus, how
blood cell move, how muscles work, etc). I think
this is by far one of the easiest ways of
introducing a new concept.

I disagree that upload copying is so drastic that any outcome is plausible.
A virtue of the Malthusian analysis is exactly that as long as the physically
possible population growth rates are high enough, the outcome is insensitive 
to just how high.  The actual growth rate is determined by other things.

A good point, the other points everyone keeps ignoring is that most
(over 90%) of murders are committed by people who know each other,
and the vast majority of murders are not committed by guns at all,
much less handguns. Two years ago here in Chicago there were some
950 murders, 132 by "kitchen knife", and 117 by "baseball bat", and
one by a so called assault rifle, guess which one got banned?

That was part of the point; why are people so hung up on banning guns when
they're such a small risk to the majority, and essential to the minority
who are most at risk of murder (poor inner-city dwellers)? The answer would
have to be that people are just extremely bad at judging risks, which is
one of the things I've been trying to point out in other threads, and one
of the skills that I think is important to a long-lived being.

Presumably this is -- as, I think, Dawkins pointed out -- because we've
evolved to judge risks which are relevant to our short lifespans and our
instincts are unable to deal with the risks in modern life. We treat
potential minor threats we can see -- like guns -- far more seriously 
than serious threats that aren't as obvious.

I read today that the two calves were delivered several days or
weeks prematurely, and the mother cow unexpectedly died the next day.
So apparently the pregnancy had some complications, which may or may
not have been related to the conditions of the experiment.

There are some very surprising numbers here.  I'll have to look at the
study.  As I read it, the entries in the table are 1 for a base rate,
with lower numbers providing lower mortality and higher numbers
higher.  From the way Robin talked about it, the numbers are actually
ratios of mortality rates, so 1 vs. 3 is a factor of three (with 3
being worse) in how often people die, and similarly .33 and 1 is a
factor of three (with .33 being better).  Presumably the numbers are
not comparable across the tables.

Look at the numbers for Drinking and for weight!  Heavy drinkers and
overweight people have the lowest mortality!  Underweight people and
teatotallers have higher mortality.  That's directly contradictory to
all the reports we've been seeing which would lead us to believe that
underweight might be better than "normal" (i.e. average?), which
should be much better than overweight.  Moderate drinking is supposed
to be better than teatotalling, which is much better than heavy
drinking.  Can these numbers be right?   Or am I misreading the whole
table?

I believe the numbers in all the other tables, but I didn't realize
being male was such a handicap.

This rocked my world, because longitudinal studies on gender 
reassignment occur about as often as blue mice:  

Today's issue of the AMA Journal _Pediatrics_ 
contains a study that has the potential to radically alter the concept of 
immutable gender.  (It also raises some disturbing ethical questions 
the choice of the child involved)  It involves the second case of sex 
reassignment of a child who suffered an accident during a 
circumcision, who was then reassigned as a female. This differs from 
the first case in that it was successful. Rather than 
try to explain it here, let me refer you to an online summary at:

http://www.abcnews.com/sections/living/DailyNews/gender980706.html

The online _Pediatrics_ has not yet upgraded their website to show the 
new table of contents or any abstract of the study--I will post an URL 
when we find one.

Essentially then, your rational ethics doesn't tell us what we ought to do,
but rather how we should go about doing whatever it is that we think we
ought to do.  Which leaves open a niche for a new ethic, one which tells us
what we ought to do....  Perhaps you can see what I meant by calling this a
problem shift--it's a bit like the ancients inventing a new and prior god
to explain where god came from.

What is needed is a rational metric to judge our goals.  It's a pity that
some of the ancient gods aren't around anymore to serve in this capacity;
they seemingly offered the prospect of an objective judgement.

Actually, there is one objective metric available, one which we are
currently being judged against, and which our ancestors have all been held
accountable to: reproductive success.  This is the only bedrock that I know
of upon which to build a rational ethics.  It doesn't meet your
generalization principle, which is to say that the generalization principle
doesn't deal well with reality....

You're not misreading it.  But I didn't include the confidence intervals
from the paper.  The 95% confidence interval for the heavy drinking coeff
of .85 is .46 to 1.59, and for the overweight coef of .94 is .72 to 1.23.  
You shouldn't take small differences very seriously here.

One effect of an armed populace would be that those who could not 
handle the responsibility and would end up using their gun illegally -
 at which time they would be taken out by others. This is the most 
distressing effect of allowing many people to go armed, but it might 
be less harmful to society at large to have a few killings by 
'hotheads' who are themselves taken care of, sooner or later, by the 
majority, than the present system where the only persons you are 
likely to meet who are armed are criminals or the police..

As far as 'hothead' goes, I, too, might not have survived to my 
creaky old age had I lived in this kind of society. But then, if I 
had been born even 200 years ago, I would most likely have been a 
street beggar, assuming I had lived that long, due to my terrible 
eyesight...

I see only two options to control the present crimewave. One is to 
immediately allow all law abiding people who are qualified through 
tests to carry a weapon to do so, while eliminating all consentual 
(drug, sex, and morality) crimes from the books. The other is a 
complete police state with 1984-like surveillance and arrests of 
anyone who even appears to be thinking about violating the law. 
Recent history makes me fearful we are heading toward solution #2.

All ham transmissions are required to be in clear, or in encoding 
that is easily decoded by anyone who cares to listen in. Any use of 
the ham bands for commercial purposes, or in some countries, to allow 
third parties who are not licensed, is prohibited. In the US, it's 
also illegal to use the radio to avoid a long distance phone call if 
the long distance is right there and useable. Kind of takes all the 
reason out of becoming a ham, in my book - but that part of the law 
is mostly ignored by hams and rarely enforced by Uncle Charlie..

If you can afford it, space on commercial launch vehicles is just 
around the corner. If your satellites get annoying to Uncle, he may 
want to test out his shiny new Star Wars laser you just paid for with 
your taxes, though..Most likely you will need to get SOME 
government's permission to put anything into orbit through legal 
means.

If the Soviets could get Sputnik into orbit in 1957 using 1940's 
tech, it's conceivable that some suitably encouraged private parties 
could at present throw together a LEO launch vehicle and get it up 
without governmental interference..

We keep having this rehash over and over.  Neither side gets convinced
by the other.  Both sides accuse the other of mystical or unverifiable
assumptions.  I still have never understood the idea that if we can
duplicate all the functions of a human that the human would then
consider suicide.

I have an identical twin.  Many people claim they can't tell us apart.
I still want *my* body preserved cryonically for future animation.
Preserving his body does me no good.

Now some people will say that they can use nanites to make his atomic
structure more like mine.  No matter how close they get to duplicating
me, I still want to survive independent of my brother.  Even if his
thoughts and memories are modified to mimic mine, I still won't commit
suicide.

Finally, nanites get my brother so close to being a duplicate that there
is only one atom different.  That last atom is fixed, and suddenly we
are identical duplicates.  I do not see that anything mystical has
happened.  I will not suddenly decide to kill myself now.  Even if my
functional ideas, thoughts, and appearance lives on, I'm still the same
person I was before, including the desire not to die.

There is no mystical connection between the two bodies.  My experiencial
reference point of being inside this body won't suddenly change to start
experiencing being inside the other body.  That other body may be
programmed to "remember" my thoughts, even though they never happened to
that body.  It may be programmed to "remember" that it was in this body,
and then suddenly it was in that body.  But that doesn't change my point
of reference, that I am in this body, and that I still want to live.

If you would kill yourself because there is an exact copy that goes on
living, this suggests other questions.  Would you let yourself be
tortured to death because there is an exact copy that goes on
untortured?  Would you let yourself be sold into slavery, because there
is an exact copy of you that is still free?  Even if "one" of you goes
on with the desired outcome, the version of "you" that was the first
will go on to experience the undesired outcome, up to and including
death.

It might be safe to say that it refers to possibly existing aspects of reality

I don't agree that it's merely an assumption.  I think that the facts that we
are all very similar creatures physically, that we developed via evolution,
and a number of other facts could lead one to make the strong case that the
exisence of consciousness in other beings provides the best explanations of
their behaviors.

Oh... ok, I see now.   But we wouldn't be the written record of the program,
but actual execution of it.  And while the program might tell us how the
machine is <g> executing us and thereby creating us, the execution itself is
not necessarily information, even though it can of course provide information.

I suppose that I'm very relunctant simply because I haven't given a software

while I am very familiar with the brain in a vat analogy.

Your original comment was: Nothing can provide anything but information.  And
you very conveniently quoted that in your reply.  But I don't see the link
between this final comment, and that first comment.

So every cause and effect sequence is NOT an instance of language?

It does not *necessarily* change the behavior of the object.  Whether it does

comprehends meaning.

I really hate to cut up your argument like this, but it'll probably save time
in the end.  I did NOT say that behavior provides zero evidence as to whether
an object has mental states or not.  I said that a ribosome would not
*necessarily* act differently if CAU really meant something to it, that is,
that it expressed a certain concept that the ribosome understood.  It might be
that the ribosome would think to itself, Oh!  CAU!  Okay, time start producing
x protein...

I didn't reply to the last part of the argument because it was based on the
misunderstanding.

<< One other thing, although our internal mental states and emotions may be

 something like that conscious.>>


I don't think that we can deduce meaning from behavior, for reasons already
stated; furthermore, the absurd conclusion which you argued against was never
drawn by me, so the above conclusion, elegant though it may be, simply won't
carry.

I'm not.

If you're going to be thinking only of yourself then this discussion will

be done to many of the institutions that provide much of the stability in this
society could have and probably would have a detrimental effect on your
welfare.

 You have evidence of this? That the risk to me from crazies in a minimal

 power (governments have murdered far more people this century than private
 killers)?>>

You're arguing that it is more dangerous to let the government STUDY (which is
how this discussion began) terrorist groups so that tactics with which to most
effectively counter them, within legal parameters, than it is to ban the
government from conducting such studies and developing such tactics?

Well now that depends.  An effective counterterrorist force with effective
tools might serve to reduce the motivation of terrorists to attack certain
targets in particular ways.  The presence of the Secret Service, for instance,
reduces motivation to attack the president.  While terrorists are for the most
part psychotic, they are not necessarily suicidal.

I'm not talking about any such new laws.  And the phrase means a lot to me.

 McVeigh was not a terrorist in his mind, but a freedom fighter. Do you
 seriously expect me to believe that he would have blown up that building
 if Waco had never happened? Yet you're arguing for more Wacos, while I'm
 arguing for less. Which will be more successful at reducing the number

Frankly it doesn't matter much to me WHAT McVeigh was in his mind.  What he
did was horrible and immoral and caused FAR more damage than good to his
cause.  But that's completely besides the point.  As is Waco or similar
situations.  Nowhere have I argued for MORE such situations.  Your entire
reply here is way off the mark.

 Exactly. No detectable effect, even with the level of funding and dedication
 that they had... and note that one of their attacks was against the US
 government, and wouldn't have happened had that government not existed. I
 don't know what the motivation for the other attack was. >>

Yes, an attack was made on the U.S. government, and yes, if the government did
not exist obviously it could not be attacked.
Yes, there was no detectable effect, except for the subway attack.

But, terrorists will undoubtedly acquire more knowledge of the effective
implementation of NBC warfare; the Aum example was merely to show that such
attacks are quite possible.  If they had more information, and if they weren't
stopped, the number of deaths and injuries caused by them would undoubtedly be
much higher.

Now, I believe that the number given for Dodge City was 5 murders per year,

that'd be about 12.5 murders per hundred thousand in NYC annually, and about

Actually, many police officers attribute, partially, the reduction in murders

<<  >My point here, since I really do not want to become entangled in a long,

 Of course that's only true if you prefer your anti-gun ideology to reality;
 amongst independent criminologists the facts are indeed very clear, as you
 would have discovered if you'd read the paper I pointed you to yesterday.>>

The study by John Lott?  I haven't read it.  Given the sheer amount of
criticism the book has come under, I certainly don't think that it's clear
that the facts are "very clear."  I will try to learn more about it though.

<< Gun control is almost entirely irrelevant to crime rates; there are 
 countries with strict laws and lots of gun crimes and countries with lax
 laws and almost none. Relaxing those laws does reduce the murder rate, just
 as increasing the number of cops, but that's still a small change compared 
 to social factors which can make one area a hundred times as dangerous
 as another even though the less dangerous area has almost no gun laws
 and the more dangerous area bans them almost entirely (e.g. Vermont and
 DC).>>

I think that it depends on the effectiveness of the gun control, much like it
depends on the effectiveness of the increase in the number of cops.

You've come far closer to ranting here than I have.  And you've deviated much

of which is to be inflammatory.  So let's go easy on the self-righteous
champion of the truth act.

Actually, tasers would be an excellent option, except 
that they are not as intimidating as a gun, and here in
the US, at least, they are even more questionable 
than a gun, if you use it.  Tasers are seen as "police"

I dunno about him, but *I* would.  We ban other

too?

But this isn't likely to be a problem, as few
enough people will *want* to leave that the
rural "job market" won't be overloaded.

Moral imperatives are all very fine, *if* there
is a possibility of accomplishing it.  I agree 
with Mark in that I see no way to affect the 
probability of widespread disaster in the near
future.  The Foresight Institute, private launch
companies, and so on are already doing more
than I could do for that, so the next thing to 
worry about is making sure that *I* and my
friends/acquaintences/family survive.  BTW,
I think that this is something we should be 
working on somewhat more actively.

Couldn't the "tomboyish" characteristic in both
individuals be down to chromosomes? And the
reaction of the first patient - rejecting dolls
(is this the current method of defining gender -
dolls or guns?), trying to urinate standing up,
etc. - was, it seems, after he learned of the
operation. In my opinion this is a psychological
(and social) reaction rather than a biological one
(the social attitude towards transgender may have
changed between the two cases). If this were so it
would seem at least some of our assumptions about
gender are wrong. Of course, most of this is
speculation based on limited facts.

I would be interested to see what the researchers
involved made of the characteristics both cases
displayed (and of the connection between the
second cases gender indentity and sexuality).

No, but considered against all objects

anything at all, which is the alternative to
feeling like you exist.

You won't find any argument here. But to me the whole of the electronic music
movement is more than the sum of it's parts. It turned music from being
compositional to non-compositional, a more freeform and trancendant mode. Instead
of the emphasis being on style, lyrical content, and devisive cultural paradigms,
the emphasis is on mind-altering sonic experimentation, where the texture of sound
is more important than the framework in which it appears. Cheap, but high quality
sound effects modules with infinite digital variation have contributed to this
trend.

Well I think that everything is digital and that conciousness emerges out of a
highly predictable finite organization of vast number-crunching and
information-processing. It is only a matter of time before digital music acheives
the complexity that you are speaking of.

Right now, there is a certain peculiar expressiveness inherent in acoustic
instruments. But musical instrument manufacturers know this and have responded with
control interfaces that generate expressive sound. The trouble is there are a lot
more violin virtuosos than there are Korg Wavestation virtuosos (although I am ever
striving to become a member of the latter group) As human society incorperates
digital musical instrumentation into it's cultural landscape i'm sure more people
will become virtuosos on thier respective digital instruments. I think people are
just not used to the kinds of tambres introduced by digital music production tools.
think of how alien Jimi Hendrix' guitar rendition of'The Star Spangled Banner must
have seemed to hammered dulcimer players in Appalaichia. Yet those tambres would
have not been possible without technological advances in guitar electronics, now
similar screeching guitar noise litters pop music, and commercially produced music.

I wouldn't really try attempting simulating bends or slides via MIDI or a similar
digital interface. To me the sounds that used to be produced with non-digital
instruments are irrelevant to futureMusic. I do however implement SYSEX messages to
change the tambre of the sounds I work on. MIDI has it's own unique way of
expressing itself.

I just used the terms cheap disposible and recyclable to illustrate how new
electronic music mimics other aspects of our culture and media. I really didn't
intend for them to be aesthetic judgements.

I really look foward to the day when more of my conciousness can be uploaded into a
musical context. but I do that to a limited extent already. A lot of my spontaneous
expression is stored on my Hard drive in the form of MIDI files. maybe it's only a
very small taste of what's to come (RW DVD-yeah you know me) but nevertheless a
taste!
thank you for your input-it was most welcome! anything that made me think like your
post did must be good!

	The main benefit I see being derived from the electronica revolution 
is the freeing of conceptual genius from the limits imposed by 
performance capability.  Now all who can conceive of music can 
execute it without instrumental virtuosity, by means of programming.  
Certainly this will allow the world to enjoy music which heretofore 
has been born and has died within the isolated subjectivities of 
imaginative virtuosos lacking technical excellence.
	My favorites (in no particular order) are The Orb, Orbital, Future 
Sound Of London, Spacetime Continuum, Aphex Twin, Deep Forest, 
Enigma, Moby, Terre Thaemlitz, Pete Namlook, Bill Laswell, and Tetsu 
Inoue.

Actually, most of these ethical systems presume that you already know what
your interests are, or can figure them out with trivial effort. 
Therefore, using what you know and the ethical formula, you can figure out
what you ought to do.

This is wrong on its face.  Rational ethics says "given what you already
know, act according to this formula."  This equation has two variables,
but one of them is already given, so we can solve for the other.

> What is needed is a rational metric to judge our goals.

You're talking about an ethic which tells us what we should and shouldn't
WANT, not what we should and shouldn't do.  We need no such thing, because
we already have goals and desires, none of which IMO are better than
others in the relevent ethical sense, nor should they be.

Suppose we argued that we only ought to set goals which are morally
praiseworthy (where "praiseworthy" is used in its technical sense.) 
This presents us with the obvious problem:  If I want X, and I have
concluded that I ought to want Y, how do I make the transition?  If I
can't, as I suspect is the case, then this leaves me with an ethic which
states that I ought to do something I can't do.

What is it with you and the ancient gods?  Is this some form of irony?

Don't be absurd.  You use your goals, however derived, within the
generalization principle, because the generalization principle has nothing
to do with deriving goals, nor does it claim to.

John Clark's "Waiting for Zed" has a good discussion about The Identity of
Indiscernables: that if two things cannot be told apart from one another,
then they are the same.  Take a look at this at:

Which purposes?  And for that matter, why should we adopt a definition of
the word "same" which doesn't ever describe anything?  I'd much rather say
that any two things which can't be differentiated are the same and leave
it at that.

Except what's that thing over there having thoughts and (up until

We both own a copy the the CD.  They are identical, the same.  That is

I think you're missing the final step to John's argument: this means that
an experiment observing behavior trying to identify consciousness won't
"necessarily" work.  If an experiment won't necessarily work on an
ontological level, then it's an experiment which can't work at all in the
scientific sense; the results will necessarily be inconclusive because any
results you get may not necessarily demonstrate consciousness.

By `outcome' I had in mind the impact on the world of the new technologies
of self-replication.  I can easily imagine a range of methods which differ
excruciatingly in their impact.  You might need an expensive supercomputer
to upload into.  Or maybe a classy 2025 PC will do, and say 10 percent of
the literate population run off a xox to keep on their belt.  Or maybe
Drextech is needed, but that allows a thousand matchbox sized xoxes to be
produced as cheaply as one.  Or maybe *major* Drextech allows it all to be
done into brains the size of grains of sand, and costing no more than sand
(but also no more conspicuous or energy hungry - until they start *doing
stuff* to the world).

Or am I missing your point?

Start a list that distributes pictures of flower arrangements,

very busy pictures on a boring theme. Hide your actual messages

Are you suggesting, though, that if they
were conscious, that *they* would not
be able to tell themselves apart?  It seems
to me that you are saying that we cannot
tell the difference between two copies
of an object, if and only if it cannot ever
matter.  But it seems clear that if we 
could create an exact duplicate of you,
and shot you or your copy, you would 
most certainly care which one was shot
(I hope.  Anyway, *I* would care. :)

But the fact that each copy is 
owned by only one person
means that you implicitly 
recognize that they are not
the *same* copy, but two 
separate objects, which happen
to be identical.

It certainly indicates that the trends that we are extrapolating must somehow
undergo a change sometime in the near future. In that sense, we are talking
about a relatively sudden (i.e., within 20 years or so) change in a set of
trends that appear to have been reasonable invariant for a long time (millenia).
Yes, this is just playing with numbers. It's still interesting.

Yes, computer hardware and software have been contributing to
the development of the next generation of computre hardware and
software, but this is a relatively recent trend. Software and
hardware development productivity is horrible, and IMO we
are still taking baby steps. A breakthrough is not unreasonable.

In my personal model, the SI is not purely an emergent
phenomenon of the net. The net serves as the raw material
for a directed augmentation of an initial proto-SI that first
emerges as the result of a catenation of a set of development tools
and a human programmer.

OK, let's take something very simple: Moore's law. We all know that
Moore's law is simply an observation of a historical trend and cannot
be assumed to have any predictive power, but the trend is quite
robust and has already survived through several technological
generations. Furthemore, it's fairly easy to see the next several
steps, getting us through the next 20 years without recourse to
fundamental breakthroughs. 20 years of Moore's law gains us another
factor of a million in each of several computer capability parameters.

Instead of asking a radical singulatarian such as myself to comment,

In response to Anders:

I think that the bubble of pseudo-science can be popped. Carl Sagan managed
to investigate and cut through, and left quite a reference of material from
which to draw. If someone who levitates wants to debate his belief in
levitation with me, I'd probably first decide if it is a conversation I'd
like to take on.  Not all battles are worth waging.

It is not my strategy to attempt to influence anyone who is vested in his
beliefs, but to influence by way of example.  Newagers are interested in
life extension (heaven, reincarnation, etc.), and happiness (the god
within) and diet (vegetarians, or at least conscious of diet).   If a
newager with whom I come in contact recognizes in me a sense of well being
- health and happiness - then he would probably want to know what my secret
is.  At this point, I would introduce a few ideas.  Timing is important.

I've had a lot of experience dealing with newagers either in Telluride, or
here in LA - the "center for newagers."  Many of my friends are newagers or
have mystical beliefs.  Over the years, they have come around more and
more; and over the years I have noticed an appreciation from them for my
work.  At my most recent party, two friends who have never shown interest
in transhuman ideas before, were talking about cryonics and a transhuman
Utopia.  Why?  Because they felt safe in my home in an inviting and
hospitable environment they could relax in.

Yes.  The idea is to get people to think critically, and this can be a
dilemma when one's moral issues are at stake.  For us, values are flexible.
 Form most people, values are cemented in their history.  Which brings the
ingredient of understanding, humor and common ground which can take off an
edginess.

I subsequently requested some examples of rational ethics and was directed
to your earlier posts which I read and enjoyed.  Thanks.  You concluded that
your preferred ethical standard is utilitarianism which you described as;

>"The right action is that which is most likely to maximize the total
well-being and total number of all people.<

The second half of that standard is nicely objective and may be easily
measured and appears to be in agreement with Bradley Felton's hypothesis;

> Actually, there is one objective metric available, one which we are
currently being judged against, and which our ancestors have all been held
accountable to: reproductive success.  This is the only bedrock that I know
of upon which to build a rational ethics. <

I generally agree with Bradley.  Behaviors which provided a practical
balance between the survival of self and the survival of others probably had
the strongest adaptive value and had much to do with what most people
currently believe they *should* do.

It's the first part of your statement that still makes me wince.  Your
opinion of what my well-being may or may not be is no more than that. . .an
opinion...purely subjective which was the point I was clumsily trying to
make earlier.  Maybe I don't understand what you mean by rationally derived.
Do you mean rules of mathematical logic must be followed?

Okay. I'm having fun with it, and your arguments have made me less 
pessimistic than before.  

I may as well state one of my main interests in this: whether we'll ever 
have enough computational power to set up a good "breeding ground" 
for AIs -- an artificial environment optimized to produce artifical 
intelligence by means of selective pressure.  Using proctonumerology, I'd 
guess a figure of about 10^40 operations ought to be enough.

I don't know how the proposed nanomechanical schemes work. In 
commonly used electronic schemes, I believe that the depth is O(log N) for 
random access, but the number of operations is O(N log N), at least in the 
schemes I'm familiar with.  Are you absolutely sure that the number of 
operations in a nanomechanical addressing systems is O(log N)?

On a side note, I really need to read "Nanosystems" one of these days...

Okay.  I am, I suppose, trying to see how far we can push the 3d 
architecture idea at this point.  We already do it to some extent -- I am 
told that 20 layers is not that uncommon in a chip -- but I would like to 
know how much further we can go; can we drop the 2020 date?

Okay.  That's quite a non-trivial gain.  Of course, those technologies 
may run into their own problems (remember bubble memories?), but they're 
certainly possibilities I wasn't aware of.

That's not really true.  To do fault-tolerant computation the best known 
overhead, so far as I know, goes polylogarithmically in the size of the 
computation, with some (fairly large) constant factor in front of the 
first term in the polylog factor. 

The error correction schemes you are talking about will buy you a little, 
but ultimately, fixing one bit errors goes only a tiny way to fixing the 
error problem.  Much more powerful error correction techniques are 
needed to really solve the error problem, unless, as in today's 
computers, you have an incredibly low fundamental error rate.  Even 
then, there's a real question of how many operations you want to do.  If 
you "only" want to do 10^{17} operations, then error rates of about 
10^{-17} are fine -- which is why today's computers don't use error 
correctyion.  Presumably, for AI we would like to do far more operations 
than that -- on the order of 10^{30} does not seem unreasonable. 

Assuming a fundamental error rate of about 10^{-5} for reversible 
computation, that implies a heavy error correction overhead.  Doing a 
calculation of how much overhead for error correction would be required 
would take quite a while, but it's safe to say that most of the work going 
on in the computer would actually be error correction, not computation.

If I can find the time, I'll try to look up some of the papers analyzing 
errors in reversible computation.  As I recall, there were a few in the 
early 80s, which I've never read.

I will, thanks.

Those which only require that the object 
perform in a certain manner.  For instance,
we can say that two "Toyota Corrola" cars
are "the same", because they are 
*functionally* the same.  Even if they were
identical in every respect, down to the
molecular level, I am sure you would agree
that we really have *two* cars, not just
one that we are confusing as two.  It is 
convenient  shorthand to say that an 
object which is functionally identical to 
another is the same, but we are now 
reaching territory (uploading, IP, etc) 
where it matters *to the object considered* 
whether it is really the same object, or just 
one which is like it.  As far as I can see, I 
agree with Harvey Newstrom's earlier 
post on the subject.

>And for that matter, why should we adopt a definition of

Well, I agree we need another word, but
until recently "same" worked perfectly
well as it was. :)

Since we cannot differentiate your

I would say that that other person *may*
be the same person, if his consciousness
was not interupted in the transfer.  If there
is a point at which there are two copies
in the same time, then at least one of them
is not the original.

Our present notions of "consciousness" are vague and leave a lot to be
desired. AFAIK, the only thing that makes "me" "me" is the belief that I am
"me". IMHO, this is a software loop in my brain, whose main use is in
social relations.

You have just repeated the Cartesian fallacy, see Dennet's "Consciousness
Explained". There is no spark needed, merely the execution of the "me"
process.

Question is, where is the power source? I was assuming it to be on the earth.

Err. How about trying to maintain some posting etiquette? The list is
noisy as it is, already. Since we are at meta, how's the new ExI list

In one of Arthur C. Clarke's non-fiction books he talks about an experiment
one of those famous dead white dudes (Haldane?) once did with toy guns. He
set up a traditional Western movie 'high-noon' shootout and discovered that 
the person who drew second almost always shot first; the first draw was consciously controlled and hence slower than the second person's instinctive reaction.

On that basis we could say that in most cases the hotheads will be at a
disadvantage.

Of course we could also ignore theorising and actually look at places 
like Florida and Israel where many people routinely carry guns and the 
murder rates dropped significantly, but that's just reality and hence
irrelevant to anti-gun discussions.

If you have bandwidth, set up a webcam acting as a steganographic 
mail or voice reflector. I think open source solutions for this 
exist. Kinda makes Echelon useless on the long run, no? (Of course 
with all these continous stream of buzzwords and PGP signatures, 
reliably coming from a few ten known sources there is a neat little 
realtime-refreshed file in the Echelon database for us already. 
And the same thing for libertarians, and cypherpunks, and Lycaeum 
users, etc. Not that anybody ever looks at them, but at need they 
will be there for retroreference.).

To the first:  quite probably.  To the second:  In neither case, the boy was

I agree that there are sociological issues involved, but the two studies are
grounded in biological phenomena, and they are pointing to a window of
actual biological mutability in babyhood.  I have not yet had the
opportunity to read the full study, probably not until this weekend.

I am very heartened with the promise of evolvable hardware (EHW), GA
acting upon (analog) FPGA. This 

- removes the human programmer bottleneck. All you have is to define
  fitness (which can be as informal as saying "I want a filet mignon") 
- allows very compact/efficient, albeit opaque solutions
- removes the catastrophic failure/brittleness due to unforeseen
  input/hardware failure
- allows extremely large/complex, yet robust solutions
- eliminating the von Neumann bottleneck, allows optimal utilization
  of the transistor resources
- a critical WSI enabler, allowing better than 0.9 utilization of
  silicon real estate
- it scales very well to 3d arrays of quantum dots

I think that the human is just the primer. If the Internet++ is a
suitable substrate, you need just a tiny, nonsentient SI nucleus. If 
network security then is as buggy as today, it will then take over the 
Net in minutes, possibly sneaky, so there is no interruption of service.
The bootstrapping human is then essentially disposable. 

With some effort, today a more or less clever hacker could build a Wintelian
(that will take care of 90% of everything) worm, packing constructive 
buffer overruns together with an IP scanner. As IP addresses of PPP
dialup accounts are typically world-visible, you could participate in
the fun. The worm will not be able to do anything very constructive, 
but only because current computer performance and networking 
bandwidth is so very pathetic and the state of the art in GP is
in statu nascendi. If there is >Tbit FPGA humming in every cellar 
(to better (de)compress your video, to recognize your face and 
your voice, to feed your pets, and to render all the nice VR 
games), interconnected with several GBit links (why, multimedia), 
the situation would seem to be a bit different.

"On February 4, 1998, MSI announced a definitive agreement to merge
with Pharmacopeia, Inc., a leader in application of combinatorial
chemistry and high throughput screening to drug discovery". If you
extrapolate such strong current trends as DNA sequencers, total
organism genome databases, very large organical reaction 
databases, hybrid QM/MM forcefield models, automatical scanning 
of combinatorial synthetic libraries, GA in synthesis planning, 
use of MEMS for combinatorial chemistry, STM/SNOM, you will see that 
not many years from now a device not much larger than a desktop 
will be sufficient to initiate the bootstrap of some kind of a 
molecular autoreplicator very quickly, if used correctly. So 
essentially this would be a problem of knowing how, a threshold 
of which is probably equivalent to a team of pretty good human 
experts. Even a fledgling SI could do it in a few days, probably 
much less. After that it has a) basically optimal hardware 
b) can grow in exponential progression, with very short 
replication times. From the receiving end (you and me), even an
indifferent SI looks very much like a Blight.

Does software exist to do this kind of cryptography? I have read 
stories that uses such schemes. If such exists, I would be interested

Yes it does exist, the key search word here is "steganography" a

This strikes me as a frame of reference problem.  I see three frames; (1)
mine, (2) my copy's, and (3) yours.

Dan Fabulich asserts that from his frame of reference, my copy and I are
indistiguishable.  Thus they are both Scott Badger.  This suggests, of
course, that for Scott Badger to continue, either the original or the copy
could be destroyed and no harm would be done.  Sure . . . from your frame of
reference.

My copy (Scott 2) would believe himself to be the original unless it was
convincingly demonstrated that he was, in fact, the copy.  I (Scott 1) would
also be aware that I am the original.  That, alone, would make us
distinguishable.  When we're all three in the same room and you look at
Scott 1, point to Scott 2, and say, "That's you.", both Scott's will
certainly disagree with you.  And they would be right to do so.

It's easier to accept your assertions if Scott 1 is destroyed and Scott 2 is
not made aware of the fact that he's a copy, *and* if you are not aware that
a copy was ever made.  Now, for all intents and purposes of interaction, he
*is* me.  But . . . who speaks for the dead?  Just because my frame of
reference is unable to be expressed doesn't make it non-existent does it?

Best regards,

Scott 1

Check out the MoQ (Metaphysics of Quality) work of R. M. Pirsig. A web
search on the phrase "subjects, objects, data and values" should turn up
something.

The metric you mention is mentioned, but subordinated.

The Hippocampal Slice Project (HSP) is a joint research effort by The
Institute for Neural Cryobiology (INC) and a research institute
affiliated with a major Southern California university medical center
(RI), which seeks to successfully cryopreserve (most likely by
vitrification) rat hippocampal slices, and after rewarming, have them
exhibit full functionality (including the propagation of evoked nerve
activity along axons from neuron to neuron across the rewarmed brain
slice). The HSP seeks to accomplish this, and to demonstrate its success
by methods which will be applicable to whole brains, with the additional
advances necessary to allow the perfusion of the cryoprotectant
mixtures, and the induction of the cooling/warming rate protocols which
the HSP shows will allow successful reversible cryopreservation. For
more details see: http://neurocryo.org

The project has achieve full committee and contractual approval by both
parties and is currently in the funding, staffing, and equipment
procurement phase. The funding plans call for approximately $75,000 to
be contributed by RI with the option to allocate an additional $25,000
as needed. This money from RI is already available to the project's
Principal Investigator. INC is to contribute approximately $78,000 worth
of equipment for the specialized needs of the project.

Currently, INC has raised a total of $44,000 for this purpose, either in
the bank or on its way. The most advanced and expensive piece of
equipment, a PCI2000 Motionscope image recording system costing
$25,500.00 capable of recording 8,000 frames per second, has now been
ordered and other equipment orders will soon follow (up to the funds we
have available). We are now at the stage where staffing plans cannot be
finalized until we know when we can actually begin the project research.
That, of course, cannot happen until all the equipment is in place, and
in turn, that cannot happen until INC has the money to procure the
equipment.  

Trying to raise the funds for this project has been both disappointing
and at the same time heartening. Is has been disappointing to see so few
pledgers to the Prometheus Project come through with funding for this
project which is a direct result of Prometheus. On the other hand, it
has been heartening to have such large donations from Edgar Swank
($8,000) and Tim Freeman ($6,000), to have several people donate who
were not Prometheus pledgers, John Bull ($1,000) and Kevin Brown ($500),
to have checks arrive unannounced from totally unknown (to me) people,
Claude & Melinda Young ($500), and finally, to have our first donation
for someone outside of the US or Canada, Stephen Whitrow from the UK
($500). I wish also to make special mention of Keith Lynch and Mark
Mugler both of whom sent a *second* $1,000 contribution.

Since I, personally, no longer have the liquid assets to place toward
this project, I have devised a method to use some of the few assets
which I have left after my 6+ years of cryonics activities, which I hope
may be sufficient to attract the remaining funds needed for the HSP.
Here is my proposal.

For each donation of $5,000 or more to INC for the HSP, I will give the
donor an option to purchase shares in 21st Century Medicine from me at
any time after those shares become salable, for $10 per share, up to the
total of the donation amount. At this price, my share holdings in 21CM
are sufficient to cover all the rest of the money which needs to be
raised for the HSP. Since 21CM is planning a share offering within the
next year (possibly before the end of this year) which is virtually
certain to be at a minimum of $10 per share, with minimum size purchase
of at least $10,000, I believe that my offer should be attractive to
those who have always wanted to *invest* in cryonics research rather
than donate. To be fair, I must also extend this offer to Edgar Swank,
Tim Freeman and Roy Yowell, the three people who have already donated
$5,000 or more.

I thank you for your attention and I look forward to your response.

Good point.  Note, however, that the converse is also true; i.e., if gun
ownership really isn't tied to crime rate (either positively or
negatively), then owning a gun "for protection", as many gun owners on this
list claim to do, may not make sense.  If I were living in a neighborhood
where crime was rampant, and for whatever reason couldn't/wouldn't leave,
then owning a gun might very well be reasonable. If I didn't (and I don't),
then my resources are likely better spent elsewhere.

In the same section (I forget which book, though), Dawkins makes the
example that if we had natural lifespans of say, 500 000 years, we would
probably avoid "high-risk" activities such as crossing the street.  I find
this a sobering thought: it would be a sad irony indeed if in gaining
indefinite lifespans we become afraid to live.

If I didn't exist I wouldn't feel like I didn't
exist, I wouldn't feel at all. The point that I'm
making is that there is dedicated logic in my
brain that makes me feel certain things for
certain very good reasons. Some philosophers argue
that there is a "spark" of consciousness that
makes me feel like I exist. But I believe that
there is no consciousness in that sense, instead
the feeling of existence is product of feeling
itself.

Yes and no... if you're poor but live in a good area, then spending money
on a gun may not make sense. But just because carrying guns may not cause
a massive drop in murders (e.g. based on national figures Floridian murder
rates probably dropped about 20% after the concealed carry law was passed,
which is significant but nothing like the 99% drop in moving from DC to
Vermont) the risk to an individual carrying a gun may well drop more. If 
someone decides to rob and kill me and I point a gun at them and they run 
away, they may well just rob and kill some unarmed person instead; so the 
murder rate won't drop, but *my* chances of being murdered in that instance
went down 100%.

Quite possibly; we're not saying that owning a gun will magically make
you invulnerable, nor that everyone needs to. We're saying that even if
gun ownership didn't reduce murder rates to some extent, attempts to ban
them are far, far less useful than other actions.

Certainly if I owned a gun it would be primarily for shooting at targets,
not for shooting at people. But knowing that I could shoot people if I
ever got into a situation where I had to would certainly be a benefit.

Not neccesarily; we might decide to stop crossing streets, but we would
probably work out ways to reduce the risks associated with crossing
streets... e.g. armored bodies, remote drones linked to brains in vats,
etc. We'd want to reduce the risks, but there are numerous ways to do
that.

But since the contribution is there it suggests
that catchall technologies like "artificial
intelligence" will be needed for software
developers to keep the current rate of growth in
software complexity. Where do you think a
breakthrough might come from?

Creating any kind of universal intelligence would
be a massive task, even with genetic algorithms
(which haven't had much success on large projects,
let alone human level intelligence). And if you're
expecting such an SI to "evolve" in the network
you would need to have a very specific environment
to get to display human-like qualities. This is
unlikely to happen without a large co-operative
effort to build the SI, which is unlikely due to
risk factors, etc. Anyone with the kind of money
and resources necessary to pull off such a project
would have no obvious reason to do so.

People will have smaller faster more intelligent
computers.

I think my real objection with the SI scenario is
the idea that people think intelligence must also
mean the ability to wake up one morning and decide
to wreak havoc on the mortals.

Yep, I agree entirely... the best way to ensure that transhuman ideas get
a good image in the media is to get transhumans into the media. I'm now
putting together my second short film (which isn't transhuman as such, but
is anti-gullibility) and starting to think about ideas for a cheap feature 
next year; with good 3D on PCs I can probably do something interesting for
the video market for very little money. This is why I haven't posted much 
for a year or so; film-making takes a hell of a lot of time.

Title
  Oral glucose tolerance test after high-dose i.v. biotin
  administration in normoglucemic hemodialysis patients.
Source
  Renal Failure.  18(1):131-7, 1996 Jan.
Abstract
  Abnormal glucose metabolism in uremia may result from a complex interplay
  between decreased insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Recent studies
  report beneficial effect of biotin administration in glucose
  metabolism in diabetic animals and in a small number of patients with
  diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to
  evaluate the response of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to the i.v.
  administration of large doses of biotin in hemodialysis
  patients. Eleven hemodialysis patients aged 56.90 +/- 11.20 (32-76) years on
  regular hemodialysis thrice a week for 2.72 +/- 1.79 (1-7) years were
  studied. Fasting venous plasma glucose, glucosylated hemoglobin (%GH), and
  plasma glucose concentration 2 h after the administration of a 75-g glucose
  load were measured before, and 2 weeks and 2 months after administration of
  50 mg of biotin i.v. postdialysis, and after a 2-month
  washout period. During the study, dialysis schedule and patients' medication,
  diet, and dry weight were kept unchanged. OGTT was abnormal in 4 patients
  before biotin administration and became normal in 3 patients
  (75%). Our results offer support to the findings of other studies about the
  beneficial effect of biotin in experimental or clinical
  diabetes mellitus, and argue for the involvement of
  biotin in glucose metabolism.

Title
  Reduction of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by CDC-flaxseed with very
  low alpha-linolenic acid.
Source
  Atherosclerosis.  136(2):367-75, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
  Flaxseed (Type I flaxseed) with 51-55% alpha-linolenic acid in its oil and
  richest source of plant lignans, has been shown to reduce
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by 46% without lowering serum lipids.
  Antiatherogenic activity was claimed to be due to its alpha-linolenic acid
  and/or lignan content. If alpha-linolenic acid component of flaxseed is
  responsible for antiatherogenic activity, then, CDC-flaxseed (Type II
  flaxseed) which has similar oil and lignan content but has very little (2-3%
  of the total oil) alpha-linolenic acid would have no antiatherogenic effect.
  An investigation, therefore, was made of Type II flaxseed on high cholesterol
  diet-induced atherosclerosis and serum lipids [total cholesterol (TC),
  triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
  (VLDL-C)] in rabbits. Rabbits were assigned to four groups: Group I, Control;
  Group II, Type II flaxseed diet (7.5 g/kg orally daily); Group III, 1%
  cholesterol diet; Group IV, 1% cholesterol diet supplemented with Type II
  flaxseed (7.5 g/kg orally daily). Blood samples were collected before (0
  time) and after 4 and 8 weeks of experimental diets for measurement of serum
  lipids. Aorta was removed at the end of 8 weeks for assessment of
  atherosclerotic plaques. Serum TC, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C were
  lower in Group IV as compared to Group III by 14 and 31%, 17 and 32%, 28 and
  34% and 24 and 32%, respectively, at 4 and 8 weeks. HDL-C was not affected by
  Type II flaxseed in hypercholesterolemic rabbit. TG and VLDL-C were markedly
  increased in Group IV as compared to Group III. Type II flaxseed reduced the
  development of atherosclerosis by 69%. Histological changes in the
  atherosclerotic regions were qualitatively similar in Groups III and IV.
  Results indicate that reduction in hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by
  Type II flaxseed is due to a decrease in serum TC and LDL-C. In conclusion,
  antiatherogenic activity of Type II flaxseed is not due to alpha-linolenic
  acid.

Title
  Dietary flax seed in prevention of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis.
Source
  Atherosclerosis.  132(1):69-76, 1997 Jul 11.
Abstract
  Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) have been implicated in the development of
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. Flax seed is the richest source of
  omega-3 fatty acid and lignans. omega-3 Fatty acid suppresses the production
  of interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and leukotriene B4
  (LTB4), and of OFRs by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and monocytes.
  Lignans possess anti-platelet activating factor (PAF) activity and are
  antioxidant. PAF, IL-1, TNF and LTB4 are known to stimulate PMNLs to produce
  OFRs. Flaxseed would, therefore, reduce the levels of OFRs and hence would
  prevent the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. The effects
  of dietary flax seed on a high cholesterol diet induced atherosclerosis,
  lipid profile and OFR-producing activity of PMNLs (PMNL-CL) were investigated
  in rabbits. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups: group I, control; group
  II, flax seed diet (7.5 g/kg daily, orally); group III, 1% cholesterol diet;
  and group IV, same as group III but received flax seed (7.5 g/kg daily,
  orally). Blood samples were collected before and after 4 and 8 weeks on their
  respective diets for biochemical measurements and aortae were removed at the
  end of 8 weeks for estimation of atherosclerotic changes. The high
  cholesterol diet increased the serum level of total cholesterol (TC) and
  PMNL-CL without altering the levels of serum triglycerides (TG). These
  changes were associated with a marked development of atherosclerosis in the
  aorta. Flax seed reduced the development of aortic atherosclerosis by 46% and
  reduced the PMNL-CL without significantly lowering the serum cholesterol.
  Flax seed in normocholesterolemic rabbits increased serum total cholesterol
  and decreased PMNL-CL without significantly affecting the serum TG. Modest
  dietary flax seed supplementation is effective in reducing
  hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis markedly without lowering serum
  cholesterol. Its effectiveness against hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis
  could be due to suppression of enhanced production of OFRs by PMNLs in
  hypercholesterolemia. Dietary flax seed supplementation could, therefore,
  prevent hypercholesterolemia-related heart attack and strokes.

Last week, there was a discussion on the zeroth law of robotics. I once
heard of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, but have never seen it listed
anywhere. What is the zeroth law of thermodynamics?

All these variations determine is that size of the hardware supporting each
upload, and the initial size of the upload population.  And maybe (or maybe not)
the speed each runs at.  But the primary Malthusian prediction, of subsistence
wages, remains unchanged.

Depends. It seems like the 'bad neighborhood' syndrome tends to spread like a
cancer, and only some serious work can turn such trends around. You might live
in a nice neighborhood today, but what happens when some pretty bad people move
into your neighborhood either because they got scared of the really bad people
in their old neighborhood, or are looking for virgin territory to fleece? Are
you gonna move someplace else? And someplace else again? and again? and again?
When do you stop running and start shooting back?

Yes, why is Mutual Assured Destruction a fine policy for nation states but not
for individual people? Its worked fine for 50 years around the world, I think
that a personal policy of micro-MAD is a fine survival policy.

I think that the deterrent effect of  micro-MAD on a person for person basis is
fine. I'm not afraid to live, I'm gonna take whatever measures are needed to
live as long and as much as I can. I won't be scared of going certain places
either.

Yes. Since the IRS has not succeeded in upgrading/fixing even a few percent of its
computer system to Y2K compliance, when fiscal year 2000 comes along (on July1
1999) less than a year from now, they will begin to lose track of how much
corporations owe, and when January 1, 2000 comes, they will have no idea how much
any of us actually owes them. As it is, their network is so screwed up that at any
one time there are an average of six completely different tax asessments on each
person on the IRS network.

Only because they make it so. There is no need to worry about many of the things
people claim they ''need", when they are that distressed and are trying to make a
fresh start. People purposely complicate their lives. I've simplified my life in
the past three years so much that I can live on $12,000.00 per year rather
comfortably, and the rest is just gravy. I have lots of fun, do lots of things. I
just avoid complicating things.

Actually, its partly because concealed weapons permits are easier to get than
before (you used  to have be either a mafia don or a politician's family member to
get one) and partly because police and the prosecutors are classifying more deaths
as self defense (as they are finally recognising an individual's right to defend
themselves) so those deaths are not counted as murders.

No, police cheifs attribute the reduction to improved police work (of course, they
need to take the credit), while the prime police cheif lobbying organizations are
anti-gun, while the rank and file police officers and their representatives are
pro-gun, and they will all tell you that the reduction is a result of more armed
and active private citizens.

Criticism by who???  The most hilarious thing about his study was that prior to
the study he was anti-gun, and was hired by Handgun Control, Inc., the #1 anti-gun
group in the US to perform the study. When his conclusions contradicted what HCI
wanted to see, and was convinced they would see, they fired Professor Lott, and
Lott had to publish the book to recoup all of the money he spent on the study that
HCI refused to pay when his conclusions contradicted their agenda. His study is by
light years the most comprehensive study of FBI crime statistics in history, and
by correlating stats with timelines of specific public policies (not just gun
control liberalization laws) in specific jurisdictions where and when they were
enacted; he was able to show a number of other things, like, for example, that the
Death Penalty has little to no effect on crime rates.

If you have a population of people that is directly descended from a feudal
population of serfs and peons, you will of course have a much more cattle-like
acceptance of gun control, and gun control will be irrelevant, since a cattle-like
population will have a much smaller percentage of deviant personalities than one
that is made up of people who were kicked out of that cattle-like population.

Well, I live in the city, and I can't recall hearing any rank and file police
officer saying anything of the sort.  My friend happens to be one in fact,
graduated a few years ago, and he certainly doesn't think so.  Matter of fact,
many seem to think that rates are going down because citizens are AVOIDING
problem areas, not taking care of problem areas with firearms.

The French people have gone through FIVE different governments in the time we
have had ONE government.  That's hardly cattle-like.  Perhaps you should
review the history of Ireland, and see how "cattle-like" they were to British
government rule.  As far as deviant personalities and behavior goes, try
visting the red-light district of Amsterdam.  The overall trust and support of
government actually rates higher in the United States than most other nations
(no I can't recall the names of the polls or studies, so take it with a
grain).  Point here that the thesis you offered is simplistic and doesn't
account for a large amount of evidence that indicates contrary to the thesis.
As far as crime rates go, I am not at all sure about this, but (pay attention
here Mark) I think that some European nations actually have higher rates of
rape and certain violent crimes than does the United States, as well as higher
rates of burglary.


The fact that one's ancestors were oppressed and accustomed to questionless
obediance does not mean that one today will also be accustomed questionless
obediance.  As an explanation of foreign populations' acceptance of gun
control, it simply does not work.

If they intend to rob and kill you, then you should certainly defend
yourself with any means at your disposal.  But assume instead they only
wish to rob you; pointing your gun at them may escalate the situation
rather than resolving it in your favour.  If you misjudge them and/or their
weaponry, you may find yourself killed or badly hurt at the end of the
encounter rather than merely robbed.

Obviously it can be difficult to discern the robber's exact intent. You can
argue that your decision to use/not use your gun will be based on the
unique situation; my point is that it's easy to construct hypothetical
examples both for and against having a gun on hand. Does anyone know of a
study that compares the outcomes of a particular crime type (e.g., mugging)
between cases in which the victims had guns and those in which they did not?

I agree. I'm not necessarily in favour of severe gun controls, just
questioning the utility of owning a gun.

This may be the trend in the U.S., but it doesn't seem to be happening in
Canada. In fact, the inner city area I live in is a lot nicer place today
than it was twenty years ago, and even then it was hardly dangerous. So
from my perspective the trend is hardly inevitable.

When I run out of neighborhoods ;->  If such a trend did develop, I can
imagine situations in which I would buy a gun. I can also imagine
situations in which I would do other extreme things, but I'm not going to
worry too much about them.  It's silly to underestimate risks, yes, but
over-estimating them is also a mistake.

Some societies manage to get along quite well without micro-MAD; perhaps
nation states find it it a good policy because there is no real
meta-authority to keep them in line, analogous to legal systems within
nations.

Interestingly, there is a lot of current work in the related field of
"watermarking." Watermarking is a way to put an indelable, unobtrusive
identification into a digitized movie. It's part of the movie industry's
attempt to defend their intelectual property rights in the DVD era.
Sounds like king Canute to me, but they take it seriously.

I would agree with that, except that 
"feeling" or "consciouness" is still
not explained by this.  I do not know
whether "feeling" is something which
is fundamentally produced by infor-
mation processing, but I suspect we
will soon find out. :)

It seems to me that Bob, here, has conceded the argument,
so far, by using "they" instead of "it".  He realizes that
there really are two separate atoms, not just one in two
places.  They are certainly interchangable, but not
only one atom, in reality.

Atoms cannot be wet, either, or soft, or...but you
see the point.

*Half* of the music being played does indeed

I would say that we are a process running on

I don't know whether information processing

What do you mean by "simple"?  It may be simple
for whatever mechanism produces it.  It is pretty
simple for water to be wet; it's just an emergent
property of those atoms and bonds.  *Simulating*
wetness is considerably more difficult, and it 
could be argued that you can't simulate wetness
without simulating water as well.  To bring this
back to consciousness, it may be that we can only
produce consciousness by simulating whatever it is
that produces consciousness in the brain, if that
something is not really information processing.

Maybe not the best we will ever have.  I think that
we may be able to decipher exactly how consciousness
is produced.

Once we learn how to record and playback memory
studies of consciousness will have an experimental
basis, no?

Playing back selected memories would be
a better approach, I'd imagine.  Since I
can select a certain memory to think about,
a hypothetical machine that understands 
how the brain works would be able to do it
as well.

If *I* act like you, am I you?
Suppose that I've apent the last
20 years studying you in every
waking moment.  I should then be
able to act like you in every 
conceivable circumstance, yet I
am *still* not you. :)

Does this mean that you feel that society will be structured
substantially as it is today? Do you see any computer-related
differences in the society of today versus the society of
1978? Please take these as true, friendly questions. I'm
interested in you answers. I'm not trying to make rhetorical points.

Actually, the consensus position of the radical singulatarian
community (consisting of me and perhaps 'gene ;-) ) is that the
motivations and actions of the SI are intrinsically unpredictable.
There is no reason to predict that the SI will be inimical, benevolent
or indifferent to humans. I'm personally hoping for benevolence, and
I think the potential benefit is worth the risk.

I haven't a clue. What does Moravic say, and should we believe him? Are

Nope, I made it up as I went along, mentally designing the system on the
fly and probably messing it up severely. I now strongly suspect that between
the two of us we are thinking about three different things: depth with O(log N)
complexity, number of gates needed with O(N), and energy dissipation, which will
depend strongly implementation, with 0(N) required for a minimized depth (i.e.,
depth of 2, fastest algorithm) and O(log N) required for a slow but energy-efficient
approach with one address bit per clock.

Here are are again shifting back and forth between ECC for storage and ECC for
computation. I was addressing storage, wherein we are not using reversable
logic. For storage, as I recall the Hamming distance goes up rapidly with a modest
increase in ECC bits. In conjunction with cashing, the bulk memory words
subject to ECC will be long. The nuber of ECC bits goes up O(log N) with
word length and linearly (?) with the number of errored bits that can be corrected.

You are now discussing error correction during logic operations rather than
storage, and you are correct as far as I know. Brute-force correction for
logic has been done by "voting", where three identical circuits are implemented
together with comparison logic. If the comparison logic is about the same complexity
as the original circuit, the entire ECC scheme is four times as complex and this
ony defends against a one-bit error (sort of.) A five-way vote defends against
2 errors by roughly doubling the complexity again.

There was at east one paper delivered at the 1997 foresight conference:
      http://WWW.FORESIGHT.ORG/Conferences/MNT05/Abstracts/Frakabst.html
That deals with reversible computation.

About five years ago, when encryption was the buzz, a number of digital
studios started doing this type of image hiding, and especially the use of
near-replications of well-known fine art images. The art and science of
communicating in a way which hides the existence of the communication is
used in a lot of modes. Videomakers uses encryption similar to
watermarking, but I guess it was called toastermarking scrumbling.

Re digital images, I'd like to see 2-way interactives that invite third
party encryption images and send then send them back -  encrypt and decrypt
back.

Yes, and it's entirely possible that I'm the only conscious being in the

Exactly. If evolution is correct and if other people really are conscious 
then sentience must by a side effect of intelligence. You could perhaps argue 
that there are other longer routes and that consciousness is just a short cut 
to intelligence and that's why evolution picked it, but that would mean it 
would be harder for us to make an unconscious intelligent robot than a
conscious one.

Yes you can make a case for it, and I even think it's true, I just can't 
prove  it, I can't show that an even stronger case for something other than  
consciousness won't be found that explains behavior even better.

What does cat mean? What does cap mean? what does ca~ mean? What does ca&  
mean? If there are an infinite number of letters you can't define them all.                      

I'm having difficulty understanding your position, first you propose a rule 
of thumb that I think is both practical and reasonable:


        >If mental content provides the best explanation for the object's         
        >behavior, however, then I agree that we should  consider it as having

Agreed. I experience my own mental content directly but behavior is the only 
way to deduce it in others. The trouble I'm having is that later you say:
               

        >I don't think that we can deduce meaning from behavior, 


If so then we can't deduce meaning from anything and we should stop using the 
word in relation to anyone or anything except ourselves.

doh...go on vacation for a week and miss a good dust-up over

don't all think the universe is 4000 years old...

You've missed the point....you don't need no description.  Them cubes will

Allright.  I keep seeing these reference to Florida.  I live in Florida,
and I don't see gun violence decreasing.  I fully believe that murders
may have gone down, but gun violence seems to be way up since they
allowed concealed weapons permits.  Anybody got real statistics about
Florida?

I was born here and have lived here most of my life.  When I was
younger, I don't remember all the violence we have now.  Every day there
is some sort of armed robbery or shooting reported in the local paper.
Often there are three or four shootings.  Every few weeks a child is
shot accidentally.  I would say a child is shot to death every month.
We have has quite a few child shooting deaths since January.  Armed
robbery is way up.  Local convenience stores no longer allow clerks to
work night shifts alone.  Foreign countries warn their travellers about
Florida's gun laws, and our chambers of commerce are trying to combat
our negative gun image.  Alos, every few months some old retiree
baracades themselves in their house and starts shooting at passers-by.
This has already happened maybe four or five times this year.  It seems
that in the retirement capital of the U.S., people are retiring with
their guns.  Many of them start to go senile, and then they use their
guns.  This is not a rare occurance.  I also have seen a mass shooting
almost every year since the concealed permits are allowed.  Before that,
I don't ever recall someone going into a McDonald's and starting
shooting at strangers.  Now we have it all the time, in Post Offices, in
Malls, and lately in schools.  You've heard the recent problems with
kids and guns.  Our local schools say that they confiscate guns every
day from kids who bring them to class.  Hospital emergency rooms handle
shootings every night.  So-called "road-rage" is up, where people get
mad about traffic problems and shoot other drivers.  There are lots of
new phenomenon concerning guns that have just become common since the
new gun laws.

Sorry to ramble.  It may be that the "murder" rate is down, but
shootings have definitely gone up.  I live here, and that's my
perspective.  I would love to see real statistics about guns in Florida.
All the statistics I have seen posted here involved "murders" or
"deaths".  I am more interested in how much crime or violence has
increased or decreased.  Most shootings are not "murders" or even
"attempted murders."

Title
  A tumor preventive effect
  of dietary restriction is antagonized by a high housing temperature through
  deprivation of torpor.
Source
  Mechanisms of Ageing & Development.  92(1):67-82, 1996 Nov 29.
Abstract
  Energy restriction (ER) has proven to be the only effective
  means of retarding aging in mice. The mechanisms of multiplicity of
  effects of ER on aging remain, however, fragmentary. ER
  induces daily torpor, the induction of which is reduced by increasing the
  ambient temperature to 30 degrees C. The effects of
  preventing hypothermia in ER animals were studied in terms of the expected
  consequences of ER on survival, disease pattern and a number of physiological
  parameters in autoimmune prone MRL/lpr mice and lymphoma prone C57BL, 6 mice.
  The results demonstrate that torpor plays a crucial role in the prevention of
  lymphoma development but does not have an affect on other aspects of ER, such
  as prevention of autoimmune diseases.

 Additional data added here by the poster:

   Mortality data for the autoimmune MRL strain and the lymphoma prone
 C57BL strain of mice are as follows: (data derived from table 1)

                     Survival (days)     Percentage alive
                     75%   50%   25%       at 1300 days
 ________________________________________________________
 MRL     Control    167   205   255            0%
         Cntl/30C   170   213   230            0
         CR         217   269   519            8
         CR/30C     201   284   340            0

 C57BL   Control    559   778   880            0
         CR         941  1143  1264           19
         CR/30C     739   810  1049            0

   Storage temperature had no effect on early autoimmune related MRL
 mortality, which was mostly cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage
 and rupture of aortic aneurysms. However later mortality was reduced in
 calorie restricted MRL mice stored at room temperature as opposed to
 those stored at 30C. Presumably this is due to the anticancer effect of
 CR induced hyperthermia, which is antagonized by elevated storage
 temperatures.
   Storage at 30C largely reversed the early antilymphoma effect of CR in
 C57BL mice, reducing the 47% increase in the 50% survival found in CR
 mice to just 4% for the CR/30C group.
   The survival for control C57BL mice varies dramatically from experiment
 to experiment. In one control group from (Experimental Gerontology 15:
 237-258 1980) the 50% survival was about 960 days, which is roughly
 midway between the CR and CR/30C groups in the present experiment.
 Variations in temperature regulation of the laboratory may account for
 some of these differences.

  Biotin in high doses was given for 1-2 years to three

  Within 4-8 weeks there was a marked improvement in clinical and laboratory

  deficiency, inactivity or unavailability of Biotin,
  resulting in disordered activity of biotin-dependent enzyme,
  pyruvate carboxylase, leading to accumulation of pyruvate and/or depletion of
  aspartate, both of which play a significant role in nervous system
  metabolism. Based on our good results, regular biotin
  administration could be suggested for every diabetic patient for the
  prevention and management of peripheral neuropathy although extensive
  randomised clinical trials are required.

If you trust the Florida state government:

    http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/

Basic answer: number of crimes has gone up in many categories, but the per-capita rate has generally gone down. It's hard to compare current
figures to those before the concealed carry law because the government
changed the way they collect statistics around that time (presumably
this is why they don't list anything for 1988), but whatever the case
it has not gone up as the anti-gunners predicted.

>I was born here and have lived here most of my life.  When I was
>younger, I don't remember all the violence we have now. 

When you were younger the population was probably a lot lower. Florida
may be more violent than it was a decade ago, but the risk to an 
individual is significantly lower. And if you look back to the seventies 
even the per-capita crime rates were much lower... when there were probably 
far fewer restrictions on gun ownership.

>Every day there
>is some sort of armed robbery or shooting reported in the local paper.

Yes, but looking at the number of crimes comitted is more useful than
looking at the number reported in the newspaper; who's to say that 
they haven't started reporting more crimes than they used to?

>Foreign countries warn their travellers about
>Florida's gun laws, 

And probably encourage travellers to go to nice safe LA where they're
ten times as likely to be killed, but there are stricter gun laws. Just
because foreign governments are anti-gun does not say much about
Florida.

> Before that,
>I don't ever recall someone going into a McDonald's and starting
>shooting at strangers.  

Before that it was quite rare on a national level; today, after the
sensationalist publicity given to earlier shootings around the world
it's far more common everywhere. Even in those countries such as Britain
which have anti-gun laws which would make New York's look lenient.

"Road rage" murders, with or without guns, are also more common in 
Britain than they were before the new Floridian gun laws (when they 
were almost non-existent). Did those laws cause the murders in Britain 
too?

>Sorry to ramble.  It may be that the "murder" rate is down, but

That's probably true; but the population has increased dramatically so
while the number of shootings may have increased (I can't read the Web
while sending mail to check the figures) the per-capita rates have gone 
down.

I never quite got this "budget surplus" thing; people keep saying that
the budget is balanced or even has a surplus, yet the national debt 
on 7/7/98[1] was:

    $5,530,116,137,980.45

And a year earlier was:

    $5,355,915,100,573.58

So in a year the national debt has increased by about $175,000,000,000 
yet there's a balanced budget? Maybe this government math is just too 
hard for me, but I don't think my bank would be too happy if I were to 
claim that I'd earnt as much as I'd spent, yet go $175 billion further 
into debt.

For the national debt not to increase by the end of the fiscal year,
the government have to find at least $120,000,000,000 from somewhere;
in the same period last year they overspent by around $60,000,000,000.

Where's the surplus?

Basically, there is a surplus if the funds brought in exceed the funds
expended, and there is a deficit if the funds brought in are less than the
funds expended.  The debt is the sum total of all surpluses minus all
deficits.

So of course one can have surpluses when one has debt.

So, given that the debt is $175 billion larger, there's a $175 billion 
deficit, right?

Uh-huh, true but utterly irrelevant. You can have a surplus and have

Ah, so interest doesn't count as spending because it's not being paid off? 
The US economy is doing great because the government has reached the point 
where it's only running up $175,000,000,000 in unpaid interest every year? 
Wow, I must run out and celebrate; let's party in the streets!

Somehow I don't think I'd be doing too well if I was accumulating unpaid
interest every year equal to more than a tenth of my income.

As I've written before in connection with discussions of "tort reform", mass
media accounts of any emotionally charged subject are a poor source of
authority upon which to form an opinion.  In the tort reform debate, the
operation of what I call the "sensation filter" is obvious to anyone who
actually works with the subject matter on a day-to-day basis.  Lawsuits that
DON'T result in large verdicts simply aren't reported, because they aren't
sensational.  Therefore, counting news reports of large verdicts is a
completely meaningless exercise, if one is trying to really guage the impact
of the tort system on various social issues.  Likewise, an account of a person
who owns and may carry a gun, but who never uses it, or simply deters a crime
by brandishing the weapon isn't "newsworthy".  One rarely sees a news account
of a dog that DOESN'T bite a person.  Accordingly one can draw few meaningful
conclusions about the safety of dog-ownership from news stories about dog
bites.

The rigorous collection and analysis of statistical information about social
phenomena is itself a relatively boring enterprise.  Newspapers and television
channels make money by reporting interesting things.  See, for instance, the
recent flap about CNN's apparently erroneous report about the use of nerve gas
on defectors in Laos durng the US war there.  Unfortunately, mass media
stories have a very great impact on the formation of public and private
opinion on important social issues.  Sober analysis of rigorously collected
statistics takes a back seat to sensation.

The reason the total federal debt increased in a surplus year is due to the mathematical chimera of government accounting! :)

The U.S. government decided that it should include in its receipts figures a portion of the receipts from payroll taxes (specifically, from Social Security taxes). The government takes these receipts and uses them to fund government operations. 

"Blasphemy" you decry? "Wasn't that money specifically taxed for the purpose of placing in the Social Security Trust Fund for the retirments of the baby boomers?" Yes, it was. The government currently takes in around $200 billion more a year in FICA taxes than it spends on social security. The whole point of this was to build a reserve fund for when the 60+ million baby boomers, who haven't saved nearly enough, began to retire.

So how does the government account for this shady practice? Instead of placing actual money in the coffers of the Social Security Trust Fund it places federal IOUs, thats right... federal debt instruments. In reality, any budget surplus/deficit figure the government releases should be adjusted downward by around $200 billion. If the government says the budget surplus is $20 billion, its really a $180 billion deficit.

Another nice twist, if a U.S. corporation took the overfunding amounts of its pension plans and include those amounts in revenue, thereby boosting its reported results, the SEC would be all over them. Ah, the priviledge of being a sovereign government.

The fact is that this is happening all over. This is directly correlated
to 
the increase in young people, particularily young males. 

It's like Wm. Burrough's Economics of a Junkie (junkies know what they
each would prefer to take, but in need they will use anything). In a
similar vein, the violence-prone also know what they would prefer to
use, but when the mood hits, they'll use whatever they can get their
hands on.

In a macro-societal sense, the problem will pass as the violence-prone
are put down, locked up, or just grow older. As the Danish poet Piet
Hein explained in his poem TTT, ting tager tid (ie, things take time).

In a micro-societal sense, I am at a loss to understand why restrictions
should exist on the ability of of folks to protect themselves as best
possible. But then I guess I'm another extropian(-wannabe) with those
nasty libertarian tendencies...

Agency to oversee genetic engineering proposed 

Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 Reuters News Service 

BOSTON (July 8, 1998 8:39 p.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - An ethicist
has
called for a U.S. government agency to oversee human experimentation involving
genetic engineering as the debate over human cloning raged in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine. 

Boston University's George Annas, a physician, argued in an opinion column
that
human experiments involving clones, embryos, genetic engineering and organ
transplants from animals should not be allowed without such an agency's
approval. 

"Any such national regulatory agency must be composed almost exclusively of
nonresearchers and nonphysicians so it can reflect public values," Annas
said. 
The agency must be convinced that the research does not threaten
individuals or
"call deeply held social values into question. This shift in the burden of
proof is critical if society is to have an influence over science," Annas
said.


But University of Texas School of Law Professor John Robertson countered that
cloning may offer important options to infertile couples or obtaining
tissue or
organs for transplants. 

Robertson wrote that the permanent ban on all cloning being considered by
Congress "is also unjustified." 

"Rather than seek to prohibit all uses of human cloning, we should focus our
attention on ensuring that cloning is done well," Robertson said. 

The debate over cloning continues around the world. 

A measure to prohibit human cloning was making its way through the Israel's
Knesset (Parliament). 

And in Japan, scientists at the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center
reported they succeeded in producing two calves which are exactly similar to
adult cows. 
The cow that gave birth Sunday to the cloned twin calves died several days
later. 

The twin calves were born exactly two years after Dolly, the British sheep
that
made history by becoming the first clone of an adult animal. 

Last month, the company that helped bring Dolly into the world was granted the
license for use of the cloning technology pioneered by Edinburgh's Roslin
Institute. 

PPL Therapeutics, in conjunction with the Roslin Institute, produced Dolly and
Polly, the first cloned transgenic sheep.

The level of violence in Ireland since the time of troubles has always been lower
than the US average rate, and we had no real war going on here.

"Harmless" social behavior has been tolerated, while 'anti-social', 'sociopathic'
behavior, like defending oneself, and insisting on posessing the means to do so,
are heavily frowned upon.

If you are counting stats as of RIGHT NOW, then it obvious that our currently top

This is obvious, if true. Since nobody can protect themselves with firearms, it
logically follows that they will be more likely to fall prey to criminals of this
sort with no recourse for self defense. However, US statistics only account for
crimes where someone was victimized. They do not account for the 2.5 million
incidents of law abiding citizens successfully defending themselves each year. If
those people were not armed, they would also be victims, contributing to crime
rate even higher than it currently is, and their lack of means of defense would
allow criminals to get away, encouraged to continue criminal behavior.

I dunno, Japan and China are fine, fine examples.

I didn't say it was. It just takes a lot of work to fix once it happens. I would
also say that Canada, up until the last 10 years has been much more culturally
homogenous than the US.

Refusing to prepare for either is the biggest mistake you can make, because you
can never estimate anything with much precision. A number of wize old people have
said on various occasions, when asked how they lived so long, and were so
successful, "If you prepare for the worst, and prepare for the best, anything that
happens you will be prepared to handle with ease."

Some societies get along fine without a built in, implied micro-MAD policy in
their culture/government, but only in the short term. Such societies always tend
to either self-destabilize due to a lack of internal checks and balances, or are
interfered with by an outside party. You can praise the fine, pro-gun-control
societies in Europe all you want, and they may be quaint places to visit, but they
always seem to need rescuing every few decades when their quaint ideas delaminate
from reality. I think that the only thing that has kept Europe from degrading into
a continent wide version of yugoslavia is the implied threat that US forces
represent.

Even the most civil society must have an implied threat of force on the part of
the individual members of that society to hold it together, and to protect it from
threats from higher authorities or from outside forces. If you beleive that all
power originates in the individual, then the individual must be prepared and
willing to take responsibility for the management of that power, no matter how
much he or she has delegated it. They must also personally take responsibility for
defending the power which they have not delegated to their governments. Anything
less is head-in-the-sand abdication of the individual as the source of power.

Clearly there are two atoms, they have twice the mass of one atom for one 
thing, but they're interchangeable in ALL circumstances, that is, if they are 
exchanged nothing happens. To repeat, when atoms are exchange no phenomena 
changes in any way, including the phenomena of consciousness, good thing too
because from birth the atoms in our body are in a constant state of flux yet 
we remain the same person... I think.

Yes I believe I do, atoms have no individuality but by arranging them into  
large complex patterns you can make an object that does behave in a unique 
way, and of course a pattern is defined by information. Atoms are generic but 
there is only one place where they are put together in such a way that they 
behave in a John Clarkish way, at least only  one place so far.

And if I erase an Email message on my computer that you sent me but you

But lots of objects would do just as well but if we change the process we 
change who we are. You're not really trying to argue that the reason I'm  me 
and you're you is that there's something special about our particular atoms 
are you?

Simple means easy for intelligence to understand. I'm too simple to understand  
what else it could mean.
            

        >It may be simple for whatever mechanism produces it.  

Now who's attributing meaning to inanimate processes?

That phrase, "emergent property" has never been one of my favorites, it's a 
vague catch all idea that, near as I can tell, just means complex stuff 
happening without the help of intelligence. We need to understand how it 
works  or we might as well call it "magic property".


     >*Simulating* wetness is considerably more difficult, and it could be      
     >argued that you can't simulate wetness without simulating water as well. 
            

True, especially if you insist on going from first principles. Nobody has 
ever calculated the freezing point of water starting from the equations of 
Quantum Mechanics. It's can be done in principle but it's too complex in 
practice, maybe in 20 years, less if somebody makes a Quantum Computer.

        >if that something is not really information processing.


If it's not information processing then it's the soul and it's far too early 
in the game to give up and abandon reason, especially when things are 
progressing so well.
            
        >I think that we may be able to decipher exactly how consciousness

But how could you ever know if your deciphering is correct?
            

        >Once we learn how to record and playback memory studies of

No, it could be the experimental basis for the study of intelligence but not 
for consciousness. You could examine the position and velocity of every atom 
in my brain and know better than I do myself what I'm going to do next, but  
the only way you could know for certain what my subjective experience is 
would be for you to put you're brain into the exact same state as my brain is 
in. The trouble is even that wouldn't work and "you" still wouldn't know 
because you wouldn't be you anymore, you'd be me, and that would be a  
pointless experiment because I already know what it's like to be me.
            
        >Playing back selected memories would be a better approach, I'd         
        >imagine.  

You might be able to make a machine that would let you know what it's like to 
be you pretending to be me, but all the memories in the world won't let you 
know what it's like for me being me.
            

        >Since I can select a certain memory to think about, a hypothetical         
        >machine that understands how the brain works would be able to do it        
        >as well.
            
But that's exactly the problem, there is absolutely no way to know for 
certain if your hypothetical machine really does understand how consciousness 
works.      

        >If *I* act like you, am I you?

I've hear something like that suggested as a method for uploading, you carry 
around a passive device that would observe you and try to predict your next 
move, when it made a mistake it would change it's programming and try again, 
gradually it would get better and better until it was you. Philosophically 
this would work but I'm not sure it's practical or how long it would take.

        >yet I am *still* not you. :)

Why not? You're certainly not you anymore so you must be me.

Computers have made major contributions to trends
in wealth, employment, and education but there are
still no radical differences in society.

I think the basic structure of society is likely
to persist for the next 20-years. People may live
longer, consume more information, etc, but that is
not a radical change and certainly not an
entirely unpredictable one.

I would say there is a greater chance of
benevolent or "useless" SI than a hostile or
useful SI. You're talking about emergent behaviour
from a fundamentally different environment to our
own. It's not only unlikely that the result, if
any, would be considered "intelligent" but it's
even less likely it would be prone to the human
whims of violence and purposeful destruction.

I think some people make the mistake of thinking
that because we are likely to create software with
human-understanding capabilities, this software
can create an emergent SI capable of taunting it's
victims before killing them. Putting all the
pieces of an SI together in such away for it to be
hostile would be an unimaginable act of
negligence. Doing it on purpose would require
unparalleled co-operation and resources.

Of course, you can always argue you have time (if
it doesn't happen in 10 years, what about 100, or
1,000?) This is true, the more time goes by the
more likely it is to happen by accident or on
purpose. It's also more likely that we will have a
greater understanding of dynamic systems and would
be able to engineer the overall behaviour to our
advantage. And if you're using SI's for any
practical purpose (evolutionary theory, cognitive
science, doing homework) it's still relatively
easy to stop it from doing any harm.

This does not mean there will be *no* emergent
behaviour, it's just unlikely anyone will call
this intelligence (unless our definition of that
word has dramatically changed). And it's even less
likely it will be hostile (although unforeseen
emergent properties will no doubt cause accidents,
and the papers will run their usual scare
stories).

Sorry guys, but this is ridiculous.

I said that Florida is not the crime-free paradise that I keep seeing
quoted.  Gun violence reports are up.  The explanation I got back was:
> who's to say that they haven't started reporting more crimes than
> they used to?

Well, great.  Lets look at total crime, it is up.  The explanation:
> number of crimes has gone up in many categories, but the per-capita rate
> has generally gone down.

But wait, state statistics for Florida show per-capita crime is UP.
The explanation:
> It's hard to compare current figures to those before the concealed carry
> law because the government changed the way they collect statistics around
> that time

Come on guys.  Is everybody in on this liberal conspiracy to make guns
look bad?  If the newspapers, TV news, police reports and state
statistics are all unreliable, then where do you get the idea that guns
have reduced crime in Florida?  I'm not saying it can't happen, but you
sure aren't giving any evidence for your claims.

I didn't want to get into the gun debate, but here goes...

I don't want to say guns are bad, or argue about guns per se.  I agree
that it is extropian to be self-reliant and to protect oneself.  And I
certainly can see why many people would turn to guns for that purpose.
In that case, guns *might* be a useful tool.  But hammers, pencils, and
shoes are also useful...  But are they extropian?

When I think of extropianism, transhumanism, or futurism, I think of
science and technology.  I want to gain life-extension through advanced
biochemistry.  I want to gain exploration through spaceships.  I want to
gain processing power through nanocomputers.

I don't think of gunpowder, explosives, and projectiles.  I don't think
of killing people.  As I plan my extended life, I like to list all the
things that I want to make occur in the future.  Blowing someone's
brains out is not one of them.  I have no desire to pack a weapon and
kill people who get in my way.  If my plans would run into the point
that I think I will have to become a killer, I think I would try to
reshape my plans.  If my plans get to the point, that I think that there
is no way to avoid an unpleasant situation and that I am stuck with the
situation that the universe has handed me, I think I would try to change
the universe.

When somebody comes into my office and lab to see the neat stuff that I
want to demonstrate for the future.  I want to show them my computers
and state that those who can keep up with the technology will rule the
future.  I don't want to unlock my gun cabinet and explain that those
who are better armed will rule the future.

I am so sick of hearing Heinlein's quote that "an armed society is a
polite society."  Frankly, I don't want to live in a society where I am
afraid to call someone an asshole because they might blow me away.  If
politeness is based on fear of retribution, that's coersion.  If I am
that afraid to be rude to someone, why would I be any less afraid to
speak out against someone, or to scientifically refute someone's ideas
when they are wrong.  I want future conversations based on rational
debate, and not on retaliatory advantage.  If I wanted that, I would
just start e-mail-bombing anyone here who disagreed with me.  In a war
of network security, I think I would win.  But that's not what I want.
If I use a weapon to make someone act polite toward me, no respect has
been gained.

	First off, I wanted to say I'm completely new to this mailing list, and
also new to finding people outside of my small realm of 2-3 people for
discussing these topics.  So if I fail any etiquettes that are required for
discussions here, please let me know immediately, Thanks..

	Now that that is out of the question : ->

	Does anybody here believe there will be a Star Trek future where all we
will have to do is spend time improving ourselves through whatever means
necessary?  ie: The idealistic society where all of our food needs,
clothing needs, etc etc are taken care of by educated/intelligent machines
& computers?.  If a society like this IS to exist, it certainly won't be
any time soon, but....

	Is there any facets of these technologies that we can develop in the next
10 or 20 years?.  I'd like to wake up in the morning and have some
intelligent computer synthesize food or clothes..  or atleast do something
to produce the equivalent (ie : have it go out and work or do something
equivalent for money, that once the machine is created, NO intervention is
required).  This obviously requires generic synthesis of parts, or
self-replication / repair technology.

	I would like to see the possibilities of life that can be achieved if we
did not have to structure our entire life around working until we are
physically less capable (age 65), and when our body has already undergone
several weakenings of lifetime aging.  There are many things I'd like to
accomplish or even just "play with", that are not possible unless I either
possess a "large sum of money", or "unlimited free time".  I theorize we as
humans advance a lot because we have a lot of people doing specific things
due to unique circumstances causing their upbringing/background and their
future life-line-to-be..   but there are so many things that we could
possibly accomplish if we did not have the burden of an economy to worry
about when trying to do/learn new things...

	I don't really believe there will be a star trek like future, atleast not
any time soon, because there are too many people who are content with just
working the rest of their lives, and never really accomplishing anything,
and then there are those who are content with "controlling" people for the
rest of their lives, and not really doing too much to improve themselves.
Let's say there are two classes of people in a given society : "The Worker
Drones", and the "Motivated People"..  By these classes I suggest the
'Worker Drones' are people who through whatever reasons in their beginnings
of their life, are stuck on the "here and now", stuck on the "short term
gains" of establishing a house, family, retirement, etc..  and establishing
constant income, working their entire lives, etc etc.  Living by all of
societies rules.  Then the "Motivated People" would be the few people who
see beyond everything.  They might be like you and me - people who realize
to accomplish OUR goals, we DO have to play by society's rules and we have
to do certain things in a certain fashion (which is futile - the doctrine
that you are not allowed to make certain decisions until certain points in
life is a horrible thing...), BUT we realize that there IS more to life
than just passing the time.  We'd like to be able to escape our
limitations.  We'd like to be free in some way, or we'd like to improve
everyone as a whole in some way that is not judgemental.  

	This is a hard discussion for me to start - because I had the beginnings
of this discussion about 2 months ago around 2 o'clock in the morning, and
I've lost a lot of specific details of the conversation..   but the concept
is there...

	Anyway, the "worker drones" are prepared to live whatever the "Standard"
or "Standard plus" lifestyle is (standard being what is "normal income or
lower income", and "standard plus" being someone who is well off through
whatever means and in whatever ways)...  the "Motivated people" are the
ones who really shape our society through new concepts, ideas, thoughts,
technologies, and occurances of any kind...    

	I wanted to also theorize here that with each advance the motivated people
create or establish, there is always an equivalent, but slightly different
advance that the worker drone receives.  ie: the industrial revolution -
the motivated people created machines..  eventually we had a working class
society that regardless of what effect the working conditions had on them,
they now had more things to do or use or have in their lifetime.  They
eventually took it for granted that they could have things like cars, home
appliances, etc etc..  instead of having just hand-fabricated everything.
Machine made clothes (ala more than a few nice pairs of clothes now!, wow
:-) ), etc etc...    Another advance example would be computers.  The
motivated people created computers to solve whatever problems or create
whatever possibilities.  The net effect, so far, for the worker drone has
been games & entertainment.  More options for how to make money / live a
life, etc etc..  but the idea of the worker drone is still the same -
sustain themselves on society's "minimum standards", like "Everyone else"..
 and the motivated people are still striving to improve life and society
through whatever means...

	The question I have is - what advances can we make to change humanity "for
the better", and is there any way of upgrading the worker drone into a
self-thinker and motivated spirit?.  I have many examples of friends,
associates, and coworkers, who, even though they are intelligent, learn
well, do well, etc etc..  they're just content on having the "normal things
in life".  When I discuss or bring up certain advanced topics, they think
"that's really cool",, but they do not attempt to analyze whatever
structure might be necessary to create or engage this "coolness"...

	blah blah blah..

	Anything that serves us as a tool I would assume, would be extropian...
Weapons can be used for useful purposes...   This depends on whether or not
you believe the ends justify the means --> I judge someone not on WHAT they
did, but WHY they did it..   If you killed somebody..  that's fine..  as
long as there is a really GOOD reason behind it, and it better benefits
everyone overall.. :-)

	There are definitely "commonly accepted morals" involved here - I mean, to
kill someone is to infringe on someone's right to live their life as they
see it...  for that fact alone, it shouldn't be done..   but if someone's
life were to possibly cease all of humanity, then maybe you might be more
open to killing them yourself?  (aka hitler, stalin)

	I think people are generally good, and technology WILL rule the future
over direct weapons..  but let us not forget technologically advanced
weapons.. :-(  they require technologically advanced countermeasures.  The
problem is, some people are more self-centered than others..  and to make
matters worse, there are people who truly cannot understand and comprehend
reality...  people with 'mental problems' for whatever chemical/emotional
reasons..  we cannot just ignore or banish these type of people, even the
"good people" need to concentrate on weapons and weapons-countermeasures to
keep ahead of the people who truly are out to just harm....

	This all has to do with maturity.

	If someone points a gun at your head?  What do you respect - the person
holding the gun, or the gun itself?.

	Most likely the gun itself :-)..  so you're right, no respect has been
gained...

This illustrates an all too common phenenomenon.

I'm fully convinced that the news media no longer reports the news.  If it
ever did.  What the news media does is attempt to influence public opinion.
And since new news media is rabidly anti gun it's not difficult to imagine
what they will report or how they will report it.

I think they'd probably blatantly lie to advance their cause.  Make up news
stories to support it. . Reference the CNN nerve gas stories.  And for a
historical perspective to illustrate how long this has been going on how about
Hearst and the Spanish American War?

I know that they will mischarterisze in a heartbeat...a personal example is
that I was in that little town in Arkansaw...(hillsboro?) just prior to the
first of the nationallly acclaimed "kids shooting kids"....

It looks nothing like the news media makes it out to be..  Just a medium size
town is all.

Yeah...reality sucks.

The fact of the matter to the best of my understanding is that you either have
to be well enough armed yourself to deter agression  ....or pay someone to do
that little chore for you.  Other wise the social predators run amok amongst
us.

And I agree with what you said. (including that which I didn't copy)...but I
don't see any solution with present day implemented technology.  Particulary
when govenment is falling down on its job...and the social mores that
prevailed in the fifties (check out the violence stats for that time frame...)
have changed so much.

AND I don't see any easy way to return to those days.  A society is an
ecology.  There are certain "progenitor species" that prepare it and then go
away.  The progenitors that prepaired society for its instantiation of the
fifties era are no where to be seen...and similar ones are
(hopefully....<great depression...infant mortality....other great
hardships>....not on the horizon)...

So what to do?  My guess is that it's up to you.

Scientists, Technicians and Engineers I mean.

>From the dawn of life it's always been an "arms race"...arms against armor.
So how about if you techie types come up with better armor and some kind of
non lethal offensive armament that could be as useful as firearms?  Because
it's always GONNA be an arms race...all the wishfulness and happy thinking
isn't gonna change things.

My guess would be (given what little I know of present day tech) that a
portable laser might be used to ionize a pathway thru the air such that it
might conduct an electric current.  Kind of a "cow prod at a distance"...or a
taser without the wires.

A nonlethal device that no one would be seriously hurt with.  (absent the odd
heart attack...but surely less lethal than airborne lead poisoning)...but ever
bit as much a deterrant as a firearm.  BETTER than a fire arm perhaps due to
it's possible physical characterstics of no recoil...speed of light execution
(well...REAL fast anyway...faster than a bullet)...no "lead" nesecarry...low
(or no) noise...etc....etc.. Very little training would be needed.

Or some other kind of a "stunner".

Absent something similar I see no change is our current situation...until all
the boys grow up that is....the ones who survive.

I asked Woodring E. Wright, M.D., Ph.D., who with Dr Shay did the key
telomerase breakthrough work announced back in January in SCIENCE, how
matters were progressing.  I had not been able to find any indication since
about March 1998 of the on-going survival or otherwise of the fibroblasts
treated with telomerase.  The March mention on Geron's site was that they
had exceeded their Hayflick limit by some 20 replications. Dr Wright now
reports:

< All of the cultures continue to divide well. For the BJ fibroblasts,
most of the controls senesced at about PD 65, whereas the hTERT clones
are now mostly between 180 and 200 PD. Thus, one could say they have now
doubled-tripled their lifespan. >

This is wonderful and hopeful news.

1) get access to a color ink-jet printer
2) purchase some EPSON iron-on transper paper
3) purchase 2 plain white cotton or cotton-polyester T-shirts
4) download some extropian art
5) follow the instructions in the pack of transfer paper to make
   two extropian T-shirts.
6) wear one. Send the other to the artist ;-)

If you need paper or T-shirts, call Epson at 800 922 8911.
Unfortunately, these neanderthals don't have the paper or
T-shirts on their web site. The T-shirts are completely
standard Hanes Beefy T-shirts, and AFAIK just about anything
will work. The paper's stock number is SE41001

(Yes I'm new to this list, so cut me some slack if I'm offbalance :-)

No slack needed.  You made very good comments.  Thanks.
I have clarified my question, partially in light of your good comments.

Guns are tools, and tools are useful.  But "usefullness" is not enough to be
extropian.  Are guns merely useful tools, or are they somehow extropian?  Are
they transending tools of transhumans, or are they ordinary tools of humans?
Are they futuristic intelligent technology, or are they old-style technology
from the past?

It was late last night (early this morning actually) when I first posted this
question.  Now that I am thinking more clearly, let me try to answer my own
question in an obvious and direct way.  We have the extropian principals which
define extropy.  I believe that life-extension, smart AI, and the like serve
these principals and are therefore extropian.  A hammer does not serve these
principals, although it may be a useful tool to an extropian doing some
extropians things.

So lets look at guns in light of the extropian principals and see how they
serve them.  Since I may be biased, not being a gun owner, I would like to hear
from gun advocates to see how they rate guns as extropian.

1.  Do guns promote Boundless Expansion?
        seek more intelligence, wisdom, effectiveness?
        increase lifespan?
        remove limits to selfactualization and self-realization?
        overcome constraints on progress and possibilities?
        expand into the universe advancing without end?

        My answer, no.  Guns only limit or terminate someone's ability for
        Boundless Expansion.  I think guns are only useful where one has
        decided that it is not possible for one's own future goals to co-exist
        with anothers, so that the other's plans for the future must be
        thwarted.  The gun is the tool used to stop the other from
        achievingd their future goals.  This seems anti-extropian by
        definition.  Only by using this unextropian tool against an
        unextropian person, does this indirectly promote extropian goals
        by destroying competeing unextropian goals.  This does not directly
        push extropians forward, but pushes the nonextropians farther back.

2.  Do guns promote Self-Transformation?
        affirm continual moral, intellectual, and physical self-improvement?
        work through reason and critical thinking, personal responsibility?
        seek biological and neurological augmentation?

        My answer, no.  Guns are not a tool for self-growth.  This is not
        applicable to guns.

3.  Do guns promote Dynamic Optimism?
        fuel dynamic action with positive expectations?
        adopt a rational action-based optimism?
        shun blind faith and stagnant pessimism?

        My answer, no.  Guns are required for the worst-case or bad-case
        scenario.  It implies that coexistance is not possible, peaceful
        resolution is not possible, and that threat of death or actual death
        will be required in future situations.  This may be an accurate
        assessment of the future, but it is not a positive expectation or
        an optimistic one.

4.  Do guns promote Intelligent Technology?
        Apply science and technology creatively to transcend "natural" limits?

        My answer, no.  Guns are low-technology.  Low-technology may be the
        best answer in certain cases, but it is not high technology,
        intelligent technology, or extropian technology.  Again, this does not
        mean that guns aren't the right answer, but that they are not the I.T.
        answer.

5.  Do guns promote Spontaneous Order
        support decentralized, voluntaristic social coordination processes?
        foster tolerance?
        diversity?
        long-term thinking?
        personal responsibility?
        individual liberty?

        My answer, no... but I'm not totally sure about this one.
        Guns can support decentralized social coordination and individual
        liberty.  I wouldn't call the use of guns a voluntaristic process.
        Guns are a coersive process to force someone to cooperate who does not
        wish to do so.  Tolerance requires acceptance, while guns are used
        where other options are not acceptable.  I don't think guns work with
        long-term thinking.  Guns seem more of an immediate reaction with no
        chance for long-term consideration after they are used.  I do see
        where protecting one's own individual liberty could use guns.  But
        I don't see the guns fostering the liberty, but more of countering
        those who conflict with one's liberty.

The bottom line:  I think guns are low-tech, old-style tools.  They are not
futuristic, intelligent technology.  Guns destroy someone else's future options
to limit their potential.  (Hopefully because that person's future plans are
deemed to be "bad".)  They do not create options or expand future options.
Guns are only useful in negative situations that are not progressing in an
extropian-desireable manner.

Instead of pushing us "Onward and Upward", guns push our competition "Backward
and Downward".  In a competitive race this makes us seem farther ahead by
comparison, but it doesn't move us any closer to the finish line.  If there has
to be a choice between "us" and "them", most people would choose "us".  But I
would hope that future technology will develop effective tools to protect "us"
without having to destroy "them" in return.  That would be an extropian tool.

I think good martial arts training and self-defense would be more
effective than pulling another gun in a dangerous situation.

I think we agree on the situation.  If you aren't promoting guns as a
goal for an extropian future, but rather as an unavoidable evil right
now, then we are agreed.

I think technology will be developed for personal protection without
having to resort to attacking others.  Detecting weapons before they get
close, disabling weapons, shielding oneself all are more directly
related to safety than spreading weapons around so everyone will have
them.

It seems we are agreed on goals and "wishes" for the future.

You are probably right, but...  Currently in Florida we have:
- a two-year old who shot his mom
- an old man holed-up in his house shooting at passers-by
- kids taking guns to school and trying to shoot teachers
- a man resisting arrest with a gun
- a drive-by shooting, possibly drug related

... all reported on the news while I am writing this.  This is a typical
day in one local Florida town.  And I live live in a cow-town with
barb-wired fences and swamps.  I'm not saying it's the wild west, but it
isn't a crime-free paradise either.  Don't anybody move to Florida
thinking that the crime rate is low.  It's not.

In all of the debate over guns and rights and crime and punishment, this

etc. etc.

Correct me if I'm wrong; it appears that you're advocating a society
where everybody is armed to allow individuals to protect themselves
against other 'dysfunctional' members of the society.  IMHO this is only
addressing a secondary problem (ie. a recognized problem which is
actually caused by a primary, unidentified problem).

The primary problem is that the number of 'dysfunctional' members
seems to be  increasing.  Arming everybody is simply masking the
primary problem.  The number of murders and other violent acts might
decrease, but the number of people capable of the act remains the
same.  This is not something which can be solved by purely
technological means (whether gun, or ray-taser - raser?) - there is no
single magic bullet solution (sorry, couldn't help myself).

Creating a society whose principles revolve around rationality, critical
thought and individual responsibility is definitely part of the answer.

>I don't want to say guns are bad, or argue about guns per se.

As a European it seems obvious to me that guns or no guns is a choice. There
are basically two scenarios. "No guns at all", which most European countries
wants, and "at least a gun pr. person." which many Americans wants.

Many of you Americans feels in your hearts and souls that you have the right
to defend youreselves with guns, and I can fully appreciate this. I don't
agree, but then we don't have to.

All this throwing statistics around is just a mental exercise in
interpretation. (statistics, more statistics and damn lies :-)) It is really
just a way to justify ones oppinions. I find it pretty fruitless though.

One thing is for shure. For most Europeans this gun debate is a complete
turn-off, and can be a very negative factor when reading this list. There is
far to much debate on this list concerning guns!!!!

Normally I as a European don't consider guns at all because I don't have to.
I don't even consider violence because it has no place in my daily life.
(Murders pro capita here in Denmark is 1/10 of that in the States.)

Doesn't this Gun debate belong someplace else???? I cannot for the life of
me se what it has got to do with Transhumanism and Extropy. Also it is a
very American problem. Most Europeans doesn't have it and doesn't want it
and don't se the gun debate as a problem at all because it doesn't exist and
no one miss it.

Just a Danish/Scandinavian/European POW.

If guns save lives, they are extropian.
If pencils save lives, they are extropian.
Both are extropian _sometimes_. 

A pencil is a deadly weapon, too. I can think of an even half dozen ways to
take a human life with one, and I'm not even a student of such matters.

As the individual capacity to direct energy and shape matter becomes
greater, the number of things which could be turned to foul ends can only
increase. Unless you want to page Gort and have his robot buddies run
things. I don't feature living in a remake of "The Day The Earth Stood
Still." Do you?

Think of guns as the existence proof, the "you must be at least this tall"
sign and the politician's litmus test for an extropian world/universe.

As more power is concentrated in your computers, expect them-and-yourself
to be treated exactly the way others-and-their-guns are treated. How are
you going to prove you have a trigger lock on that GP assembler, hombre?
How are you going to convince me you can be trusted with that Orion engine
you plan to build?

Fools are fools, no matter what they have in their hands. The problem here
is impulse control, not guns. Self government makes the whole gun matter a
non-issue. Absent more prevalent self government, the human race has a very
dim future.

Florida's violent crime rate per 100,000:

   1990 1220.9
   1995 1061.6

In what branch of mathematics does a 15% drop equal a rise?

Duh, not like a 15% drop in state government reported violent crime
figures is evidence or anything. Maybe it's risen since, but they don't
give those figures so I can't tell; either way it dropped after the
concealed carry law was passed.

For Transvision '98 Dutch transhumanist Henri Kluytmans made a Coreldraw

	Well, when you define guns, I guess you are defining them as conventional
old style weapons that shoot physical projectiles..   Is an Ion Cannon that
destroys an incoming asteroid that could destroy our planet earth a low
tech old style tool/gun, or a high tech useful gun ?  ..   those are the

"gun"..

Which is one reason why I don't think most Europeans understand the
implications of what we're talking about. Seems to me that guns are the
litmus test of whether you've really considered the things we talk about
on this list. If you're scared of people having guns, then how are you
going to handle nanotech, SIs, etc; technologies which are far more of
a threat than a wimpy little gun ever will be?

>Most Europeans doesn't have it and doesn't want it
>and don't se the gun debate as a problem at all because it doesn't exist and
>no one miss it.

No, most Europeans just want to ban gun ownership outside government and 
hope the problem goes away; as we've seen on this list before, many 
European subscribers want to do the same for the other technologies we 
talk about.

>Just a Danish/Scandinavian/European POW.

I was under the impression that several Scandinavian countries had militias
who kept automatic weapons at home?

    Mark

P.S. And if Europe's so great, why is it that suicide rates are typically 
at least twice as high as America? This is another issue which is ignored
in these discussions about reducing freedom to save lives; the freer people
are, the less they tend to kill themselves.

I think it's likely that concealed carry laws will result in higher 
gun crimes for the period it takes to purge out those who pass the 
tests but are unsuited to the responsibility. Once past this hump, 
the 'polite society' that has been mentioned should take over.

This is one of the more insightful comments made to date on this issue, IMO.
Trying to solve the crime problem by arming everyone is treating the
symptom.  A more transcendent approach, it seems to me, would be to do
everything we can to eliminate Antisocial Personality Disorders (APDs) and
help would-be criminals to become higher level humans.  Get rid of this
single personality disorder and you will have solved a huge part of the
problem.  Yes there will still be people with impulse control disorders that
commit violent crimes (this will also hopefully be very treatable in the
future), but the chronic and pervasive character of the APD is the driving
force behind a large percentage of crimes of all sorts.  The Truth Machine
was a good read but it seemed to make the same mistake of not addressing the
underlying problem of mental disorder.  Being forced to tell the truth
doesn't make the APD go away.  It's going to take biomedical advances or
genetic screening or something else to eventually address this more
fundmental problem.  Stamping out the problem means employing what's called
a primary (preventative) intervention rather than a tertiary one (e.g. gun
proliferation).  You can arm the citizenry if you want, but the APD will
find a way to express itself.  I want society to be polite, not because it's
armed and scared to be anything but polite, but because it really feels like
being polite.

I can already hear the pro-gun responses:

"Yeah, but until they figure out how to stamp our APDs . . . arm everyone!"

I know it doesn't address short-term issues and I'm not against owning a
gun, and if it does come down to you or him . . . let it be you.  I just
don't think that more guns is going to make the problem go away.

IMHO, harv@gate.net (Harvey Newstrom) breathed some much-needed reason into
the gun discussion we've been having here.  His conclusions (it seems to me),
which I heartily endorse, are that guns are tools and "are extropian" only to
the extent that they are USED in a fashion that furthers the principles and
values we share.  

(I might quibble about Harvey's discussion of the "high" or "low" tech-ness of
"guns" in general: Within a particular engineering regime, "high tech" to me
is simply the best possible solution to a particular engineering problem.
Thus, given a praticular set of operational specifications, a darn good
argument can be made that a S&W .44 revolver, employing a design little
changed in 100 years, is "high tech.)

The gun discussion tends to come and go here in the context of discussions of
individual liberty as a value in society.  It IS a "hot button" issue for many
libertarians in the U.S., so even relatively casual remarks can initiate a
discussion of individual ownership and control of weapons.  We've probably had
quite enough gun talk here for a while, but I would urge my fellow gun-owners
to consider how the issue is perceived by folks from outside the U.S., and to
try to be diplomatic in their rhetoric: What may seem self-evident and basic
to someone grounded in U.S. history and society can seem shocking and
threatening to others.

Here's a weird one:

Some researchers claiming to have negative-resistance carbon fibers which
when combined with normal fibers give zero resistance. What they're saying
baffles me (and I only took my Physics degree a few years ago), but it may 
be of interest if it's real.

People who go through all the hassle of getting legal carry permits are
the kind of people who don't break the laws in other ways; and since very
few violent crimes are committed by people who don't have a prior record,
they wouldn't get permits anyway. Of course the criminals don't care and
just carry illegally.

Possibly a shift in the thread..

A laser sufficiently powerful to ionize an air column strongly enough 
to carry current sufficient to deter or injure a human would by 
itself be a very dangerous or lethal weapon. Death ray, anyone?

The other business I am involved in seeks nonlethal solutions to 
problems such as high speed car chases and similar situations where 
the police now use guns or main force. One idea I had was a charged 
stream of liquid to carry a current, a'la taser. I constructed a 
prototype with two Super Soakers mounted on a common pistol grip, and 
a 20 kV pulse generator connected so that the water streams would 
complete a circuit on the target. Testing resulted in the conclusion 
that a liquid stream cohesive enough to act at greater than three 
feet range would in itself carry enough energy to be able to seriousl 
injure the person aimed at. Also, simply wearing a raincoat renders 
the gadget useless.

About this time I applied for a patent on the device on the chance it 
could be somehow debugged - and found that another company had beaten 
us to the punch. Their disclosure, unfortunately, missed all the 
information my experiments turned up, so that their device is likely 
also useless.

Other ideas could be use of phased sound - low frequencies have been 
shown to disorient wihtout causing permanent harm, but are terribly 
hard to project, and ultrasonics can cause discomfort, but the power 
level needed is again possibly dangerous. There has been mention in 
trade journals of an ultrsonic 'speaker' that can direct audio to an 
apparent location in free space by using collimated ultrasonic beams 
that have beat notes in the range of the desired frequency. The air 
itself becomes the radiator. 

Perhaps I have said too much...

If you look at this from a different angle, the gun can be used to 
prevent non-extropian persons from coercing the extropian.. They can 
allow you to continue your boundless expansion in the face of those

Please stop with the 'guns destroy' meme. A tool can not do anything 
without a user, and we must start forcing the concept of personal 
responsibility back into the public conciousness. Unless someone 
picks up a gun and uses it, it's just a lump of metal.

Every time the media repeats this line, people get more and more 
isulated from thinking of the person who used the gun, and his/her 
personal responsibility for their actions.

Guns cannot push our competition anywhere, unless we take them up and 
do some attacking. This does not seem particularly Extropian to me, 
and I will not be using my weapons except in self defense of imminent 
danger.

Why must we destroy anyone? How about education?

No, it's a decentralized, spontaneous order solution, rather than something

And when Transhumanism is defined as an Antisocial Personality Disorder?
Bye-bye, dude...

Why is it that some many people seem to think that if they set up a huge
centralized system it will do precisely what they want it to do, and not
be used against them? Set up a power structure and it will be used by 
precisely the kind of antisocial power freaks you fear.

Indeed, see the discussions on the "balanced budget" yesterday. It's
very precise, totally true, yet tells you nothing about reality.

  Just out of curiosity, what do you consider common APDs?

To address the primary problem:

We need to identify the root causes of violence and it's spread. IMO, 
one big reason today is the war on some drugs that just got a billion 
dollar shot in the arm from the govt.

If we could eliminate illegal drugs as a consideration, how many 
instances of violence would fade away? The media in turn would no 
longer be reporting either the violence or glorifying the lifestyles 
illegal drugs entail. A feedback loop would be broken.

With the savings realized by not fighting this useless war, we can 
spend a pittance ($billions?) on research into root causes of self 
destructive and criminal behavior, and just maybe find a fix or two..

	1 G in acceleration is 32 feet per second, per second, right?

	That means if I'm accelerating in my race car (which I plan to do tonight
at the local drag strip), with slicks..   if I cover 32 feet in < 1 second,
I've pushed for more than 1 G "off the line", and if I cover 96 feet in < 2
seconds, I've accelerated at more than 1 G for the first 100 feet,
basically, right?

	(I'm making a bet that i can pull > 1 G in the first 60 feet of the track
with a friend, and he believes it is completely impossible for a street car
w/slicks to accomplish this)...  

	Just wanted to make sure my math was okay..

However, according to Gary Kleck's research the deterrent effect works 
both ways; criminals are deterred from attacking people with guns, but
also criminals with guns are deterred from physical attacks because the 
guns are likely to kill if used. A criminal with a gun is less likely to 
use it than a criminal with a knife... and a criminal with a non-lethal 
weapon like this will just shoot you from cover then rob you, rape you
or whatever and run away.

So non-lethal weapons may *increase* the crime rate, not reduce it. Unless
you're miraculously going to prevent criminals getting them... but if you 
could do that we could do it with normal guns too.

Yes, good point. It is utterly absurd to think that technology and 
knowledge will eliminate war, suffering and evil. New technology
has *always* been used to make more powerful weapons, and intelligence
and benevolnence are not specifically linked, just as malice and
stupidity aren't specifically linked. Although future technologies
don't necessarily have to cause a full-flung armageddon (after all,
we still haven't used the nukes), there *will* be plenty of violence
around. Certainly if your ambitions include becoming a SI you'd
*better* be prepared to fight for it. After all, some of the meansest,
smartest and most power-hungry people on the planet will be after 
the same goal (and I don't think they want to share).

The gun debate may not/hardly exist around here (due to a brainwashed
consensus not unlike the one against (human)cloning -- all the same
paranoia, xenophobic, media-manipulated thing), but the *crime problem*
_does_ exist. By denying the problem, it won't go away. It's time to
toughen up those santctimonious, criminal-loving socialist laws, and
get tough on crime. Arming the law abiding citizens is one major
step in that direction, as are extensive surveillance networks and
(crucial) tough sentences, legalization of victimless crimes and a 
quick and efficient justice system.

If I understand the time dialation effect correctly, the ship could 
accelerate at 1G forever, and during this time the power requirment 
would be the same.  But due to time dialation a obserber on a 
"stationary" planet would never see the rocket go faster than light.
(This is if the power source on onboard.)

First, Lets Meta this discussion (and future discussions) with
[GUNS] so that those wishing to filter them may do so.

You are largely correct, guns are largely a low-tech old style
tool. Unfortunately they are still the best tool to achieve certain
goals. An attacker's goal is to force someone to do something they
otherwise would not, and a defenders goal is to prevent such
coercion.

I for one will gladly change my guns in the day a better tool is
available. A startrek type Phaser would be perfect. Untill then I
will decide how best to protect this transhuman and his friends. 

Excluding my military experience, there have been at least two
occasions where a gun enabled this extropian to continue on. There
have been a number of other occasions where one may have prevented
injury to myself/others.

We are largely in agreement, we do need to take additional action
to attempt to prevent such occurrences but society seems unwilling
to do so.

In almost every interview I've watched, especially those of the
recent child/school incidents, every one of these perps has shown
symptoms of APD's, yet nothing was done. Plus the press continues
to romanticize these crimes. (everyone of these kids is smirking
before the camera) The perps are paraded before the cameras wearing
bulletproof vests, (why? the last thing you would want is for them
to feel safe, or invulnerable) then an endless series of experts
comes on to tell us why it isn't their fault.

By the same token, the solution to stopping gun violence has been
known for a long time, put the offenders in jail and keep them
there, but people prefer to pretend these people are "victims"
rather than criminals.

I also agree with those who suggest that martial arts training is
a good idea, it is a poor craftsman who only has one tool. 

Unfortunately my pal "Ching-Ching" is the badest martial artist on
the planet.

Yes, I've read about these on the net. The usual configuration is
a truck-mounted electrified water cannon that can be used against 
crowds. Another interesting potential police weapon is a sort of
super taser that's integrated into a police car. In a chase, a 
harpoon on a wire is shot into the rear of criminal's car, and
a powerful current fries the car's circuitry, stopping the engine
and the chase. There are no harmful side effects to the car's
occupants, besides being arrested of course. 

I've been thinking about a more modest device myself, namely
a stun gun/pepper spray combination (one weapon). This would 
allow you to temporarily disorientate the attacker with the spray,
so that you can move in and zap him. An additional feature could
that the stun gun has different settings for intensity levels,
so that the shock can be adjusted to the target. This is
especially handy for police use (all those poor unarmed
bobbies should have one, for example).

The anti-crowd version may work, but it probably never be much
of a side arm. Could be a fun sport though, like paintball.

Could mediums such as water be used by the sound waves
to travel over great distances to a kill zone (where possibly several
waves from different locations converge and amplify eachother) with
lethal results to man and beast? If so, submarines, or surface
ships, could be fitted with powerful sonic guns instead of cumbersome
torpedoes and depth charges. One would think that their nuclear
power plants could generate quite some energy for a shockwave.
It's certainly a very "clean" and discrete weapon, and leaves
no traces (a pocket version would be a great murder weapon,
causing heart attacks and strokes without leaving any tangible
evidence).

Probably, but Canada is far less homogeneous than, ay, many European
countries that have similar low crime rates.  While we don't have the
anywhere near the number of blacks and hispanics that the U.S. does, we
were largely populated by the same waves of immigrants from Europe that
came to the U.S., and per capita I think we have a larger Asian population.
And, unlike the U.S., Canada has two official languages, stemming from the
English and French founders of the country.

What's the worst that can happen? I'm not sure, but an asteroid hitting the
Earth and wiping out all human life would be pretty bad.  If I expected
that to happen, I'd probably use the resources I possess to enjoy myself in
whatever time remained. Of course doing so would probably indicate poor
risk assessment on my part, because AFAIK there's no evidence that an
asteroid is due.  Given infinite resources, you can prepare for any
eventuality; given finite ones, you have to pick and choose.  If you've
found a way to gain infinite resources, please drop my a note explaining
how ;->

That's an interesting conjecture; do you have any evidence to back it up?
As a counter-example, I would cite England, which does not seem to be
self-destabalizing.  In terms of outside interference, it's unclear to me
what, if any, correlation there is between a country's micro-MAD policy and
its ability to resist such interference. To take an example cloer to home,
Quebec has been threatening to leave Canada for a long while now -- it's
almost a national sport -- but thus far there have been virtually no
threats of violence. And belive me, it's not the prospect of U.S.
intervention that's keeping the discussion (more or less) civil.

I agree with this, but don't understand how individual gun ownership
logically follows from it.

	Yeah, me too.  I've already got the T-shirt from the extropy

I think you've got this backwards.  If everyone were armed, your "APD"
types would promptly get removed from the gene pool when they went nuts,
eliminating the problem at its source.

In your Brave New World scenario, where these people are sought out and
kept sociable via happy drugs or what-have-you, they would continue to be
fruitful and multiply.

Still, as individuals, we don't have a choice between these options--we can
neither arm everyone nor initiate the Brave New World.  We can only choose
whether to empower ourselves via arms, or not.

You're thinking of the Swiss. I think.

I don't recall there being militias of the Swiss type in Denmark. I 
wouldn't be surprised if there was a national guard of sorts in the 
vodka belt countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) that had some sort of 
Swiss-style arrangement. But I don't think there is.

OTOH, gun ownership for hunting purposes (almost always a shotgun) is 
perfectly legal in all Scandinavian countries. I should also mention
that according to people who (claim to) know, the shotgun is also 
a good weapon for self-defense anyway.

Easy there. Europe's just different. And each of the European countries 
are different from each other. And every single one of the residents in 
each of those countries is different from each other. As they are from 
you.

Besides. Perhaps Europeans are just better at keeping these stats?

Guns as tools?

Well,  they certainly are working agents in memetics.  "You change your
ideality,  or I'll shoot you",  hey - who needs bait and switch?
Seriously,  I'm placing this question of guns on the same tier as the
racial problems in the world today.  Both are self-perpetuating nightmares,
 that if you ask any 'normal' individual,  you'll find to be unwanted.

How does this situation self-perpetuate?  Isn't that the ultimate virus?
Well,  let's think about this one...  I once posted to this list about an
essay on slavery,  eventually I finished my essay on Emmanuel Eze's take on
Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.... So what?  Well,  Eze came to the
conclusion that the problem remains because we attempt to fight it too much.  

Hatred begets hatred,  violence begets violence and guns beget guns...

As has been proved on this list.  "I'd rather be more well-stocked than my
opponent".  While I suppose that works on an individual level,  that will
NEVER get rid of the problem on the massive level that 'we' want to see.
Perhaps martyrdom is what's best in this situation.  For I know,  that as
important I view my life to be,  I'd rather be killed by a gun,  than be
forced to kill another.  I don't own a gun,  I don't WANT to own a gun....
yet I feel secure in the knowledge that I'm actually living my ideology.  I
don't like guns,  or the gun problem,  so I'm living the solution - setting
the example.

As with racial problems,  the gun problem is NOT a superficial one.  It's
my belief that it boils down to the level of basic human nature.  While Eze
wrote his paper of "post-racial politics",  he was contradicting his own
thesis - he couldn't leave the race issue alone.  My paper,  which received
an A+ btw (smile) - talked of "post-human nature".  Is this what we need?  

I apologize for my ramblings.

The DSM-IV describes it thusly:

A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others
occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three or more of the
following:

(1)  failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as
indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.

(2) deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or
conning others for personal profit or pleasure.

(3) impulsivity or failure to plan ahead

(4) irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated physical fights
or assaults

(5) reckless disregard for safety of self or others

(6) consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain
consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations

(7)  lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing
having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

I don't see how the definitions for Transhumanism

I'm having a hard time correlating this response
to my post.  What does advocating the treatment
of mental illness have to do with advocating a
huge centralized power structure?

That statement is most certainly a gross

in the mental health field, but you're entitled to
your opinion.

Yes, that's another approach.  We could just kill all the APDs when they
misbehave! It seems like the crux of our differences lies in that you see
the criminal as a bad person and I see the criminal as a sick person.

Brave New World?  Happy Drugs?  Kinda stretchin things aren't ya?
Extropians would certainly consider gene therapy or drugs that were designed
to enhance our life spans or our intelligence.  Why would we not be
interested in personality enhancements as well?

I agree.  I only add that neuroscience needs to continue its efforts to
understand personality structure and development so that effective
treatments can be found.  BTW, APDs almost always have conduct disorder
problems as teens and many come from environments that are nurturing.

If it's real and can taken literally, it should be of great interest.  
Most likely they've goofed, or the effect is much less general than they've
described.  If you put a negative R into the solutions of a standard RLC 
curcuit equation (which I'm staring at at the moment), you get exponential
growth in current.  So at the very least this effect must be valid only
within a limited current range.  And by P = I^2 R, this would seem to be
an energy source, which could only work for a limited time.

I take it you accessed the Jaycor website. Due to some small problems 
with physics, the 'harpoon' idea cannot work, too bad for them. The 
inductance of the wire to the harpoon prevents the electric charge 
from having a risetime quick enough to induce currents in the engine 
controls that could stop the target car.

Our company is marketing a rocket propelled pulse generator that 
actually passes under the target vehicle, and has produced over two 
dozen kills in actual use, although no one has yet tried this in a 
real police chase. With luck, that may be remedied before fall..

Check out http://www.mcs.net/~ckuecker/nlt.html for our vision..

By the way, Jaycor is the company with the patent on the water 
cannon. One implementation uses a single stream with a pad on the 
shooter's foot completing the circuit through the ground. Real bad 
idea if the shooter lifts that foot while firing..

These exist. Do a search on non-lethal weapons and you will find

Definitely - any beat-note interactions that work in air should work 
in water, with many times the power density possible. Think of three 
or more ships fitted with these devices ringing in an enemy vessel 
from outside of visual range, and coordinating their outputs to 
produce explosive cavitation directly under the hull of the target. 
Just like the explosion of a torpedo, it could break the ship's 
keel..

I would like details on the pocket nuclear powered death ray...

	Why would negative resistance have to INCREASE the energy?
Because if it "pulls" the energy to the other side, it's actually
increasing the
energy ?   I wonder if the cable degrades over time, decreasing it's "negative
resistance" characteristic...?

  I'm concerned about who decides the sick from the healthy, for instance
Trent Lot considers homosexuals "sick" but a many people do not share his
views, but Mr. Lot is in a position of some power and he can influence
the content of laws to enforce his view of illness or at least stop bills
from even coming up for debate. Or how about the lying, backstabbing, and
general unethical behavior that occurs at many levels of corporations and
goverments. I consider some of that behavior to be "sick", but I can't 
directly influence laws or decide who goes onto the committe that writes
the report on who is considered "sick" or healthy.

second you've gone 32 feet , after 2 sec 128 feet, after 3 sec 288 feet.

Standard disclaimer:  I'm new to the list, I'm not intended to be
inflamatory, feel free to enlighten me, etc.

I agree guns aren't particularly "extropian," but I find it difficult to
reply without turning this into a off-topic discussion of gun-politics.
Briefly, I view guns as tools for self-defense which have good reliability,
effectiveness, cost, etc. compared to other available mechanisms (i.e.
pepper spray, tasers -- yes, this is debatable...) and which are regretably
necessary at times/places.  I view the purpose of a self-defense tool as
"instant incapacitation" -- while I'd like it if guns could be just as
effective yet not potentially lethal, I can see how human bodies have
evolved as very reliable, fault tolerate systems which are not easily
incapacitated without risking great bodily injury.

When you [Newstrom] speak of guns being used to "...to stop the other from
achieving their future goals" I think you overly dignify the "goals" of the
attacker who is violating someone else's right to life, liberty or
private-property.  Certainly there is great potential in the future for
conflicts -- say, over great disparities of nanotech-generated wealth, or
over moral issues such as cloning, uploading or identity after upload, but
I believe persons who refuse to settle these conflicts peacefully, in
accordance with the principles of personal liberty and individual
responsibility deserve to have their threat of aggression met with equal
force -- even if that means they suffer serious injury or die.  If the
choice is forced upon you by an aggressor, is it more extropian to preserve
their life or your liberty?  

All this raises the real question: Why is the aggressor aggresively-violent
in the first place?  IOW, will everyone in the ideal extropian future be
well-adjusted and content, or at least enough so to not be violent?  I
don't think so -- at the very least, there'll always be psycho's or
fanatical groups baring with _mandatory_ psych. testing/psychotherapy.

So, how in general can society protect itself against small fanatical
groups armed with potentially very destructive technologies such as
nanotech or generic engineering?  This question must have been discussed on
this list.  Drexler suggested hiding the details of initial development, or
developing "active shields" (the first Microsoft nanotech product? :-)
BTW, if active shields have been discussed extensively before, I'd
appreciate a pointer on the subject...


Another thought:  would society recognize the first uploaded humans as
"persons", entitled to life and liberty and protection from "murder" by
someone turning off the power?  Probably not, not at first and an uploadie
attempting self-defense with weapons in this case would probably just
produce a huge negative backlash (headline: "software bug results in
shooting".)  A better solution would be 1. getting away from non-extropians
(i.e., in a space colony), 2. building a foundation of understanding about
uploading, possibly even getting laws enacted beforehand, or 3. "running"
uploadies on fault-tolerate hardware :-)

That chart shows all crimes including non-gun crimes.  Total crimes are
down, but the percent of violent crimes using guns is way up.

<http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/murder.asp>
shows per-capita murders down between 1990-1995, but gun murders up from
62.9% to 66.7%.

<http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/robbery.asp>
shows per-capita robberies way down between 1990-1995, but gun robberies
up from 37.6% to 38.9%.

<http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Crime_in_Brief/aggravated_assault.asp>
does not show the same trend for aggravated assaults.  (Maybe assaults
are spontaneous for anybody whereas murders and robberies are planned by
criminals?)

I'm new to this subject, but I've learned some from this thread.  I
think you said something like- egoism is wrong because assuming it has
universal acceptance in the population is worse off than a universal
acceptance of utilitarianism.  But wouldn't a universal acceptance of
utilitarianism in a population of inter-actors be an evolutionarily
unstable system?  That would assume no defectors and leave us highly
vulnerable to potential defectors.  This is the same problem as the
recent poster that thought we could eventually rid the world of evil. 
Yes, egoism is not perfect in that it depends on pockets of
utilitarianism.  But, what I think I've just said is that
utilitarianism is not perfect in that it depends on pockets of egoism.
 There is no utopia.  NO UTOPIA.

Never drive a car without a rear view mirror. Sure you are only
interested in moving forward, but you also have to make sure you don't
get blindsided or run over by someone coming up behind you. Sounds like
you are only interested in driving with blinders on.

As for 'destroying someone else's future options', if someone uses
deadly force in an act of agression against me, then they have voided
their right to enjoy any future options, since they obviously have no
regard for my future options. Get it?

However, it takes years of regualr training to become proficient enough
to utilize these skills sufficiently to enable an unarmed individual to
disarm an armed attacker, and what happens when the armed attacker is
also proficient in martial arts?

Given the available resources of the individual, maximizing survival of the
individual would obviously require utilization of available resources for all cost
effective measures within a given risk range. Of course, the more resources
available to the individual, the wider the individuals risk range that he or she
is capable of responding to. Spending a couple hundred dollars on a gun, ammo,
training, and equipment to keep the gun secure is much more likely to give a high
rate of return on investment than a life insurance policy premium, just as an air
bag is a similarly cheap investment with high returns for the individual.

Actually, from what freinds of mine in Montreal have told me, there is significant
amount of anti-English hostility in the french speaking population, and I and
people I know who do business with companies in Quebec have found that some people
at these companies will not talk to you in English anymore, even though you have
dealt with them in English previously. I find this behavior in marked contrast to
all non-Quebecois Canadians I know, who tend to be polite almost to a fault. I
predict that within 10 years we will see an active Quebec Liberation
Front....unless the rest of Canada just tells them to go for it. Considering that
Quebec is a major economic drag on the rest of Canada, its easy to understand why
most sane Quebecois are reluctant to actually follow through with secession.

Sorry if I boggle from what I see as an act of stubbornly purposeful blindness..

If all sovereign power comes from the individual, and sovereign powers (i.e.
nations) are recognised as having the right of self defense against agression,
then the individual has a right of self defense against agression.

Since it is widely recognised that trying to uninvent technology through
legislation is a fruitless exercise, trying to ban guns only takes guns away from
law abiding individuals.
Therefore since agressors, criminals, are going to have guns whether or not they
are made illegal or not, disarming law abiding individuals is violating an
individuals right of self defense.

Since it is also recognised that gun-control only removes guns from the hands of
civilians, not from the hands of the government, then the civilian population has
no means of fighting on an equal footing against a government which has become
malevolent due to the lack of oversight by the civilian population. In any state
which recognises that power is delegated from the individual to the state, failing
to keep the means of self defense in the hands of the individual is abdicating the
individuals ability to affect enforcement of its contract of delegation with the
state. If the individual cannot affect enforcement of its contract of delegation
with the state, the individual serves at the whim of the state, not vice versa,
and is therefore a slave.

Yes. If you are an extropian researcher who develops nanoprobes that can
reconstruct cryogenically frozen humans, then you are saving litterally billions
of lives. If a government agent comes to you, points a gun in your face and tries
to kill you, is your killing that agent right or wrong? There is a difference
between killing and murder.

Hardly. Self government mandates self defense to whatever level the individual
feels negates the accepted risk level.

  IAN: Or how about: "Turn in your guns
  or I'll shoot you" ?  The case for gun
  CONTROL is a case FOR guns, specifically
  for one group (the Govt) having them all
  and one group (The People) having none.
  Power to The People, er, I mean Govt!


>Hatred begets hatred,  violence begets violence and guns beget guns...


  IAN: It's a clear error to imply that 
  gun control is anti-gun, when it is 
  definitionally pro-gun-fascism. When
  has a law been enforced by a Govt 
  that used no guns to enforce the law?

  It's like Karl Marx's "anti-Capitalism"
  based upon the Communist Party Platform 
  that states in its fifth plank:

     "Centralization of credit in the 
     hands of the State, by means of 
     a national bank with state capital 
     and an exclusive monopoly."

   "Anti-gun" laws are as "anti-gun" 
   as communism was "anti-capital."

   In short, the "anti" in "anti-X law"
   doesn't refer to the 100% abolition
   of X, but rather the transfer of 
   All X to the central authorities...
   a phoney pretext for totalitarianism:

Err, as I recall, distance  equals HALF of acceleration times the square of the time.
  s = .5 a t^2
That's 16 feet in the first second, 64 after two seconds, etc. I think the original
question related to the coefficient of friction of the "slicks". If the upper bound
on coefficient of friction were 1, then you could not accelerate at >1g on a flat
surface on earth, or drive from a standing start up a > 1/1 (45 degree) slope.
I was asleep that day in class, so I don't remenber. However, my kid's tech class
did a hill-climber design contest. I'm pretty sure the best climbers were doing
just less than a 2/1 (60 degree) slope. This was with styrofoam wheels on a
sandpaper slope.

I started the posting you reference by saying that "Guns are tools, and tools
are useful."  In reference to the above example, I said that the use of guns
would be "Hopefully because that person's future plans are deemed to be 'bad'."
I concluded my posting by saying that guns are "useful in negative situations
that are not progressing in an extropian manner".

I'm sorry that this wasn't clear enough.  When I say something is not
extropian, I don't mean it is "bad", "unjustified" or "not useful".  

I would say that the writing end of a pencil is extropian, because it creates
and communicates.  The erasing end of a pencil is anti-extropian, because it
destroys and prevents communciaton.  Erasers are not bad, however.  Every
pencil I own has an eraser, because I need them.  My feelings about guns are
the same.  They limit others rather than enable ourselves.  They destroy rather
than create.  They stop actions rather than starting actions.  Sometimes such
destruction is necessary, but let's not get pro-destruction and say that such
actions are part of extropian ideals.  Such actions are to avoid the loss of
extropian potential.  But let's not confuse avoiding loss with an actual gain.

Actually, I think you hit the nail on the head.  I think the entire question of
whether guns are extropian or not is really a precursor to another more
important question:

        Are guns on-topic for the Extropians List?

Those who claim guns are pro-Extropian would probably say that guns are
on-topic for this list.  Those of us who think guns are useful tools, but not
particularly Extropian would probably say they are off-topic.

 This pretty much defines the shortfall in Dan's
 argument that the two observers measured the other 
 as smaller free from reference to something larger,
 and thus (stated in error) a zero-sum isn't found.


Every thing, A, is measured by its deviation from zero A.

                   zero A = no A

Every measured unit of A is a displacement from 0 A:

                   0A--->1A--->2A

The positive displacement of 1 from 0 is symmetrical to 
the negative displacement of 0 from 1, and the measurement
taking place is equally both displacements, one displacement
is not a more valid representation of the measure taking place:

          0--->1 = (+1) = (1 is 1 more than 0)

          0<---1 = (-1) = (0 is 1 less than 1)

The degree to which 1 is larger (+) than 0 is equal and opposite 
to the degree that 0 is smaller (-) than 1. Indeed, the statement 
"1 is 1 unit more than 0" tells us the same thing as the statement
"0 is 1 unit less than 1."  This  equality  expresses the equality
of the degree to which both of the symmetrical displacements shown 
above between 0 and 1 are valid representations of the measure of 
difference between 1 and 0. We can express the equal validity of 
each side of the 0,1 difference as such, where "v" = "validity":

    v( 1 is 1 more than 0 )  =  v( 0 is 1 less than 1 )

Those two equally valid statements are inverse measurements of 
the defined difference, and as such are identical to inverse 
subtractions, which are also measures of difference, thus:

       (1 is 1 more (+) than 0)  =  (1 - 0) = +1
       (0 is 1 less (-) than 1)  =  (0 - 1) = -1

Therefore, the difference between 0 and 1 is equally both 1 and 
-1, not 1 more than -1, since both statements are equally valid 
expressions of the measurement of 1 from 0. It clearly follows
therefore that the sum of all valid measurements derived from
the differentiation of 1 from 0 will = 0, since 1 + (-1) = 0.

 Negative Numbers Are "In" Positive Numbers

Negative 1 is internally "nested" within positive 1 due to the 
fact that both -1 and 1 are equally and simultaneously valid
expressions of the 0,1 relation that defines 1 as 1. All the
negative numbers are "in" the positive numbers, since each 
positive number is its difference/displacement from 0 and 
that difference is symmetrical (n + (-n)) and sums to 0. 

Whatever we measure, 1 unit of X is derived by its deviation
from 0 X, or "no X." The displacement from 0 is symmetrical
such that 1X is as much (more)X (+1) as 0X is (less)X (-1) 
and the net displacement (+1 + (-1)) always equals 0.

                     0  1  2  3
                    ____________
                 0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                   |            |
                 1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                   |            |
                 2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                   |            |
                 3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                   --------------

Every number has a discrete relation with 0, and every number
IS its difference from 0: 1 is 1 more (+) than 0, 2 is 2 more 
(+) than 0, 3 is 3 more (+) than zero, and so forth... At the 
same time, 0 is 1 less (-) than 1, 2 less (-) than 2, and 3 
less (-) than 3. The relation of n to 0 is simultaneously 
expressed by equal yet opposite values that sum to zero.

Both of those symmetrical values are valid at the same time 
just as the statement " 0 < 1 " says both "0 is less than 1" 
and "1 is more than 0" at the same time. And the sum of this
"more-less" difference always = 0, and thus the sum of all
difference must always = 0, as the matrix above proves.

But moreover: the sum of all valid measurements always = 0 
because the measurement of 1 unit of X is composed of two 
symmetrically different components that sum to 0. So all 
measurement, being founded upon the symmetrical difference
between 0 and 1, can never actually exceed a net sum of zero.

The conservation of measure is the conservation of difference.
The conservation of difference is the conservation of identity.

you are right john, it is possible to exceed 1 g acceleration on levelpavement, but its
kind
of a trick: the dragster spins the tires in chlorox to melt them a little and make them
sticky.  if a car were to pull exactly one g for the quarter mile, it would make a time
of
9.083 seconds at a final speed of just over 180.  top dragsters are down in the under 6
second range and god knows how fast they are going  at the finish line these days, i
think mid 200s.

stock motorcycles are down in the low 10s now, thats stock, no spinning the tires in
bleach,
no specialty tires.  my bike will pull a power wheelie in 2 gears, but this kind of
behavior is way
non extropian and juvenile, so i blush a little, then do it anyway... {8^D  spike

ps: i am an organ donor, and have considered the possibility of a full
body donation to some unfortunate head in the event of my untimely
demise in a murdercycle related mishap...

How reliable are these comparative figures?  It strikes me as likely that a
religiose culture like [large portions of] the USA (or Iran) might well
record deflated figures for suicide on the grounds of familial shame, etc.
Europeans are often more candid.

In particular, in the US cars are universally available. We tend to have
a great many fatal one-car accidents with only the driver in the car. There
have been several studies of this phenomenon duringhte last decade.

"Hardly"? I think you miss my point. I'll break it down: The "_*gun*_" (qua
gun) issue is a non-issue to any set of people which is largely
self-governing (no "Gummint"/minimal "Gummint"). Such people don't give a
hoot whether another of their kind owns a gun, as long as they can/do too.
Thus it is a _non-issue_ for them. Get me?

I get tired of making this point, but it boils down to "it's not about gun
control, it's about impulse control, stupid." :) High individual
self-government->high impulse control->less fear of technology X-Y-Z in
individual hands, as long as the said hands are also not cocksure or
arrogant. Are we in agreement about this?

Your "Hardly," as situated, appears to be a dismissal of my last sentence.
I stand by it. 
What say you?

There are materials where both the static and kinetic coefficient of friction 
is greater than 1 but they're rare, most are less than 1.

We well might be.  I think the point here is that we don't want them forced
upon us.  Who decides what behaviour is unacceptable?  Who decides how long
"treatment" lasts?  Before we go deciding to alter a persons personality, we
better answer these questions.

Who decides?  Well, Psychologists and Psychiatrists do and summarize the
findings of their empirical research analysis in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual Version IV.  Granted, when the DSM-III first came out
(late 80's?) homosexuality was still classified as a mental disorder, but
that error has been corrected.  This Manual is revised every several years,
not annually and changes are not considered lightly.  Point being, that if
an anti-gay bill is introduced relying on the presumtion that being gay is
being mentally ill, the opponents of the bill have a much stronger position.
Easier for bigots to use the religious argument I would think.

Strictly speaking homosexuality *is* of course a mental/genetic
disorder/abnormality (it's a glitch that prevents reproduction). The
important point is, however, whether it is a "bad" disorder, being
harmful to the carrier and/or society. The answer to that is, generally
speaking, "no". In fact it seems that many homosexuals are even more
productive/creative than the average straight person. Hyperintelligence
is for example also a "disorder", but certainly not something that
should be "treated". The urge to rape on the other hand is a good
example of something that *should* be treated if possible (which doesn't
mean that convicted rapists should just be treated and sent home, that
wouldn't be fair towards the victim(s)). The best solution is probably
to give everybody the chance to get a free/cheap treatment, and those
that refuse will be held fully accountable for their actions (no more
"insanity plea").

this is something i have been thinking about for years.  i am told thata member
is not acepted into the inner city gang culture until one
has been to prison, preferrable maximum security, for which one usually
must commit a violent crime.  result: prison is not adequately feared among
this subset.

seems we could arrange for female hormones to be added to prison
food for violent male offenders.  or perhaps even spread a rumor among
the inmates that this is being done.  if nothing else, this might cause the
young gangsters to be terrified of the lockup...  {8^D  spike

This seems what one would expect: more guns in the hands of the public
makes non-gun murders and robberies more problematical, so there are fewer
of them, while the determined murderers and robbers are forced to start
using guns.  On the whole, it seems to result in a net gain in public
safety....

In a nation with more laws on the books than every other country in the

Use an alias online, or flatter someone with white lies: that's two strikes.

Subjective enough to tar anyone: "What, you didn't anticipate being hauled
in for a mental health inspection?  Poor planning--strike three.

No one gets out of high school without earning this strike (you don't need
to be the one doing the assualting, or starting the fights).

>(5) reckless disregard for safety of self or others

Subjective.  To that little-old-lady down the street, anyone who drives
faster than 20 mph meets this description.  Curiously, the opinions of
bureaucrats are often indistinguishable from those of little-old-ladies....

Subjective.  Come to work with a hangover a few times in a decade, get a
strike.

Oh damn, I compared bureaucrats to little-old-ladys, in the process hurting
the feelings of all the little-old-ladys who read my words.  And I don't
give a damn....  Still another strike.

Using this list, the government could brand anyone they pleased with the
APD label, and remand them for mandatory "treatment", if we followed your
proposed solution to violence.  Time to go out and buy a gun (oops, two
more strikes for expressing that sentiment...).

Speaking even more strictly, the discovery of genes associated with male
homosexuality means that it is not a genetic glitch that prevents
reproduction.  The glitch that prevents reproduction seems to be a modern
memetic one, which encourages gays to "come out of the closet" instead of
trying to "act normally" by having girlfriends, marrying, etc.

So it *is* a genetic glitch which would normally prevent reproduction,
but it [the gen glitch] was/is suppressed by intolerant societies that
force gays to "keep up appearances" by marrying, having kids etc.). In
*liberal* societies "nature can take its course", and reproduction is
generally prevented since the gay person is not forced to mate with the
opposite sex, and doesn't feel the biological urge to do so.

Ummm, perhaps I should be discussing Paranoid Personality Disorders.  Let me
first address your last statement.  The government doesn't diagnose (or
using your term "brand") people with the APD label.  Psychologists and
Psychiatrists do.  Most of your objections (strained as they were in their
attempt to trivialize) related to the subjective nature of the criteria I
listed above.  You're absolutely right, diagnosis is quite subjective.
Deciding whether an individual meets any particular criterion is a matter of
clinical judgement by a trained professional.  It's common for people to see
a little bit of themselves in the above description.   Psychologists
consider pervasiveness, chronicity and severity before they recognize the
presence of psychopathology however.

I'm not very interested in this gun debate but I will make a couple points.

(1)  Defending yourself and your family (or your neighbor for that matter)
using lethal force against criminals who threaten your safety is fine by me.
I'm not anti-gun.  It just doesn't get rid of the criminal mind.  Pro-gun
activists argue that criminals are going to successfully repress deep,
ingrained personality traits because they'll be afraid the victim may be
armed.  Let's say they're right.  O.K. so what do you do if you have an
antisocial personality?  Override all the genetic and biochemical
directives, forget the negative experiences and influences of the past,
become a respectable citizen, and get a job at Wendy's?  I don't think so.
The criminal mind doesn't disappear just because you point a gun at it or
put it in prison.  It will find a way to manifest because that is its
nature.

(2)  I'm not sure what the best course would be if we had the fine-tuned
ability to reliably enhance a personality by attenuating urges to act in
ways that harm others.  What if we identify a high risk individual at 3
years of age?  If the parent says it's OK should we intervene and prevent
the formation of a dysfunctional personality?  What about an APD who has
been imprisoned for repeated robberies or murder?  Could we give him the
option of staying in prison for life or undergoing treatment and having a
shot at a more extropic and rewarding way of life?

Enough,

Scott

I see what you mean, but consider: for a gene to became widespread it
generally must confer a net reproductive advantage; which means that male
homosexuality is more than a "suppressed glitch".  Societal tolerance of
deviant sexual behavior has been a rare thing throughout history--this is
the memetic environment in which this genetic trait evolved.  It's our new
"liberal" memetic environment which has turned what used to be an advantage
into a fatal "glitch".

To wrench this discursion rudely back in the direction of the original
topic: I suspect that many of the behaviors that modern society has a
problem with have the same basis, i.e. they are strategies which evolved by
conferring advantage in a different environment (memetic and otherwise),
but which have turned into fatal flaws today.  Tomorrow might see them once
again valuable, however, so maybe we should be thinking in terms of
preserving behavioral diversity....

Time to roll up our sleeves :-)

I have extracted 28 preliminary questions/objections/reactions 
to transhumanism. In order to turn this into a good FAQ I suggest we 
do as follows. I list all the questions below so that people can 
suggest which questions should be added/modified/deleted. Replies to 
this messege should only deal with that or with issues of proceedure. 
I will then make four separate posts, spread out in time, with 7 
questions each so that we can discuss in more detail how to answer 
each question.

Anybody can comment on any question they feel like. I would like to 
collect two types of answers:

(1) Full answer: perhaps two paragraphs long (or ideas for what 
should be included in the full answer). This will form the basis for 
the FAQ.

(2) One-liners. Short replies that witty, funny, pithy, 
disarming or polemically hard to counter. These would be useful, for 
example, in debates and interviews.

When everybody has had enough time to comment I suggest that three or 
four experienced transhumanists get together (virtually) and write up 
a draft that can then be sent back to the list for further revision.

What is transhumanism?

So you think technology will solve all problems?

Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the

not the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?")

Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't
take it to heart)

Nick:

Sounds good. Have you posted the the general transhumanist list?  It seems
that a few persons who replied in the original thread are not on the
extropians list, and I don't wish to exclude anyone in this process.

Thx,

      I find it interesting.  If a quiet patriotism is a love of the 
      _idea_ of a country, call me an American.  I think of myself as 
      affiliated to Western civilization, any road.
      
      Guns _are_ interesting.  They also raise interesting practical and 
      philosophical problems.

      Our problem is that the human race has evolved exosomatically 
      (creating tools, etc) at a far faster rate than the moral and 
      instinctual development needed to restrain the vastly enhanced 
      intraspecies violence the tools make possible.  You can't do much 
      damage to someone using your fingernails and teeth.  Except by using 
      exosomatically-developed 'exotic' skills, it's pretty hard to kill 
      someone with your bare hands.

      Members of the world's intelligence community very seldom carry 
      firearms.  We can learn from this.  For my sins, I'm skilled in .22, 
      7.62, .303, 9mm. Parabellum, .45 ACP, submachineguns, light 
      machineguns and Browning Machine Gun.  The last gun I had was a .45 
      ACP auto (Remington handgun, very efficient mankiller) and one day, 
      in the 'Seventies I sat down and thought through very carefully what 
      the consequences of having it, and using it on someone could be.  I 
      eventually decided that I was better off without it -- in almost all 
      cases, using it would be counterproductive; and it's kinda hard to 
      live with the knowledge that you've killed someone.  And -- unless 
      you're extraordinarily proficient -- pretty well the _only_ way to 
      use a handgun is to shoot to kill..  With proper weapons training, 
      you do it reflexively -- you just think 'you're dead' at the target 
      and they die.


      On the other hand...  Looking at the way the United States is going 
      (especially the aptly-named criminal justice system), and depending 
      where they live, I might advise someone to have a 9mm. Browning or a 
      Glock handgun; an AK47 rifle; and (to maintain exclusion radius) 
      perhaps a Barrett Light Fifty (fires .50 caliber BMG).

      Or I might rather advise them to leave the United States.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      Last night, I watched the Director's Cut of James Cameron's 
      'Terminator 2', one of the all-time great (science-fiction) movies.  
      Linda Hamilton's performance is magnificent. The moral message, that 
      if machines can learn to cherish human life, perhaps we humans can 
      also, before it's too late, is very powerful.
      
      That reminds me of a science-fiction story from the 'Sixties, 
      whereby a nuclear weapons scientist comes home and finds his 
      five-year-old son in bed, playing with a loaded .45 revolver given 
      to him by a visiting colleague.  The scientist snarls at his 
      colleague:
      
      "What kind of madman are you, to give a loaded pistol to a child?"
      
      His colleague responds icily:
      
      "And what do you think _you're_ doing at work, then?"
      

      I happen to know Admiral Noel Gayler, who -- as Deputy Director, 
      Strategic Planning Staff at Offut AFB -- designed the Single 
      Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). America's global nuclear 
      warfighting strategy.  He went on to direct the National Security 
      Agency, and served as Commander-in-Chief for all America's Pacific

Thanks, Nick, for your effort in getting a renewed FAQ started.  I think some
of the questions obviously overlap and/or are redundant.  Accordingly, my
comments here are aimed at regrouping the questions and perhaps rephrasing
them to cover the areas of overlap.

> What is transhumanism?

That's the best first question and the answer to which we should work the
hardest at making economical an to the point.  As I mentioned before, Anders
has boiled out mot of the dross in his introductory definition, but something
even shorter may be possible.
  
>  What is a posthuman?


I would list this as the second question and, again, vote in favor of the most
pointed and economical response.

I think the next questions should relate to the "unnatural" and "human nature"
issues, which go to the heart of what distinguishes transhumanism from other,
similar ideas and philosophies:

>  Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?
>  Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

Continuing the theme of definition by distinction, the following questions
follow naturally from the "nature" issues:

>  What makes transhumanism different from other philosophies, movements,
>  or religions?
>  
>  Isn't transhumanism old hat? Sure, it's a new name, but basically,
>  hasn't the philosophy been around a long time?

These actually may be conflated into a single question:

What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, and how is it
distinguished from other, similar ideas?

Having distinguished our ideas from those of other thinkers, we should
advertise our intellectual credentials:

>  What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism? (This is
>  not the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?")

An aside from this point (but one well worth addressing), is the "cult"
question sometimes encountered:

>  Is transhumanism a cult/religion?

I am less enamored of the following question:

>  Do you believe in God?

which, to maintain linguistic parallelism, should be rephrased as:

Do transhumanists believe in God?

I think anyone who is asking this question by this point has probably missed
the import of the material they would already have encountered in the FAQ.
Making this a separate question invites taking the answer to it out of context
its use in negative propaganda.  SO I would vote against inclusion of this
question.

I am more ambivalent about the following question:

>  There is a non-physical soul and therefore some transhumanist issues
>  are bound to fail (uploading, conscious AI)

First, I would rephrase it: 

Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because they can't preserve
or create the soul?

If folks want to include it, I'd like to have some input into the answer,
having had a lifetime of experience of memetic guerrilla warfare in the Bible
Belt.

The next questions all relate to "Life Extension" and should be grouped
together:
  
>  Why do you want to live longer?
>  
>  Isn't death part of the natural order of things?
>  
>  Won't extended lifespans cause overpopulation problems?

The next set of questions deal with social and political issues, and I would
group them together under a title indicating their common theme:

>  Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? What
>  happens to the rest?

>  Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the
>  condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,
>  instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?

>  What kind of society would posthumans live in?

>  These new technologies will be used in war and may cause our
>  extinction.

>  How will superintelligent machines treat us humans?

	(I would rephrase this as follows:
	How will posthumans or superintelligent machines 
	treat humans who aren't augmented?)

>  So you think technology will solve all problems?



The last set of questions relate to practicalities and progress in the
transhumanist program:

>  What evidence is there that it will happen?
 
>  What is nanotechnology?

>  All these transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years,
>  they will take more like a thousand years. (MNT, Uploading)
 
>  What if it doesn't work?

>  How could I become a posthuman?

>  The possibility of success (in cryonics) is too small.

>  Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?

>  What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?

The last question,

>  Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't
>  take it to heart)

I would rephrase in more positive terms:

How can I become involved in transhumanism?

Maybe not.  It is well documented that rats in an overcrowded cage start
producing more homosexual rats.  This seems to be a normal (genetic?)
reaction to over-population.  In the modern, over-populated world, it
would make sense that the same factors could kick in to slowdown human
over-population.  If this is the case, it may be the breeding population
that keeps increasing the population beyond sustainable levels who are
overriding the natural programming with memetic ideals.

I think you are probably correct.  What was interesting in the
statistics is that rate of gun use is up for murders and robberies but
is not up for assaults.  This may indicate that murders and robberies
are pre-planned with guns as the preferred weapons, while assaults are
more likely to be unplanned responses or outbursts.

The other trend I noticed on the rape statistics page, is that the
number of combined rapes and attempted rapes is about the same, but the
number of rapes is way up, and the number of attempted rapes is way
down.  Maybe this indicates that guns are much more successful in a rape
than other weapons?

Unfortunately, I don't think this or any other deterrent will work on
criminals or youth.  For any deterrent to work, the potential criminal
must weigh the chances of getting caught versus the chances of getting
away with it, and the costs of getting caught versus the costs of
getting away with it.

Criminals, especially young gang members, don't think this way, if they
think at all.  They act impulsively.  They react emotionally or out of
desperation.  They don't carefully plan their crime or weigh all their
options.  Even if they do consider their actions, they tend to overrate
their own abilities and underrate the abilities of authority figures.  I
have known some criminals and young gang-member types.  I don't think
any of them ever considered the possibility that they would get caught.

Lots of stuff going on here!

Here's what I do:

I work in Networking and Telecommunications, particularly in the field
of Data Security.  I have my own consulting practice, along with a
business partner, and have just agreed to provide my security consulting
services exclusively through IBM's security consulting practise.  I work
to protect data and to develop future techniques.  Although current use
of data networks may be of questionable transhuman worth, I think the
value of data and data protection to transhumanist interests will be
increasing in the future.

I also am the author of _The_Nutrients_Catalog_.  This was my attempt to
classify a lot of known nutritional data into a single useable reference
work.  It is meant to be a handbook of nutritional data.  It is not a
pep-talk, a defense of nutritional supplements, or a how-to book.

I am greatly interested in looking for more direct ways to bring about
future technology.  Maybe some of the different people on this list can
work together on some specific projects.

Half of the total information under consideration is gone.
It can easily be replaced, usually, but if for some reason
it could not, and you needed it, you might realize that 
the information you deleted was indeed a unique copy.

No.  I am trying to argue that there must be continuity of
consciousness to be sure that the uploaded one is the
actual original consciousness, instead of a consciousness
that was just created, while destroying the first.

I don't think I am.  What I meant is that consciousness
might not be as complex as we think.  OTOH, it might
required a structure which is not only very complex,
but has properties (e.g. consciousness) that cannot
be modeled separately from the structure.  That is,
you might need to simulate the entire structure to get
consciousness, instead of being able to abstract the
conscious being from the structure that produces it.

Yes, but it may be impossible to understand something
merely by reference to its parts.  That is, there may be
laws of the universe that do not act on simple structures.
I don't have any evidence, though, this is just whistling
in the dark.

I don't necessarily think that those are the only
choices.  Even if it can be shown that mere 
information processing is not enough for 
consciousness (as Penrose has tried and
failed to do, so far), we need not institute a 
"soul of the gaps", so to speak.

Yes, you mentioned this in "Zed", but I don't agree that
the entire brain is required.  Only specific memories are
required, those of you thinking about being conscious.

Well, if I could experience a memory of yours, then *that*

the memory, no?

It need not understand consciousness, only memory.
If I can reliably record and play back memories, then
I can play back one of *your* memories in *my* brain,

If someone with plastic surgery and a really

you politely to commit suicide, so he could

I disagree that it would work.  I could program
a present-day computer to give a specific 
answer to a specific question, specifically, the
answer I would give.  Would this computer then
be me, for the duration of the asking and 
answering?  It seems clear that it cannot be.
But I see no difference between this and the
20 or 40 year version, except in length of 
programming time.  

>>yet I am *still* not you. :)

>Why not? You're certainly not you anymore so you must be me.

Why can't I still be me, if I am only acting?  Are
you suggesting that an actor on television is
*really* the role, and no longer the actor?

Excerpts from an Associated Press report
about discovering a new "potent antioxidant."


Possible Stroke Drug Is Tested 

Monday, July 6, 1998; 1:24 p.m. EDT


WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal scientists have begun
testing in rats a chemical from marijuana that they 
say appears to protect brain cells during a stroke. 

``This is a better candidate'' against stroke than 
other marijuana chemicals, said Aiden Hampson of 
the National Institute of Mental Health. 

His study, published in this week's Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences, found that in a 
test tube, cannabidiol proved to be a potent anti-
oxidant that protected animal brain cells exposed 
to the toxic neurochemical that is produced during 
a stroke. 

Until now, cannabidiol had been considered an inactive
ingredient, Hampson said. It was studied as a possible 
drug for Huntington's disease a decade ago but failed 
to work. However, scientists who gave high doses to 
people at that time uncovered no serious side 
effects, he said.

Subject: [UPLOADING]  Is an exact duplicate "me"?
From: harv@gate.net (Harvey Newstrom)

Same old argument...

The scenario:
Someone makes an exact duplicate of me.  Nanites have made it a perfect
copy of me, atom per atom.  Even its brain, memories and thought
processes are identical to mine.  It thinks it is the original and will
probably act in any situation just like the original.

Is it "me"?  This is a semantical question based on the definition of
"me".  The question is probably unanswerable because there is no good
definition of "me".  Everyone currently has an unalterable viewpoint
from within a single body.  This viewpoint always defines the self.
When copies are made, there are multiple bodies with similar programs
running in them.  The concept of "me" no longer applies in the same way.
New definitions must be made.  The old definition does not apply.  So
the answer is probably that both of the resulting individuals are
equally "me"?

Is there any difference between the two individuals?  No.  Both are
functionally the same.  Neither the copy or the original can tell the
difference.  No one else can tell the difference.  If the original were
killed and they copy continued in its place, the result would be the
same as if the original had continued.  I think everyone agree with
this(?).

Is there any rationale for killing one over the other?  No.  They are
identical in every way, including memories and thought processes.  The
idea that the original has more of a right to live or claim the identity
of "me" than the copy does not make sense and cannot be proven or
distinguished between the two individuals.

Would either individual agree to commit suicide based on the fact that
the other would continue in its place?  I say no.  Others would say yes.
I have a deeply personal desire to live and to continue on forever.  I'm
not sure why I feel this way.  It may be based more on fear of death
than anything else.  I do *not* think it is based on an altruistic
desire to provide some functional usefulness to the rest of the
universe.  Just because a replacement has been found who can do the job
of "me" just as well, that does not mean that I want to quit my job of
being "me".  I still would be a functional individual.  After the
copying process produces two individuals that think as "me", I believe
both of them would continue to hold this belief.  Both would equally try
to avoid death, and would probably mourn the loss of the other.

Is death a personal loss, or a loss to others?  Some would allow one of
the copies to be killed based on the theory that the other can replace
it.  However, this implies that the value of a life is not based on the
individual's value upon their own life, but upon the value that life
contributes to others.  If an exact copy can contribute to others in an
identical manner, then the original can be killed with no loss to
others.  But the individual may not want to be killed.  The individual
would be alive, experiencing life, and might not want that experience to
end.  Is the "life" to be measured from the individual's point of view,
or from the point of view of others?

Would my stream of consciousness somehow jump from the original to the
copy when the original is destroyed?  I see no scientific basis for
this.  The two are separate individuals with no mystical connection.
When one ceases to function, it no longer continues.  Just because
another replacement can predict what the dead copy would do next does
not mean that the dead copy is not dead.  After the copying, there are
two people, no matter how similar.  After one is killed, there is one
living person and one dead body.  I can see no rationale for saying that
the body is not dead or that the person has not been killed just because
there is a suitable replacement for the one who was killed.  Before the
killing there were two persons with my qualifications who can perform
work.  After the killing, there is one less such persons.

Conclusion from all this rambling:  I don't want to avoid death based on
what I can contribute to others.  I don't even try to justify my
contribution to the universe as a justification for my continued
existence.  I want to continue living because it's fun, because I like
experiencing things, and because I fear having input to my experience
simply cease.  Having an exact duplicate of myself does not change my
feeling.  I think we need a better definition of why we want to live at
all.  For those who only live to be functionally useful, they may not
mind dying if a perfect replacement is found or made.  For those who
just want to experience life, I don't think any substitute for personal
growth and survival would be acceptable.

Am I replying to my own post, or am I copy replying to another copy's
post?  Anyway...

I'm inside this body.  This is me.  Even if an exact copy is made, I'm
still inside this body.  I don't want this vessel containing me
destroyed, because I'm still in here.  An exact copy of me may appear to
everyone else to be the same as me, but I will never perceive it to be
me.  I will always perceive myself within this body.  It does not matter
if I am the original or a copy, I perceive myself inside this vessel,
and don't want this vessel destroyed.  I don't see how identical copies
of me changes this.  Any copy of me feels the same way.  It perceives
itself to be itself.  It would not want its body destroyed because it is
still inside it's body.  It doesn't matter how many copies are in
existance, each individual within its own mind and body would not want
its body destroyed and its mind functioning to cease.

Yep. I've also emailed to the WTA-associates list telling people who 
are interested to join the extropian or the transhumanist mailing 
list. 

I will be listening in for a couple of days for comments on the 
questions and then post the first part of the revised set.

"Diet and Risk of Clinical Diabetes in Women"
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 55: 1018-1023 1992

Abstract:

   To determine the relations of diet with risk of clinical
noninsulin-dependent diabetes, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort
of 84,360 US women. During 6 y of follow-up we identified 702 definite
incident cases. Because body mass index (BMI) is a powerful risk factor for
diabetes, we examined the relations of fat (including type), fiber,
sucrose, and other components of diet to risk of diabetes, among women with
BMIs (in kg/m2) < 29 kg/m2. After controlling for body mass index, previous
weight change, and alcohol intake, we observed no associations between
intakes of energy, protein, sucrose, carbohydrate, or fiber and risk of
diabetes. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted
intake, the relative risks (and tests for trend) for those in the highest
quintile were 0.61 (P trend = 0.03) for vegetable fat, 0.62 (P trend =
0.008) for potassium, 0.70 (P trend = 0.005) for calcium, and 0.68 (P trend
= 0.02) for magnesium. These inverse associations were attenuated among
obese women (BMIs >= 29).

Additional quote from text:

  "We also examined specific foods in relation to risk of diabetes among
women with a body mass index < 29. We added each of the 61 food items to a
model that included body mass index, alcohol intake, energy intake, and
prior weight change; we observed that many items were significantly related
to risk. Skim milk, cabbage, carrots, homemade pie, cake, dark bread,
peanut butter, and wine were each inversely related to risk. Whole milk,
yogurt, processed meats, eggs, cola, noncarbonated beverages, home-fried
food, white bread, potato chips, rice and pasta, and French fries were each
positively related to risk.
  To examine associations for fruit and vegetables, we summed the daily
intake of reported intakes for fruits, vegetables, and fruit and vegetables
combined. Among women with a body mass index < 29, intake of vegetables was
inversely related to risk of diabetes, but intake of fruit was not related
to risk."

Additional comment by poster:

  The effect of glycemic index (GI) on diabetes was not separately examined
in this study. The reason why vegetables, but not fruit are associated with
reduced risk, may be because vegetables, but not fruit are often consumed
with the major meals. Although most vegetables have high GIs themselves, it
has been found that addition of vegetables such as carrots to a large meal
lowers the GI of the entire meal. (European Journal of Clinical Nutrition
48: 386-396 1994)

Yes.  As I grouped (and partially rephrased) them, the questions would look
like this:

GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSHUMANISM

What is transhumanism?

What is a posthuman?

Transhumanism and Nature

Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

TRANSHUMANISM AS A PHILOSOPHICAL AND CULTURAL VIEWPOINT

What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, 
and how is it distinguished from other, similar ideas?

What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?

	An alternative to living longer, or even immortal is to live on "longer
than life", or "immortally".

	I've always wanted to (and still do) accomplish something in life that
will make myself or my work
	known, for a long period of time.  Of course, the idea is that I'll be
doing something that most people
	would not have thought of to do, that would have a positive enough impact
on a large enough group
	of people that I would not be forgotten, or atleast my influence would not
cease when I die.  I do not
	wish to become like the masses, content to be born, occupy resources, and
die.  

	Is this an extropian-like belief ?, or is this just something that I sense
a lot of people here might
	share?.  And I'm not looking at this from the "I must have my name known"
point of view - I'm looking

Well, this is true, but  my point was that there is an awful lot
that humans do to apes which is most definately not simply
ignoring them, namely experimenting on them and chopping down
their habitat. Your point on the PR value of animals is entirely
true, but the experimentation issue is something most people
don't consider.

Suppose you are an upload.  Someone proposes to pause your program for
a moment, then resume it.  Will this kill you?  (Note that such behavior
is an inherent property of timesharing computer systems, and that in fact
the discrete nature of computer simulations implies that there can be
said to be a "pause" between each clock tick.)

Someone proposes to pause your program and then resume it on another
machine.  Will this kill you?  (Note that such behavior is an inherent
property of load-balancing multi-processor systems.)

Suppose the computer has redundancy internally so that everything is
duplicated, two copies of each processor side by side, likewise for memory
elements, communication circuits, etc.  You are run on such a computer.
Someone proposes to remove some element of the redundancy so that
there will no longer be this internal duplication.  Will this kill you?

Suppose the two copies are run on two different computers.  They are in
perfect synchrony and all signals on one are duplicated on another.  This
is another way of providing redundancy.  Someone proposes to turn off
one of the computers permanently.  Will this kill you?

The last scenario seems essentially to represent the situation you describe
where you would view it as commiting suicide.  I have tried to set up a
chain of situations where the first is clearly not a matter of dying,
and where there is a relatively small change between each step in the
chain.  Presumably you will draw a line somewhere and say, this step does
not kill me but the next one will.  This may help to clarify what the
elements are which seem important to you as part of your identity and
which you want to preserve in order to "stay alive".

A possible additional spin on this type of question is whether 
transhumanism is environmentally sound, or if they might be dangerous:

Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?

Might transhuman technologies be dangerous?

This second question can be answered with specifics; many of the other 
FAQs deal with such specifics, which need not be reiterated in the 
answer. However, it can also be answered at the level of 
generalities: "Well, yes, transhuman technologies may be dangerous, 
just as cars, aeroplanes, and electrical power can be dangerous. 
However, ..."

I would like to reiterate a point that has dropped off this question: it 
is not at all the same as "Who is prominent within transhumanism?", 
although that is also an interesting question.

This is the sort of question which makes me think that more than one 
answer ought to be given to several of these FAQs.  Readers can decide 
for themselves which answer to take more seriously. Similarly for the 
next question:
  
> What if it doesn't work?

A very nice set of questions.  Unfortunately, an FAQ has certain stylistic 
disadvantages over an essay; its disjointed form typically means that 
fewer people will read it all the way through than would read a 
well-written essay.  An essay inspired by the FAQ may be a useful 
project for inclusion in the transhumanist reader.

This is my thinking on the matter. The only time anyone pulled a

The problem, and I thought that was why you were writing the
post, is that guns and gun-control take up a disproportionate
amount of time on this list, and were someone to read it for a
while they may well wind up with a distorted view of what
extropianism is about. Or not.

Yesterday's speakers and exhibition at UCLA Dickerson Art Center on "Art &
Aesthetics of Artificial Life" was spot on!  For a small exhibition, it was
quality, to be sure.  And, in this instance size didn't count.  It was one
day, about 11 speakers and only two small rooms of visuals, 3D and 2D.  It
was a jewel of a show.  

A speaker that whose talk I enjoyed very much was mathematician Stewart
Dickson (Disney), who displayed algorithmic sculpture by first showing a
mathematical equation on a blackboard, then holding up the 3D image (and
also with a braille texture so you could "feel" the equation).  His own
frustration with the "inherent flatness of two-dimensional displays spurred
him to turn to sculpture and to new technologies for creating models of
mathematical forms in their three-dimensional splendor."  He uses a
software system known as Mathematica and the new technology of
stereolitholgraphy, which allows the designer to sculpt a plastic rendition
of the equation and.  Its called Plastic Math.  (Ballistics particle
manufacturing is another technology.)

Also Charles Ostman (Mondo, SFSU) exhibited his growing art as a
combination of synthetic sentience, nanotechnology, biochip, and digital
biota.  The visuals were beautiful to look at.  I enjoyed his presentation
very much because it was jam packed with images and scientific language.  A
real confluence of art and science.

Other speakers who I was unable to meet where Yachiro Kawaguchi and Steven
Rook who discussed the artform of utilizing computational processes which
mimic the physiologies of living organisms and systems as a methodology for
"discovering" aesthetics content. 

(Some other exhibitors who were not invited speakers were H.R. Giger, Karl
Simms, Una May O'Reilly, Mamou Oshie, and others.)

I was delighted when Gary Zebington of Merlin in Australia (Stelarc)
recognized me and introduced himself.  (He is a charter signee of the
Extropic Art Manifesto.) 

Anyway, it was an exceptional show, and I'm really sorry that I missed
Sarita Thakoor (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) who talked about 1st NASA/JPL
Workshop on Biomorphic Explores for Future missions to Mars.

I think there are a couple of errors here:

1.  An increase in gay rats does not slow down the population bloom, as
non-gay rats are always happy to take up the slack.

2.  If these gay rats are not contributing to the gene pool, their trait
can not be said to have evolved for this purpose (it may be a "glitch",
which evolved for some other purpose but turns fatal in an over-populated
environment).

In humans, the "gay gene" exists in an equilibrium with those of other
sexual stratedgies, increasing its share in small societies where the
increased disease risk that this strategy brings is not a large factor,
decreasing when the opposite is true.  Presumedly something similar is
going on with the rats....

Passing the Turing Test seems to me to be a sufficient (though not 
necessary) condition for intelligence.  If a machine can jump through 
all the hoops which I am able to conure up, then I would consider it to 
be  intelligent; indeed, much more so than the average human being.

This, of course, is not meant as a scientific test for intelligence.  It 
is a sociological test for intelligence, which is apt, because the word 
"intelligence" as it is normally used has more sociological meaning 
than scientific.  In particular, we say that someone is "very bright" 
if they seem able to jump through all the intellectual hoops which 
we've seen them encounter in everyday life.

I've generally been very disappointed in books I've read that are 
specifically about artificial intelligence.  This includes Penrose's 
first book, which was terrific when he wasn't talking about 
intelligence, and pretty bad when he was.  "Goedel, Escher, Bach" was 
pretty good.

Only two books spring to mind as being especially worthwhile reads among 
the books I've read on the subject:

Minsky's "Society of Mind" (1985) had a considerable influence on the  
way my thinking has developed.  However, I read it as an   
impressionable, none-to-critical twelve year old, so I'm not sure how  
it has dated.  Definitely worth a look.

Ray Kurzweil's "The Age of Intelligent Machines" (1990?) was a good
read.  A little dated now, it still contains a considerable amount of 
useful information, and some thought-provoking points.

I've "read", to varying degrees, a couple of dozen other books which are 
either directly about AI, or which touch on it as a major theme.  Even the 
worst manage to stimulate some thoughts, but I recommend 
shorter essays or sf novels as being just as stimulating.  Daniel 
Dennett seems to be entertaining and thought-provoking, although I haven't 
read much of his material.

That would be useful. One of the advantages of (two-way) hypertext is 
that these essays could stand on their own, while still being an integral 
part of a >H FAQ.

I think that FAQ pertaining to "culture" should be its own category with
Transhumanist Art, and the various genre's of this period.  Please keep in
mind with this that Transhumanist Art is of the modes of transhuman
creative innovations and openly is the only art period that represents the
confluence of art and science.

Thus, I would not include culture with philosophy, but culture and the
arts.  This is in part due to historical reasons (art and culture are
recognized to go hand in hand by traditionally, making it easier for
newcomers); and my own views that art influences culture and vice versa.  

"Transhumanist Art and Transhuman Culture"

This would possibly include the FAQ on the Transhumanist Art web site, as
well as questions about augmenting creativity, automorphing (ourselves: our
behavior, bodies, and A-Life).  I would keep it simple, but would not leave
out what is important in explaining it cogently.

>From what I understand, prenatal stress during certain fetal critical 
periods can cause the mother's hormonal levels and ratios to 
fluctuate, resulting in an increased likelihood of homosexual 
orientation in the child.  This makes evolutionary sense; if the 
environment is hostile enough to cause hardship-induced stress to 
the mother, it is likely (the rule - though periodically broken - being 
environmental inertia) to be rough on succeeding generations.  
Individuals who would not have children of their own and could 
therefore devote resources to the well-being of their siblings' 
children would help sustain a genetic line through these times; when 
the environment improved and stress dscreased, so would the 
homosexual percentage of the population.  I believe a study was 
done in Germany with children born in and immediately after the W 
W II period.

I dunno...but I kinda think the answer is "YES".

The reason being is that another list has been formed for the "serious"
stuff...and this is now the "training wheels" list...where anything and
everything is acceptable...

I think...I could very well be wrong.

But I for one would welcome discussion/debate about first principles..

Further to someone's point eariler that there are two points of view 
involved here, mine and my double's:

Is it meaningful to speak of two POV's when we have two, carefully 
synchronized virtual worlds happening here?

>From my POV (as the virtual person who is not being deleted) I would 
have no problem, since I maintain continuity of experience.

>From the POV of the deleted-me, I'm not certain. It seems to me there is 
a difference between death and lack of continuity of experience.

Part of the difference here is with the idea of discrete clock ticks. If 
I were to cease to exist between "clock-ticks" of the universe, then by 
definition, I would never know. It would be like turning off the lights.

I feel, intuitively, that erasing one's percieved existence may be on a 
different moral level then murder. Again, lack of continuity of 
experience is not the same as death.

Why do I get the distinct feeling I'm defending this really badly? :)

Well taking this argument to the extreme we ought to give everybody their

I am not trying to argue pro or con Gun. I'm just saying it's taking up to
much space on this list.

Well the thing is that nobody I know of considder guns to be a big problem!
Me neither. Because there is practically no murders comitted with guns here.

Guns is a special issue as it can be very provoking to many Europeans.

>I was under the impression that several Scandinavian countries had militias
>who kept automatic weapons at home?


Oh yeas we do. All of the Scandinavian countries has a national guard. I
have myself been a member of the Danish National guard for more than ten
years. During wich time I have had several Weapons in my home (only one type
at the time though). M75, M62, M49 and an LMG. All with live ammo as we had
24 hours to repport to duty in case of a hostile situation.

There are 75,000 Danes with millitary weapons in their homes. The weapons
are missused only 1-2 times a year due to high safety standards.

I am NOT an anti gun Weanie with no knowlegde of weapons. I am highly
trained in most millitary small arms.

I am only trying to say that the gun debate takes up to much place on this
list. And I am pretty shure that when it's a turn-off for me, it is even
more so for most Europeans. That is bad PR.

That's a cheapshot comment that I cannot see has anything to do with the gun
discussions on this list. I'm not even shure the statistics are correct.
Furthermore I am not arguing that the Danish socialist political system is
the best. Far from. I just happen to live here.

We Europeans.

Freedom-loving Americans on this list (yeah, yeah, sounds like some
bs propaganda, but they *do* love freedom, which includes the right
to keep and bear arms, and they *are* Americans -- hence freedom-
loving Americans).

The point is that it is rather strange that people who deeply dislike
guns because they're "dangerous killing machines", think so positively
of the future, which will deliver powerful tools of (mass) destruction 
into the hands of more people than ever before.

	Does anyone know of any COMPLETE theories on how the concept of having an

  well...what come to my mind directly is the 1980 nasa's lunar base
project
perhaps you can take a look at that :

http://lslwww.epfl.ch/~moshes/selfrep/    (artificial self replication
page)

there is for sure other interresting sources....

Yes.  You would be killing me and then unkilling me.  Suspending my
program by pausing it is similar to the idea behind cryonics.  When I
die, deanimate, or cease to function, I will be suspended.  Hopefully,
someone will later reanimate or unsuspend me.  That is what you are
doing here:  You are suspending and then unsuspending the program.

As with cryonics, if I am unsuspended at some point in the future, I
would consider myself alive.  If I am never unsuspended, and my remains
deteriorate, then I would consider myself dead.

I don't mind these theoretical pauses between ticks.  What I mind is
having myself stopped while the rest of the universe goes on without me.
If I am stopping/starting at the same rate as the rest of the universe,
then I will continue to experience life in real-time with no gaps or
loss of experience.

> Someone proposes to pause your program and then resume it on another
> machine.  Will this kill you?

I don't know.  This is the same question we are considering now.  You
really can't pause and unpause a program to a different processor.  You
must kill the first program, load a copy into the second program, start
the second program and then kill the original.  What you are asking is
the same as the original question.

By using uploaded programs in your example, you are removing normal
human life from the process.  It is pretty obvious when a human is and
isn't functioning.  Programs start and stop all the time.  Copies of
them are run here and there.  Are they the same program, different
instances of the same program, or different programs?  These are
semantic questions as to what is "sameness".  I would not be willing to
let a program running my consciousness be terminated, even if a copy of
it were to be started somewhere else.  The choice to kill my program is
based on my program alone.  I don't care what other programs are also
running, my program does not want to be killed.

Semantics again.  There are two copies of me running.  If you kill one,
it will die and there will only be one copy of me left running.  Ask the
identical copies which process should be killed, and I think they will
give the identical answer:  Kill the other one!

Same as above.  You are postulating two of me.  I have 2x processing
power and am located in two distinct locations.  If you kill one of me,
I have lost a full person's worth of processing power, one person's
amount of disk space, one person's cpu chip.  My ability to experience
consciousness in the terminated location has stopped.  The loss is
identical to the killing of a single instance of me.  A person watching
the one computer get killed will not be able to detect any difference
between your example and a simple killing of the single entity known as
me.  The fact that miles away there is some other program running does
not change the events for the one computer a bit.

> The last scenario seems essentially to represent the situation you describe
> where you would view it as committing suicide.

I agree.  This scenario is the same as my suicide question.  That's why
my answer is the same.  You probably expected my answer to be different,
but I'm not sure why.

What is it about the copy that makes me lose my will to live?  Is it the
knowledge that I will have left my mark on society?  I don't care about
leaving a mark, I care about continuing to live.  Is it that the copy
can do anything I can do, so I am no longer unique?  I don't care.  My
desire to live is not dependent on being unique.  I will not be so
depressed upon seeing a copy that I kill myself.  Is it that the copy
can predict what I will do, and therefore I don't have to do it?  Is it
that no one else could tell the difference, and if no one else cares,
why should I care either?  What information makes me change my mind
about wanting to live?

Theres also an article in an issue of Discovery which talks about self
replicating robots in the Sahara desert, which create an endless amount of
solar panels out of the elements in the sand, including chips, metal railings,
factories, furnaces etc...  It also said that the technology for this is
currently available and would supply the whole world with power in a few
years, only taking up the size of the state of Arizona, I'm not sure how much
it would have costed, prolly cheaper now (article I read was 3 years ago), but
definately accomplishable if we really wanted to do it (I think they said
between 1 and 100 billion dollars).  If its global every country could
contribute who wanted a part of it, it would become free to the consumer.
Plausible free energy, does anyone have more information on this?
Specifically the Sahara desert project?  We need to start this project soon,
what is stopping us?

There is no "slack".  We are talking about overcrowded rats.  I know of
no mechanism for an gay rats to trigger increased breeding in other
rats.  It would be very interesting to discover a nonbreeding influence
on the subsequent generation!

Your assuming that all rats passing along the gay gene are themselves
gay.  Most genes are not simple dominant genes that express themselves
in their hosts.  This is why children can have traits not visible in
their parents, even though they were passed genetically from the
parents.

If there is a "gay gene", I'm not sure why you think it would be more
likely to be regulated by disease that any other gene.  I don't think
there are any gay-specific diseases.  HIV is too recent to be proposed
as a disease factor in evolution, and its incubation time is much too
long to prevent breeding.  Since gays don't reproduce as much as
nongays, I would expect a gay-preferring disease to have little effect
on genetics.

But these two virtual worlds are about to diverge.  One virtual
experience ends in death.  The other virtual experience continues
indefinitely.  Which of these different experiences will you choose?
The two programs are going to execute radially different commands very
shortly.

Is a "Star Trek future" a future where humans roughly equivlaant to today's
humans in intelligence live in a world full of extemely high technology? If so
I consider it a fantasy. A Star Trek level of technology is far more than
sufficient to permit massive intelligence augmentation. There is no reason
to believe the resulting intelligences will live as humans do.

Given a choice, I would of course choose to continue to exist. Both of 
"us" would. The point I was trying (inexpertly) to make, was that the 
shutting off of an emulation is neither morally nor practically 
equivalent to "death". It's something deeper. Maybe more to be feared, 
maybe less, but certainly different. From the point of view of a virtual 
being that knew it was going to be deactivated, I would be less anxious 
then I would be over impending physical "death" within the context of a 
continuing virtual world. Perhaps it's a hind-brain egoistic bias, or 
the fact that an instantaneous shutdown promises A) lack of pain, B) 
lack of perception/comprehension, and C) a promise of at least potential 
resumption of processing.

In answer to Mr. Finney's question, No, I do not believe that having 
one's universe-process suspended counts as death. Facetiuosly, prove 
that your universe-process hasn't been suspended for better then 200 
(years?) between the moment you opened this email and when you started 
reading it.

Indeed, Some episodes of Star Trek, The Next Generation actially HAD

They threw it away, and never mentioned it again.

Perhaps true, perhaps not, it's irrelevant. Consciousness is obviously  
subjective so even if I stopped all your brain activity for a billion years 
and then restarted it there is no way you could tell internally, you could 
detect no gaps without observing the  outside world, so your consciousness 
would be continuous.
              
        >you might need to simulate the entire structure to get consciousness 
          

Then simulate the mind, although "simulate" is not really the correct word 
when dealing with information, a calculator doesn't perform simulated 
arithmetic.

Interesting theory, but as we're talking about consciousness not intelligence

Books, music or a painting, give me a different subjective experience than 
these exact same things give you (I think), sometimes very different (I think) 
so why would you expect my memories to effect you the same way they do me?

There is an even deeper problem, the only reason I think the 6 year old  
John Clark is not dead, at least not entirely dead, is that I remember being 
him, if technology advances to the point (and it will) where you can really 
remember being me then you are  me, and Randall R Randall still has no idea 
what it's like to be John Clark.

HELL NO, my momma didn't raise no dummies! The situation is not symmetrical 
because the two act differently, one asks the other to sacrifice himself but  
the other asks no such thing, so the two "copies" can not be anywhere close  
to being identical. Let me propose a thought experiment of my own.

An exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, is created 
a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of 
feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non linear effects 
would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big 
differences, but this is a thought experiment so who cares. In the first two
cases below the results would vary according to personalities, remember 
there's a lot of illogic even in the best of us.
             
1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my head 
   and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am I concerned? 
   You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an identical gun 
   to the head of my double and making an identical threat.
             
2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds will 
   diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my double will 
   be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, in times of intense 
   stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because I am 
   going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd be looking 
   at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes off and 
   if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy 
   was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering why I 
   get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness of it all. 
   My (semi) double would be thinking "it's a shame about that other fellow 
   but I'm glad it's not me".
             
3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads and 
   we both are convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, making a hell 
   of a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires. In this 
   case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience I am 
   completely unharmed. The real beauty part is that I don't even have to  
   clean up the mess.
             
The bottom line is we don't have thoughts and emotions, we are thoughts and 
emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that is rendering them 
changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the meaning of your 
post different from what it was on yours.

This should send drug warriors into conniption fits,
THC (the active chemical in cannabis) is found to 
be a brain-damage- preventing  antioxidant. Anti-
oxidants extend the life of cells. As a National 
Academy of Sciences publication just reported:

 "Cannabidiol and THC also were shown to prevent 
 hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well 
 as or better than other antioxidants..."

Here's the abstract of these research findings:

http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/95/14/8268 


Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

Vol. 95, Issue 14, 8268-8273, July 7, 1998


Cannabidiol and (delta)9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
are neuroprotective antioxidants 

A. J. Hampson, M. Grimaldi, J. Axelrod, and D. Wink

Contributed by Julius Axelrod, April 27, 1998 

The neuroprotective actions of cannabidiol and other 
cannabinoids were examined in rat cortical neuron cultures 
exposed to toxic levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter 
glutamate. Glutamate toxicity was reduced by both cannabidiol, 
a nonpsychoactive constituent of marijuana, and the 
psychotropic cannabinoid (delta)9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 

Cannabinoids protected equally well against neurotoxicity 
mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, 2-amino-3-
(4-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)propionic acid receptors, 
or kainate receptors. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-induced 
toxicity has been shown to be calcium dependent; this study 
demonstrates that 2-amino-3-(4-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)
propionic acid/kainate receptor-type neurotoxicity is also 
calcium-dependent, partly mediated by voltage sensitive 
calcium channels. 

The neuroprotection observed with cannabidiol and THC was 
unaffected by cannabinoid receptor antagonist, indicating 
it to be cannabinoid receptor independent. Previous studies 
have shown that glutamate toxicity may be prevented by 
antioxidants. Cannabidiol, THC and several synthetic 
cannabinoids all were demonstrated to be antioxidants by 
cyclic voltametry. Cannabidiol and THC also were shown to 
prevent hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well as 
or better than other antioxidants in a chemical (Fenton 
reaction) system and neuronal cultures. Cannabidiol was 
more protective against glutamate neurotoxicity than 
either ascorbate or -tocopherol, indicating it to be a 
potent antioxidant. These data also suggest that the 
naturally occurring, nonpsychotropic cannabinoid, 
cannabidiol, may be a potentially useful therapeutic 
agent for the treatment of oxidative neurological 
disorders such as cerebral ischemia.

The more common effect of stress on human females during pregnancy is
miscarriage.  I find it hard to believe the scenario you suggest could have
evolved: if resources are plentiful enough that a woman can afford to raise
a dud kid, why not raise a loaded one instead?  Same cost.  If things are
so tight she can't afford to raise a kid, raising a kid to help out isn't a
viable alternative.  Seems bogus to me.  Hard to apply to the gay rats, as
well.

Pray dust off this half-century old study and reveal the identity of the
authors, so I can laugh at them....

Suppose we take some intermediate case, such as being an upload on a
relatively slow computer.  Are you dead then?  Is there some threshold
of speed such that you are literally dead if the computer runs slower
than that, because the rest of the universe is going on without you,
while you are still alive if the computer runs faster?

Can you imagine discovering that you are running on a timesharing computer
and there are occasional delays of up to 1 millisecond during which
you are suspended?  Would you then view yourself as constantly dying
and being reborn?  Does this frighten you and activate your instincts
which fear death?

I want to emphasize here that we are not arguing any semantic issues about
sameness or anything else.  All I want to know is whether the scenarios
frighten you and make you fear that you will die.  Would you be afraid
to run on a multiprocessor system because you know that it would switch
you among its internal processors, even though the switching would be
undetectable to you?  If you found that you were running on such a system,
would you conclude that you were constantly dying and being reborn, and
feel alarmed and upset as a result?

What if it were discovered that the human brain occasionally switches among
its neurons, letting some neurons rest and using other nearby neurons
while those first ones recover.  Would you conclude that you are constantly
dying, because the site of processing in your brain is constantly shifting
around and not staying with the same set of neurons?

What if the redundancy is obtained by using double-thick wires and
double-sized transistors in the circuit design?  Now someone proposes
to save costs by shaving away half of this circuitry, while leaving the
logic alone.  Would this bother you?

Suppose this thick circuitry has a line dividing it which can be switched
between electronically insulating and conducting states.  In one state
it is conducting and we have the thick-wire case.  In the other state it
is insulating and we have the divided-processor case.  In each state the
electric flow on both sides of the line is exactly the same, so no
actual electrons ever need to cross the line (although they may drift
across due to thermal noise).

Does the conductivity state of this divider change your answer when
someone asks whether they can cut away the left half of each wire?

I appreciate you taking the time to attempt to answer these rather
exotic thought experiments.  My instinct is that the nature of electronic
circuits is such that the notion of "how many circuits" there are is not
well defined, yet it appears to be central to your idea of identity.
That is why I am trying to suggest these various examples where it
becomes questionable how many instances of a given computational process
there are.

The remaining, non-gay male rats would surely be up to the task of keeping
the females supplied with sperm, no?  I suspect they would even take on
this onerous duty with some enthusiasm....  So having gay rats in the rat
pool would not help to lessen the population crunch.

If I remember correctly, the topic was rats having evolved a trait that
causes them to turn gay when overpopulation sets in.  So at some point in
time there is a hero rat who, due to a mysterious mutant strain in his
makeup, turns gay to save the colony from their population crises.  Which
effort fails miserably (see #1 above).  This heroic rat then, for his
second act, refrains from having any descendants to carry on his heroic
tradition....

I think it's fair to say that if this trait offers no reproductive
advantage in this scenario, it didn't evolve in this scenario, or *for this
purpose*.

To take your last statement first, people with the "gay gene" have
historically reproduced just as often as people without it, else this gene
would have declined and vanished from the gene pool.

By trying to "fit in" to societies that expected men to marry and have
children, gays did indeed father children--as often as straights.  Which
explains why disease was a limiting factor for this trait: since gays were
having sex with other men as well as with women, they had more sex partners
than straight males, hence they suffered disproportionately from STD's.

It is supposed that the "having more sex partners" is also the reproductive
advantage offered by this gene, as possessors of it tend to gain more and
earlier sexual experience than those who lack it, which is much appreciated
by the girlies....

Well from my point of view it is them who has an image problem. That was one

Well thats pretty simple. Guns in the hands of the criminal and the weak
minded is a problem now. Hence it should be adressed now. The other
_possible_ threats wil have to be dealed with when they become a real.

Unless there are direct comments to me I will stop answering to the gun
debate. Apparantly that is the only way to improve the S/N ratio in that
regard.

As far as I know, the closest thing is the work on "auxons",
replicating robots building solar panels, by Klaus Lackner and
Christopher Wendt. See
http://magazines.enews.com/magazines/discover/magtxt/100195-5.html

Since this work is largely theoretical, and we need to learn much more
to make robots and AI that works well in the real, physical world in a
robust and flexible fashion, I think it is safe to say that there are
no complete theories on how to do an automatic workforce. Still, the
goal doesn't look that far off; assuming we get better at robotics,
management of distributed agent systems and self-replication, then
the workforce idea begins to become reasonable.

Something you might want to consider is allowing people to vote
on when they think a future development is likely to occur. 
After a while, you'd have something which, while unlikely to be
accurate, might give you  a good feel of how
optimistic/pessimistic people are about the likelihood of
differing technological advances.

Well, hey, I think star ?rek is a remarkably crappy program, so
I'm not saying we should live in a strictly "Star Trek" world. 

What I am, of course, referring to is the abolition of work, and
the transformation of man into homo ludens, with or without
transhuman development. With transhumanism would be great,
without is still fine by me.

So, what's the relevance of the 15-24 age group and the definition of
"self-inflicted injury"? When's a suicide not a "self-inflicted injury"?

The only overall suicide rate comparison data I can find is at:

   http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/Suter/med-lit/g10.gif

Unfortunately for some reason my machine can't connect at this moment
to get precise figures. The data seems to put the US well below many 
European countries; oddly, Denmark was particularly bad.

Unfortunately that data is nearly a decade old, but those you gave aren't
much better. I know there are more up-to-date figures on the Web somewhere
but I didn't bookmark the page and AltaVista can't find it.

This is apparently where I differ with many,

It may depend on which one I am, or if

Same as above.

I disagree.  Even this last scenario implies that

Unfortunately, much of *my* discomfort with
this lies in my ignorance of how consciousness
works.  I think if we understood it, I'd be able to
delineate exactly where the problem lies.
I do not think that it is likely that we *will* fully
understand consciousness before the first
uploads, however, so I will be satisfied if
during the upload, the uploadee is fully
conscious at all times, and at no point in
the upload are there two complete copies
of the uploadee.  That is, a neuron by 
neuron upload, while conscious, would be
fine, I think.

Reasonably... i.e. about as good as any other international comparisons.
There's always an incentive to record suicides as accidents, and evidence
that a fair number of supposed gun accidents in America were really 
suicides; but even then there are comparitively so few reported gun 
accidents that adding them all to the suicide rate wouldn't affect it 
that much.

There are also other oddities, such as Japan where there's evidence of
many family murders (e.g. parents killing children then themselves)
being classified as suicides.

But it's not likely to affect the figures that much either way.

It's nothing of the kind; if we're concerned with saving lives and there's
a strong correlation between lack of freedom and suicide rates, then any
attempt to reduce the number of murders by creating massive police states
is going to increase the death rate even if it succeeds at reducing the
number of murders.

According to those WHO figures the suicide rate in Denmark was almost
three times as high as the US, and four times as high as the US murder
rate. So a Dane was four times as likely to kill themselves as an American
to be murdered, and about twice as likely to die a violent death (either 
murder or suicide) as an American. Other Scandinavian countries were 
not far behind.

Doesn't this disturb you? That Danes hate their lives so much that
they're three times as likely to kill themselves as Americans?

But when have anti-gun laws ever affected criminal access to guns? I haven't
seen a single documented example of removing guns from the hands of the
law-abiding preventing criminals getting them; the Danish government can't 
even keep anti-tank missiles out of the hands of the biker gangs, and a
BATF survey some time ago discovered that around 30% of all illegal guns
siezed in DC were previously stolen from police evidence rooms. If the 
cops are selling guns to criminals, what chance does any law have to 
succeed?

Certainly in Britain the number of violent crimes committed with guns has
increased vastly since the first anti-gun laws, and illegal guns are often
cheaper than the few varieties which are still legal. Violent criminals
are such a small minority of the population that it takes very few guns
to fulfill their needs.

John Heritage <xebec@home.com> asked about the negative resistance
article which expired off the www.buffalo.edu news server at <URL:

copy so I though't I'd post it and get it in the list archive.

             SUPERCONDUCTION AT ROOM TEMPERATURE:
             NEGATIVE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SEEN IN
             CARBON COMPOSITES 

             LAS VEGAS -- Materials engineers at the University at
             Buffalo have made two discoveries that have enabled
             carbon-fiber materials to superconduct at room temperature. 

             The related discoveries were so unexpected that the researchers
             at first thought that they were mistaken. 

             Led by Deborah D.L. Chung, Ph.D., UB professor of mechanical
             and aerospace engineering, the engineers observed negative
             electrical resistance in carbon-composite materials, and zero
             resistance when these materials were combined with others that
             are conventional, positive resistors. 

             Their observation of zero resistance is the first time that this has
             been seen without cooling. Zero resistance has been seen in
             superconducting materials, but only at temperatures of 125
             degrees Kelvin, about -150 degrees Centigrade or -234 degrees
             Fahrenheit. 

             Without resistance, there is no energy loss, so the amount of
             energy that is put into a system is exactly the amount that it
             produces. 

             According to the researchers, the discovery has the potential to
             lead to much faster, far- more-efficient electronic devices,
             previously assumed to be possible only with the development of
             room-temperature superconductors. Potential applications
             include much-simpler, more-powerful electronic circuits in
             computers and far-more-efficient "smart" structural
             components for aircraft and concrete structures. 

             The research was presented here today (July 9, 1998) in a
             keynote address at the fifth International Conference on
             Composites Engineering by Chung, who holds the Niagara
             Mohawk Chair in Materials Research at UB. 

             "We have achieved zero resistance without cooling and without
             a superconducting material," said Chung. 

             "With structural electronics, the structural composite itself can
             act as the electrical circuitry, but the fibers in the composite are
             far less conductive than copper. Our research shows that it is
             possible to overcome that resistance and make these structural
             electronics far more efficient," she said. 

             This finding of negative resistance flies in the face of a
             fundamental law of physics: Opposites attract. 

             Chung explained that in conventional systems, the application of
             voltage causes electrons -- which carry a negative charge -- to
             move toward the high, or positive end, of the voltage gradient. 

             But in this case, the electrons move the other way, from the plus
             end of the voltage gradient to the minus end. 

             "In this case, opposites appear not to attract," said Chung. 

             The researchers are studying how this effect could be possible. 

             Chung, working with Shoukai Wang, a UB doctoral candidate in
             mechanical and aerospace engineering, made the discovery
             while conducting research on the intrinsic electrical properties of
             carbon composites related to developing "smart materials," in
             which she has played a leading role. 

             Chung explained that it is the unusually high pressure used to
             cure the carbon-epoxy composite that appears to be responsible
             for the finding. 

             "We were looking at the effect of curing pressure on the junction
             between carbon-fiber layers, and were making electrical
             measurements of the interface," she said. "When we saw the
             negative resistance at the interface, we didn't believe it for quite
             a few months. But after checking and rechecking our
             connections, using different meters over a period of time and
             observing the continuous change of resistance from positive to
             zero and then to negative values during curing, we came to
             realize that what we were seeing was truly negative resistance." 

             According to Chung, an unknown mechanism must be at work
             that is being triggered by sufficient contact between the layers of
             carbon fibers. 

             In the experiments, two layers of carbon fibers oriented in
             different directions and bound together by epoxy, Portland
             cement or pressure demonstrated negative resistance as low as
             -8 ohms for a contact area of one square centimeter. (An ohm is
             a unit that measures electrical resistance.) 

             The researchers noted that absolute zero resistance can be
             achieved when the values of positive and negative resistors
             connected in series match exactly. 

             "It's a matter of tailoring them to make them exactly the same,"
             said Chung. 

             A patent application has been filed on the invention. 

             Previous patents filed by other researchers on negative resistance
             have been limited to very narrow ranges of the voltage gradient. 

             In contrast, the UB researchers have exhibited negative
             resistance that does not vary throughout the entire gamut of the
             voltage gradient. 

             Companies that are interested in technical information on the
             invention should contact the UB Office of Technology Transfer
             at 716-645-3811 or by e-mail at

You have a problem with that? Not only does private ownership of nukes seem
the obvious choice for 'national defence' in an anarcho-capitalist society
(e.g. Vernor Vinge's 'The Ungoverned'), but how exactly are you going to
stop people buying nukes if they want them?

And given that the US government has come close to nuking Russia by
accident several times and recent reports show that Russia came within
three minutes of nuking the US in 1995, governments are clearly not 
competent to own them.

I think that this is becomming an argument for arguments sake. I was just
saying that i found that there was to much gun discussion on the list. I
have said that. And that's it.

Suicide rates and statistics which I have no acces to is not in my interrest
to discuss. That's only more noise on the list. No matter how relevant and
interresting that discussion might be under different circumstances.

Evolutionary stability only applies to *iterated* games.  Notably, Tit for
Tat is a *very* well proven strategy for the Prisoner's Dilemma; it's also
in keeping with egoism AND utilitarianism, to that extent.  So in any
situation in which the game is iterated, I'd bet on Tit for Tat.

However, there are situations in which the game is not iterated;  these
are generally situations in which the players are unknown to each other. 
In these situations, there can be only two strategies:  defect or keep
silent.  Egoism would demand that we defect whenever the game is not
iterated, and that leaves us all worse off.  "Defect" is not a rational
solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma, by the generalization principle. 
"Keep silent" is.

Utilitarianism does not depend on egoism.  When we play Tit for Tat,
egoism and utilitarianism agree.

We must never presume that we have eliminated evil; we will always have to
take measures to protect ourselves against crime and coercion, because
there is no utopia...

   Sorry if this isn't timely. 

     There is no such thing as a "gay gene". Homosexuality is not 
genetic, but environmental. The Study previously refereed to in this 
thread was done of women who were at Dresden during the bombing, and 
were pregnant. Their male offspring were homosexual at at rate of 80% in 
stead of the societal average of 10%. Homosexuality is caused by the 
underproduction or overproduction of a certain hormone in the mother 
during the gestation of the fetus (I believe in the third trimester). It 
has been documented that regulating this hormone in rats can create 
butch or effeminate homosexual rats, as well as straight ones. It should 
be noted that this applies to male rats only, there was no correlation 
found for female rats. All of this information can be obtained in the 
Discovery Channel's special called "Brain Sex". I belive these studies 
are referenced and explained in the third hour of the documentary. 

                                Hope this helps,
                                        Jim Barnebee

Concerning cryonics this "soul" issue can be easily dealed with: 

A counter question :  When does this "soul" enter the body ?

Assumed that the believers in a "soul" answer that this does 
happen at the point of fertilization of the egg-cell (or even 
earlier) :

The fact that frozen embryos have grown into healthy and normal 
adults proves that cryonics does preserve the soul (supposed 
that there is any).

If it is the same consciousness, I would agree.
However, this begs the question at hand, which
is:  *Is* this the same consciousness, or a very
similar consciousness which happens to have
the original consciousness' memories?

Perhaps you will agree that consciousness is somewhat
more complicated than arithmetic? :)  When dealing with
other simulations, it seems clear that the most 
straightforward way to run a Macintosh program on a
PC is not to rewrite the program from scratch, but to 
simulate the Macintosh to the program.  It may be that
this will be the *only* practical way to transfer 
consciousness to a non-brain computer.

By subjectively experiencing the memories.
This seems very clear to me.  If I experience
a memory from your brain, of you thinking about
being conscious, then I know that you are
(or were, at least, for that period) conscious,
as that is the only way such a memory could be
produced.

They don't have to produce the same effect, I only
have to *know* that you thought about being 
conscious, which is the same as being conscious.

I don't know whether the 6 year old John Clark (or Randall Randall)
is dead.  Perhaps further knowledge about consciousness will
allow us to determine things like this.

But if no one died, who is that dead guy?  Did 
the consciousness inside him magically jump
to the other John Clark and combine with it?  I
would say that the fellow who used to own that
dead body has died, even though this doesn't
affect the fellow who is exactly like him, except
for location.

Nor am I arguing that the hardware changes the

it is very important to have continuity in consciousness,

Certainly there is a great deal of hostility amongst some Quebecois towards
English-speaking Canada, though as yet there have been few acts of
violence.  Actually that's not quite true, in 1970 there *was* a Quebec
Liberation Front -- the FLQ -- that performed some kidnappings and at least
one murder. Since then, the violence has been mostly verbal/written.

Regarding your prediction about a new QLF, it might make an interesting
claim on the Foresight Exchange (http://www.ideosphere.com). Care to draft
one?

No apology needed. If I seem to be purposely blind, it's because I've found

Agreed, but where have I argued for gun control?  My argument has been that
it may not alwasy make sense for individuals to own guns.

"Lack of oversight" is generally a good thing; I think you meant "lack of
foresight" ;->

I question how well a civilian population armed with assault rifles etc.
could really resist government forces, given likely disparities in
weaponry, training, technology etc.  How many times has an armed citizenry
successfully resisted its government going totalitarian?  In the American
Revolution, I assume that most of the militias were at least initially
armed with private weapons (is this true?), but keep in mind that the army
they were fighting had an ocean between it and its major source of
reinforcements and supplies, and that another country (France) offered
assistance to the rebels.

Now explain why destroying a person's personality is somehow better than
destroying their body? If uploading advocates are correct, then there's
essentially no difference.

You seem to be arguing that to blow up a computer which is running an
uploaded human would be awful, but to poke around inside that uploaded
human and reprogram it as you see fit is fine.

Either way the original uploaded human is no longer there, and I see no 
real difference between the two results. Ethically speaking I'd rather
shoot them and be done with it than try to turn them into some 'perfect'
person.

No, I was speaking of the total number of operations necessary to evolve 
and intelligence.  My thinking was that a population of 10^15 entities 
roughly as complex as a human brain, evolving for 10^10 years or so, with 
the same speed of operation as the brain (1Hz, to a first 
approximation) ought to evolve into something quite interesting.  After 
all, that's not a bad approximation to the human evolutionary path.

Moravec's argument doesn't seem especially sound to me.  I forgot the 
numbers -- they're much more modest than those I gave above -- but he 
seems to be implicitly assuming that the brain is just a big blob of 
hardware, in the sense that once we have the hardware necessary to 
support a brain-equivalent device, we'll be able to create one.  This 
neglect of software and the specific details of arhitecture seems highly 
dubious to me.

A point I quite like is that chemical reactions -- the basis for life as 
we know it -- typically progress at a rate on the order of Hz.  There 
are some fast exceptions, but, in any computational system, the relevant 
timescales are usually the slow ones. Solid state devices can work at 
GigaHerz or more.  Human beings have a factor of a 10^9 or so over nature 
in this regard.  Which is a good thing, because Nature has been going at 
it for ~10^9 years.  Nature's advantage due to size and parallelism 
are still considerable, though -- we need to work on those things.

Not really.  Much the same issues come up in both case, unless your 
storage is fantastically reliable.  Why?  Suppose your storage is not 
fantastically reliable.  Then you will need to do a "little" bit of error 
correction.  Unfortunately, that involves gates... which themselves need 
to be error corrected, and so on, down the line.   For this 
reason, there's not so much difference between memory and dynamics, unless 
the memory is fantastically reliable, so no error correction at all needs 
to be done.  I don't consider that likely for the sort of applications I 
have in mind, so I'm just using the dynamical figure for all error 
correction.

A very interesting article, thanks for the link.  It doesn't 
seem to say much about errors or error correction, though.  Some work has 
been done on these subjects (in reversible computing); I don't recall the 
results.

Sorry, but it isn't that simple. Practically nothing in psychology is
100% genetic or environmental, usually it is a complex mixture. Often
people misreport the discovery of a gene linked to a trait as if the
gene was the sole cause.

(Based on chapter 11 in _Biological Psychology_ by James W. Kalat,
which I happen to have handy. References at the end)

There is some data that levels of testosterone during the middle of
the second month to the fifth month might influence sexual
orientation; decreased levels increase the number of homosexual males
(Ellis & Ames 1987) in animal models (Adkins-Regan 1988), and
increased levels the number of homosexual females. However, these
studies also caused anatomical changes, which are not observed among
humans.  Stress during the last part of the pregnancy might also
increase the number of homosexual offspring, perhaps due to
endorphines from the mother acting as anti-testosterone in the fetus'
hypthalamus (Ward, Monaghan & Ward 1986).

However, the evidence among humans for a link between maternal stress
and homosexuality is relatively weak: one study (Ellis, Ames, Peckham
& Burke 1988) found an increased number of stressful events during the
second trimester of pregnancy, but another study failed to observe it
(Bailey, Willerman & Parks 1991).

The consensus seems to be that prenatal hormones play a role, but are
not that strong influence.

The evidence for a genetic link is fairly clear, but does not explain
all homosexuality. Bailey & Pillard 1991 and Bailey, Pillard, Neale &
Agyei 1993 produced the following picture in a twin/family study of
homosexuals:

                     Probability of
                     homosexual orientation

                      Male           Female

Monozygotic twin       52%            48%
Dizygotic twin         22%            16%
Sister                                14%
Adopted brother/sister 11%             6%

The percentage of homosexuals in the population in general is around
5-10%, with fewer reported females. These results suggest that there
is a genetic correlation, but even in monozygotic twins it is not
strong enough to account for more than 50%. 

In a study of more remote relatives, it was observed that for
homosexual males there was an increase in probability of homosexuality
on the mother's side, suggesting an X-chromosome linkage (Hamer, Hu,
Magnussoon, Hu & Pattuccio 1993). 

So, to sum up, there is evidence for a genetic link, but it doesn't
account for all the variation, and the evidence for hormonal effects
isn't that strong. These results, together with the observed
biological changes in homosexual's brains (mostly in the diencephalon)
suggest that purely psychological explanations do not work to explain
it.


ObTranshuman: An interesting question is what would happen if it was
possible to relatively simply adjust one's brain to change sexual
preferences at will. How many people would try it? My guess is that
relatively few adults would do it, since their preferences had already
become a part of their self-image and they would not want to change
that. Among adolescents experimentation might reasonably be expected
to be higher. It would be interesting to study more what traits people
regard as too central to be changed and what traits they could accept
changing. For example, practically everybody seems to accept a better
memory or sharper perception, many people would likely want to
'polish' their personalities but not change them outright, and very
few if any people want to change their basic value systems. Is this
because the things we might accept changing are not as rooted in our
values as the 'sacred' parts?

This may be my problem as well.  Until I have some proof that the other
entity is me, I will give up my current will to live.  Not being able to
prove that it isn't me, isn't enough.  I have to stop experiencing me as
only this body, and somehow start experiencing me in the other body.  If
my perceptions don't transfer, then I don't feel that the "me" has
transferred.

Maybe that is the key.  A copy is a copy.  It is not movement of
anything from me to the new body.  What if the new body immediately
malfunctions and dies?  Will I feel that I am dead.  No, I'm still alive
in my original body the same as I always was.  Nothing has changed for
me.  Even if the copy doesn't die, nothing has changed for me.

This might help me as well.  It is the creation of two versions of me,
each supposedly equally valid, and then the killing of one of them that
bothers me.  If every neuron of my brain were replaced by an artificial
neuron, one at a time, I would feel like it was still me.  It is the
point at which we go to kill a sentient being that bothers me.
(Especially when I am currently that sentient being!)

My fear is never waking up again.  Being slow, or being temporarily dead
is not so bad.  It is when you get to the point that you stretch the
metaphor of sleep or suspension to permanency that it becomes too much
for me.

No, because I would perceive a continuous consciousness.  When I watch a
movie at 60 frames per second, I perceive continuous movement.  The
knowledge that it is really stopping and starting does not bother me.
If you were to perceptibly turn the movie on and off while I am trying
to watch it, then I would be bothered.  If you shut the movie off
completely so that I never get to see any more, that would be the worst
case.

The strange part is that a bullet through my brain would also be
undetectable to me.  I would not feel it or detect it in any way.  So I
could not argue that the resulting dead body would object to being dead.
I can only argue that if I had foreknowledge of the event, I would
object.

When you propose switching processors, you terminate one program and
start up another.  The newly started program experiences activity and
therefore does not consider itself dead.  The shut down program is dead.
It is not experiencing anything.  Yes, I might consider this death if
the original program is deleted from memory after the new program is
copied.

These examples are fuzzy because we don't know enough about future
computers or how life would be in them.  What you are asking is the same
as if you brainwashed my twin brother to "think like me" and then
pointed a gun at me and pulled the trigger.

You seem to be trying to prove that individual components of my brain
can be shut down without affecting the whole.  If you make a copy of me,
you have not modified my brain in any way.  Then when you kill the
original, you destroy the entire brain just as if you killed the
individual without making a copy.  What difference is there to the
original in these two scenarios?  I don't see any difference or basis
for different reactions.

You keep asking the same question over and over in different ways.  I'm
not sure why you expect to get a different answer at some point.  As
long as the original object/function that I define as "me" ceases to
exist, I object on the grounds that I don't want to cease to exist.  For
me to find a procedure acceptable, you must convince me that the
original definition of "me" is no longer valid, and that a new
definition of "me" has replaced it.  You then will destroy the old "me"
and replace me with a new person who has been redefined to be "me".

I enjoy these kinds of discussions.  There obviously are two different
camps of thought here.  I'm not sure that either has converted members
of the other.

Actually, I am not interested in the number of circuits, but in the
number of distinct individuals with differing points of view, even if
they differ only by location.  I don't care about removing a single
circuit, but when you reduce the total number of viewpoints in the
universe, then I believe there has been a death.  If the viewpoint being
terminated is the original one where I am now, then I believe that I
will be the one who is dead.

Actually, you are right and I retract my position.  Female pregnancies
are the limiting factor in population, not male availablility.

Agreed.  I thought you were saying that the trait couldn't evolve.  You

I don't know about this.  It implies that guys can't get dates because
there aren't enough females in the world, and that increasing the
dateable population increases dates.  I would guess that other factors
would influence popularity more than mere numbers of partners.

I agree with this.  Individual choice over one's own continued
existance.  To terminate one copy and measure the acceptability from the
viewpoint of another copy seems unacceptable to me.

I posted some statistics earlier, but no one seems to have noticed.  My
findings do not indicate that U.S. rates are lower than Europe, but
quite the opposite.  Do you have a source for your figures?  Mine show
Denmark at 13.4/100,000 for males and 2.3/100,000 for females.  The U.S.
rates are 21.9/100,000 for males and 3.8/100,000 for females.

I submit that #2 and #3 are the exact same scenario for our world.  No
atom will be different, no action will be changed.  By all measurements
and laws of physics, the person on our world in scenario #2 and #3
experience the exact same fate, atom per atom.  Yet you interpret these
identical fates differently.  The fate of these people have always been
interpreted as death throughout all time.  Even in scenario #2 you
interpret it as death.  Now, suddenly, you are changing the definition
and saying that the exact same event is no longer considered death.  You
are interpreting the death by some mystical definition not relating to
any laws of physics or any scientific measurement of the body to
determine if it is dead.

The only thing that makes the last scenario acceptable to you is that
you're dead.  You seem to think that it is OK for one copy to die if the
other copy lives.  Is it OK for one copy to be horribly crippled in the
murder attempt while the other goes unscathed?  Is it OK for one copy to
be in constant pain, while the other lives pain free?  If not, why would
it be acceptable to diverge these copies by way of death, but not in any
other way.  If the pain or suffering of one bothers you, why doesn't the
death of the same one bother you?  If one of them were in pain, and it
bothered you, would killing it resolve you problem?  Since it is dead,
but you don't count it as dead, does that erase any prior pain and
suffering since it can't remember it?

I might like to reply to your response if I only understood it.  Like
I said, I'm new to the subject of ethics and even worse its been a
while since I read Axelrod's Evolution of Cooperation.  I don't
remember non iterated games and so I have no idea what "keep silent"
means.  Please afford me some enlightenment.  Does it mean don't play
games that are non-iterated?

Yes, this more accurately reflects the current understanding among

I'm not so sure about this.  You appear to suggest that the behavioral
patterns which make up our personality exist because we prefer those traits
over others.  As I'm sure you're aware, personality is also a product of
complex interactions between our genes and the environment (neither of which
we have a whole lot of control over).  I think many people have personality
traits that they don't particularly value.  Many introverts, for example,
might prefer to be more socially competent and outgoing.  Many who are
impulsive would prefer to be have greater control.  Some who rely heavily on
thinking through everything in a highly rational manner might prefer to have
better intuitive skills and vice versa.  I think most people would try to
achieve a greater balance if they could pick and choose personality traits
(a little more of this, a little less of that).  They might try to tailor
their personality to be more congruent with their career to enhance their
success and work satisfaction. They might make changes designed to enrich
their relationship with a significant other and gain the satisfaction that
comes with enhanced intimacy.  Too large of a change would, I agree, be too
scary for most.

Er, no.  I was referring to the Prisoner's Dilemma, a classic game from
the perpective of game theory and an interesting situation from the
perpective of rational philosophy.

Suppose you had two prisoners about to go on trial for some atrocious
crimes.  Suppose neither prisoner can communicate with the other.  Imagine
that the prosecutor offers each a deal: they can either confess to the
crime and incriminate their partner (aka "defect") or keep silent.  The
deal is arranged this way: if both prisoners choose to keep silent, then
both will spend a short while in prision but will eventually go free. 
However, if one defects while the other keeps silent, then the defector
may go free, but the one who keeps silent is killed.  Finally, if they
both defect, they both spend a life in prison.

Usually, when we think about this game in the context of of game theory,
we give each of the consequences explicit payoffs; ie I get 2 points if I
defect and you keep silent, I get 1 point if we both keep silent, I lose 1
point if we both defect, and I lose two pints if I keep silent while you
defect.  Situations like this one arguably happen fairly regularly, though
the number of situations under which the payoffs are so arranged is
probably overstated.  However, it seems reasonable that there are a
variety of situations under which you may gain at the expense of others; 
egoism would dictate that you do so, because it is to your best gain, no
matter what the other player does.  However, if both players play this
strategy, both lose 1 point; (though each player would have lost more had
they kept silent).  On the other hand, if both players keep silent, both
gain a point, yet each player could have gotten more, given the other
player's choice, had they defected. 

This game gets interesting when we have to play it more than once (we use
the point system rather than the prison sentances, in this case.) 
Contests have been held to try to come up with the optimal strategy in
iterated versions of the game; ie the best strategy when you must play
against the same player multiple times.  The undisputed winner, to the
best of my knowledge, is Tit for Tat:  keep silent on the first game, then
do whatever your opponent did last game in further iterations.  So if I'm
playing against Tit for Tat, and I keep silent on the first round, Tit for
Tat will keep silent on the second round.  If I defect on the second
round, Tit for Tat will defect on the third; etc. 

The fact that Tit for Tat is the undisputed winner in terms of points
seems to imply that it is the optimal strategy from the egoistic
standpoint; this is contrary to our analysis above of the non-iterated
version.  More interesting, IMO, is the fact that it also seems to be
compatible with utilitarianism, particularly when two Tit for Tats are
playing against each other.

Evolutionary stability only applies to the iterated versions of the games
I described above.  While "Always Keep Silent" is certainly compatible
with itself, if ever an "Always defect" player entered the game, it would
clear out the others; it would not fare so well against Tit for Tat; while
it would eek out slightly better than Tit for Tat, it would do poorly
against itself, whereas Tit for Tat excels against itself.  That would
mean that Tit for Tat would reproduce a lot more in an evolutionary
scenario, through there would always remain some equilibrium fraction of
"always defect"ors in most populations.  Interesting, no?

Anyway, as I said, all this means is that in most cases utilitarianism and
egoism will agree on Tit for Tat.  The question then becomes: what stategy
should we take for the NON-iterated games, games in which you will not
play against the same person again, or in which you will not know against
whom you are playing?  Egoism will say "always defect" in these
situations; utilitarianism will say "keep silent."

If egoism is rational, then it is rational for both players; yet egoism
would demand suboptimal consequences according to its own value system:
the egoistic players find themselves worse off than they would have been
otherwise.  If we agree that rationality, at least in part, involves doing
what is necessary in order to get the optimal consequences (where the
"optimal" consequences is determined by one's value system) then egoism
dictates that the way to fulfill the ends of egoism is to reject egoism;
in other words, it is *not* rational to be an egoist, because it leaves
the players worse off than it would be had they been utilitarians.

When dealing with human behavior there is always the possibility that
memetic evolution may have found the same fitness function that genetic
evolution did, not to mention the "ape" factor....

I'm not sure I understand your objection.  Let me try to spell my point out
more clearly:

The "normal" mating pattern for humans has the young males competing with
each other to "get laid", i.e. to convince young women to let them
demonstrate their mating skills.  The prize for the winners is a bit of
sexual experience, which will make them more impressive to the next female
they mate with.  Eventually most of them will impress a female enough to
form a semi-permanent, largely monogamous partnership.

Males who are highly valued in the mating game have the opportunity to try
out more mates than males who aren't, gaining experience in the process.

Because of this, females evolved to value sexual expertise in a mate, as it
is indicative that other females found the male interesting, which means he
has genes which will enhance the female's reproductive success....

Evolution naturally found a way to take advantage of this situation:  Males
who were willing to fool around with other males could build experience
that would mark them as experienced mates to the females, without having to
compete directly with the other males for the privledge.

The downside to this strategy was that a propensity to have sex with males
tended to stick with them even after they had found a female mate, which
means they didn't tend to settle into the same, largely-monogamous
relationship that the straight males did, but rather continued to have sex
on the side with other gay males.  This increases their risk of disease,
which is the natural limit on this stratedgy.  If there were no STD's, we
would all be gay (or "bi", as we would say today).  The current memetic
environment that encourages gays to only have sex with other gays is, of
course, devastating to this stratedgy.

If my shotgun approach didn't answer your objection, please try again....

This IS an interesting point.  

Suppose  that how we deal with such minor nuisances as guns be considered a
"trial run" or a "learning experience" in regards to dealing with the much
more serious "powerful tools" anticipated in the future.  

Are we learning anything?

I've heard that in a technological society it is IMPOSSIBLE to ban weapons.  I
beleive this is true.  In fact...it doesnt seem that the government is doing
all that well banning weapons (and drugs) in their prisons...much less in
society as a whole.  This would seem to indicate that no matter how many laws
are passed...nor how stringent the punishment...guns(weapons) and drugs will
still be available. 

As technology advances it would appear that the "guns and drugs" will get more
potent...AND more difficult to control.

Given this reasoning...it would appear that a method of  "living with it"
should be developed.    As has been mentioned it would seem that where there
are less restrictions on guns (concealed carry laws...certain "lenient"
states) then individuals tend to be more responsible in the use of guns.
Likewise I've been led to understand that the same logic follows in regards to
drugs.  I don't know for sure but I understand that in certain European
Countries there are much less drug restrictions than in the US and much less
"abuse".  Once again...it would appear...that increased freedom leads to
increased responsibility.

Keeping this in mind perhaps we should be working toward a more responsibile
populance...because someday sooon the REALLY nasty weapons will become
available.

Hello:
I'm not a member of the Extropian List but I am an associate of John K Clark 
and I've been looking over his shoulder when he posted some really stupid  
things. He just left his office for lunch but he made the mistake of leaving  
his computer on, he's such a dope, so I figured this is the perfect 
opportunity to set the record straight and send a message to the list.  
Mr. Clark would probably fire me if he knew about this so please keep it 
under your hat.

The important point is that Mr. Clark is dead wrong and there is a huge 
difference between a copy and the original and what's more I can prove it 
with  mathematical certainty.

Let A = the original  and let  B = the copy

Let's assume that Mr. Clark is correct and the original is the same as the  
copy, then:

A = B

Multiply both sides by A and you have

A^2 = A*B

Now add A^2 -2*a*B to both sides

A^2 + A^2 -2*a*B = A*B + A^2 -2*A*B

Using basic algebra  this can be simplified to

2*( A^2 -A*B) = A^2 -A*B

Now just divide both sides by A^2 -A*B and we get

2 = 1

The conclusion is absurd so the assumption can not be correct, the copy is 
not the same as the original and Mr. Clark does not know his ass from a hole 
in the ground. 

I have not told Mr. Clark about my brilliant finding because, because, ah,  
because of a very good reason, the reason is, ah, I was afraid proving him 
wrong would drive him into a fit of suicidal despair. Of course if you were  
to tell the bastard about it there is no way I could stop you, just don't 
mention my name.

>gay.  

I'm no expert in this field, but I suspect the language used here might be
profoundly misleading.  Does overcrowding produce dedicatedly homosexual
rats, or just a marked increase in observed buggery?  If the latter, this
seems to me possibly due to enhanced territorial disputes, etc.  Or do
crowded male rats stop mounting female rats in heat?  Do they *prefer*
males?  Is it only some (`gay') rats who prefer buggery all the time, or
all rats some of the time?  Anyone here know?

Not true. The atoms in the two scenarios are arranged differently because

        >in scenario #2 you interpret it as death. 
             

Yes because staring at a gun pointed at my head for 10 seconds has changed me, 
changed the pattern of atoms in me, so I no longer have an exact copy. In
scenario #3 we're both changed by an equal amount so I still have a copy
although I do not know it.

There is no alternative. If one copy has been terminated I can't measure his

You are assuming that finding a female and reproducing is the goal for
all genetics.  You therefore assume that gay males are only practicing
with males for when they finally get a female.

You assume that males don't compete for male mates.  In animals where
homosexuality is seen (all higher mammals) the straight males fight over
female mates and the gay males fight over male mates.

This seems to indicate that the gay gene is not evolved for reproductive
purposes.  I thought this was what you were claiming earlier.

You seem to think that gay animals (and maybe humans) have more STD's
than straight animals.  I no of no evidence for this.

The only way this could be true is if more gays are born, and the gay
gene could over-compete with the straight gene, and that diseases kill
most of the gay population down so that they don't outnumber the
straights.  We would see such a pattern in nature if it existed.

With all this talk about gay genes, I'm suprised that you still assert
that gay males override their natural interest in females by choosing to
be gay.  Scientific research shows that gays don't choose to act gay,
but really are attracted one way over the other.

> If my shotgun approach didn't answer your objection, please try again....

Sorry, I think it raised a whole bunch of new ones.  I just don't see
homosexuality as means to achieve heterosexual mating.  I don't see
STD's being specifically oriented toward one orientation over another.
I don't see everyone turning gay, except that the gays get wiped out by
disease at a faster rate than straights.  I don't see gay males dating
females except where peer pressure forces them to act gay.

Interesting conversation though.  I just wonder if being cooped up in a
cubicle all day asserts the same influence on me that overcrowding does
on a rat...

Did anyone watch Dateline this evening on ABC from 8:00 to 9:00?

I was interviewed for a segment on body sculpting, etc.   I was told  that
it was supposed to air tonight, but didn't catch it.

My view is that there is no difference between two instances of "you"
and one, if they are in perfect synchrony.  My various examples are meant
to illustrate this by blurring the lines between the two.

It seems implausible that doubling the width of the wires would change
one "you" into two.  So I don't see why reducing the thickness of the wires
in the simulation would make anyone cease to exist.  Perhaps my wording
above was unclear that this is what I was proposing?

It seems to me that the same argument could
be applied to *anyone* you wanted to kill.  After
all, they won't care afterward, right?  The copy
is irrelevant to the situation of the person here.
You seem to be saying that killing people at
random is fine, as long as it is painless?

Exactly. But how large is that change? I think most people would like
to do some tweaking of their personalities, but would they change them
much? 

We tend to build a set of attributions about ourselves, that evaluates
and explains how we are to ourselves. Even fairly negative traits are
often attributed positive values ("I'm not aggressive, I'm assertive")
and become part of our self-image. This suggests that we might not
*want* to change some parts of our personality or self simply because
we have already given them positive attributes (regardless of whether
they actually are positive sometimes or we are just protecting our
self-image), even if they are fairly negative. A violent person might
have a hidden fear of weakness and being a victim, which makes him
regard his violence as something subtly good (he might of course
explain it away in a variety of ways to make it acceptable to himself
and others). If given the chance to become less violent, would he take
it? Most likely not, since doing that would both go against his
self-serving bias of regarding his behavior as neutral or good, and
his hidden fear of being weakened.

So there are already personality traits I think people would not
change, even if they would afterwards think the change was for the
better. This is an instance of a general problem, many mental
structures are self-supporting loops and resistant to change,
regardless of their use. The classic example on this list is of course
religions and similar memes, but they are likely common on all levels.

The question here is how this affects self-transformation. We can of
course learn to identify this kind of loops, and that will make it
easier for us to change those that are not in accord with our
values. But we should be aware of higher-level loops, for example
involving our own self-transformation values. It might turn out that
given an initial personality and no too extreme circumstances,
self-transformation can only reach part of the space of available
personalities, we deliberately chose away the others. The end result
may be a consistent personality with few low-level self-supporting
loops and a few high-level memes regulating possible changes that make
further change regarded as unnecessary. As circumstances change, the
person will sometimes change too, but unless these high-level memes
are changed (a fairly drastic modification) the person will remain on
the same general track. This doesn't exclude tremendous personal
growth, but it will be more of the same, not anything utterly
different.

Not only did I notice, I pointed out that your figures are for:

Which aren't terribly useful when you're talking about the total suicide

I've just slightly modified Greg's arrrangement and added questions 
about transhumanist art, the singularity, uploading, and a few 
more suggested by Michael Nielsen (environment, dangers, 
superintelligence). We can still change the format later. I suggest 
we focus on one section at a time. (Those who have already made 
suggestions for suitable answers may want to repeat them since it 
would be convenient to have all anwers to one question on the same 
thread.)

Remember, both quotable one-liners and full answers are useful. (And 
I assume that everything posted on this thread becomes our common 
intellectual property that we can all cut and paste and use at will.)

GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSHUMANISM

What is transhumanism?

Transhumanism is the philosophy which advocates the use of technology
to overcome our biological limitations and transform the human
condition. The accelerating pace of technological development opens up
such revolutionary prospects as superhuman artificial intelligence and
molecular nanotechnology. The consequences of these developments may
include: the biochemical enrichment or redesign of our
pleasure-centres so we enjoy a richer diversity of emotions, life-long
happiness and exhilarating peak experiences every day; the elimination
of ageing; the abolition of disease; and perhaps the gradual
replacement of human bodies with synthetic enhancements and computers.
Or by contrast, it could mean that intelligent life will go extinct.
These are extreme possibilities. Yet they are taken seriously by an
increasing number of scientists and scientifically-literate
philosophers.


What is a posthuman?

A posthuman is a human successor that has been transformed and 
augmented to such a degree as to be no longer a mere human. 
Posthumans could be completely synthetic or they could be the result 
of extending a biological human's capacities with many partial 
augmentations. In either case, a posthuman would be a "higher" 
life-form than humans, in the same sense as a human could be 
said to be higher than an ape. More specifically, this means that a 
posthuman may have a greatly expanded intellect and memory; 
an indefinite life-span; the ability to choose it's own mental states 
and emotions. Also exosomatic ("outside-the-body") improvements 
count, such as rapid access to databases or networks containing huge 
landscapes of ideas and information; high-bandwidth communication 
links with other posthumans (almost like telepathy); and advanced 
manufactuing technologies for building physical structures.
	Most transhumanists think it is impossible to fully imagine what 
posthumans would do or what it would be like be a posthuman -- just 
as non-human primates cannot begin fathom the complexity of the 
human affairs.

Yes, I did misunderstand this.  I thought you meant a twisted pair of
wires, like speaker wire or a telephone wire, where there were two wires
in one casing.

I think double thickness of wire would still be one copy.  The size or
mass of the circuitry is not an issue for me.  The number of independent
programs that can run unchanged after the other ceases determined the
number of "individuals".

I do understand your view, and I do understand what you are trying to do
with your series of examples.  This converstation is interesting to me,
because someday I may have to make a decision based on this very
question.

Yes, you did.  Because of mail delays I didn't see your response until
later.  The agegroup 15-24 is all I could find on the web.  I am not
trying to limit the discussion to that range.

Good point.  I stand corrected.  So the only difference is your memory?
Your definiton of whether shooting someone in the head depends on what
data is stored in their memory?  This seems a weak basis for my tastes.

So killing the one body is not murder, but killing the other body that
only differs by one 10-second memory is murder?  My definitons of life
and death are more based on the condition of the body and future
viability.

This seems to be the flaw (in my opinion) with your argument.  You kill
one person and therefore ignore his desire to live because he now has no
opinion.  This is true with any dead body.  My point is that right now,
before I die, I know that I am against it.  I don't think we can merely
discount the wishes of the people we kill just because after they're
dead they no longer wish to live.

Here again you seem to indicate that by killing someone, they lose their
viewpoint, and therefore their desire doesn't count.  It seems that I
could argue the same thing and kill you right now.  You have not copies,
and you might not want to die, but after I do it you won't have a
viewpoint so it won't matter.

Remind me not to ask you for help if I am in pain...  But seriously, I
think we understand each other's views enough to predict them.  We just
wouldn't choose those views ourselves.  Where to steer the discussion
from here, to help understand why our opinions differ so?

Wow....I guess I'm seriously ABnormal then.  

I courted my lady for years...then we were married...THEN sexual
intercourse....and strictly monogamous for 23 years....."until death do us
part"...and it did.

I guess I'm more strange than I thought.

Well!.....that's all there is to it then.

You've mathematically "proven" it......and as we all know that makes it right.

The mathematical simulations of the Club of Rome, the mathematical simulations
relating to Global Warming....to name just two cases.  Math proved it...so it

Two poems by EON (one of my pen names) can be found at a charming 
little scifi magazine called Antipodean Science Fiction at 
http://www.nor.com.au/users/antisf/stordex.htm.  

One of the poems, 'The Waterborne', was inspired by 
a thread that took place last year on the >H list.  Also included are 
links to transhumanist resources and to  Natasha's art page, which 
contains more of my work.

Enjoy.

My... to have confidence of THAT calibre.  I guess all these psych and
genetics courses I'm currently enrolled in have spoiled me.  

All jokes about blue denim aside, most of the literature I read for my term
paper [which focused on sexual orientation] in Behavioral Genetics class
last semester leans toward a cluster of markers on the X chromosome [the
Xq28 region, if you care] which appear to be linked to at least one subtype
of male sexual orientation.

Good choice of papers, Anders.  It's one of my favorites.  

Beyond that, they've even managed to divvy up the "sexual orientation"
concept into 3 or 4 major subcategories.  The commonly held definition is
simply the sex (or sexes) I'm attracted to.  Cool.

Now, in addition, we also care about the sex(es) which is attracted to ME.
Some even mix in _my concept_ of which sex(es) I attract and am attracted to.  

Yet Jim up above seems to have it all figured out.  

>ObTranshuman: An interesting question is what would happen if it was
>possible to relatively simply adjust one's brain to change sexual

Well, for us bisexuals, this isn't really an issue.  But one study I read
(which I can't seem to find in my collection of papers from Spring... I
might have to go re-look it up) had the scientists manipulating one (and
only one) facet of sexual orientation I discussed above.  That is, trying to
change the sex which likes the fruitfly while keeping the fruitfly attracted
to the original sex.  I'll get to the details when I can find the friggin'
paper.  (and it was fruitflies in the study, I wasn't disparaging anyone.)

And to whoever that guy was who wrote this...

We don't all live in a frat house.  That's the limitation of your "normal"
pattern.

Not true, if you would keep silent and I would defect, you would be
even worse off than if we both defect. Now, would you you really

You're using the word "egoism" in a very simplistic manner here.
In the real world, the payoff function is a very complex relationship,
that includes most of the people that you know and even many that you
don't (in most cases indistinguishable from a utilitarian one).
On the other hand, if you're a Utilitarian, you're forcing someone
else's payoff function on me. It's a nice offer, but I think I'll pass.

Communications breakdown, sorry, I didn't mean to cause you to explain
the basics of the Prisoners' Dilemma.  I usually use the term
"cooperate" in place of your "keep silent" term especially when
comparing to "defect".  This is probably because I tend not to think
in terms of the original example that gave title to the Prisoners'
Dilemma.  The original author could have given a little more thought
to that example and used something more appropriate like birds picking
fleas off each other or something IMHO.

We both agree that the best known strategy for iterated Prisoners
Dilemma is "tit for tat" for both egoism and utilitarianism.  I know
Prisoners Dilemma is a well developed field of study and we both agree
it can be a useful tool for evaluating ethics philosophies.  Although,
I never understood what Richard Dawkins was getting at in "The Selfish
Gene" when he commented that he does not advocate the use of Prisoners
Dilemma to develop a system of ethics.  Maybe he was referring to the
mismatch with a lot of real word situations.  Anyway, if ethics is to
be rational, IMHO game theoretics allows a more critical evaluation
than any other I know of.  We must have a leg to stand on even if it
is a little shaky.  Thats why its still a philosophy.

You have stated that non-iterated Prisoners dilemma does not render
evolutionarily stable systems.  Intuitively, this does not play well
between my ears.  But even if so (assuming you've seen the results of
some computer simulation), again intuitively, would not some
strategies be better than others in this game.  I would bet on a "tit
for tat" strategy before going all out with "always cooperate"
(utilitarianism) or "always defect" (egoism) even if I'm
non-rationally "tit"ing this guy because that other guy "tat"ed me.  I
can see "always cooperate" as the best strategy only in utopia which
we both agree does not exist. Oh logic where have I failed thee.

Even if I'm right, our only disagreement could be that utilitarianism
evokes the "always cooperate" strategy in non-iterated prisoners
dilemma.  Maybe then we find that egoism and utilitarianism evokes the
same strategy for iterated and non-iterated versions of the game.  If
so, maybe this is what Dawkins warned us about.  This would leave us
the exercise of finding a version of game theoretics that evokes a
different strategy for egoism and utilitarianism.  If it cant be
found, maybe this implies as I originally suspected, that
utilitarianism depends on pockets of egoism and they both work
together to form an evolutionarily stable system.

John Stossel, the first extropian public figure?  It could happen.  He
has demonstrated a talent for shattering world views.  His technique
of pretending to take the popular side of an issue and slowly being
convinced otherwise by reality and critical thinking is entertaining
and effective.  Imagine all of the dumbfounded masses after watching
"Greed" (transcript at
http://www.abcnews.aol.com/onair/specials/html_files/spe0203a.html) or
"Consensual Crimes".  His biography is at
http://www.abcnews.aol.com/onair/2020/html_files/stosselj.html
I'm not suggesting that we all send letters or email to him about
extropian principles and ideas.  I think that would be counter
productive.  But, some of the more Charismatic extropians with
accumulated clout (you know who you are Max, Natasha, Katherine etc.)
could collaborate on a way to get a dialogue started.  I know this is
a little pushy, but lets get this thing out there.  Thats when the
excitement really starts.

Me too.  I'll start...

I just scanned through the principles, searching for debate topics.  I can
only find one issue worth discussing, it is the only problem I have ever
had with the principles, and it has been discussed before:

It is the conflict between Boundless Expansion && (Intelligent Technology
&& Spontaneous Order)  The question is, Boundless Expansion for whom?

All it takes is an intelligent AI with a life goal of wiping out the
surface of our planet with a chain of nuclear explosions, and no one will
be Boundlessly Expanding anywhere.  Is this AI not the perfect example of
IT and SO-- the product of technological progress, free-market access to
uranium, and a robo-hacker's unregulated tinkerings?  How do you defeat a
robot with global kamakazi urges and nuclear know-how?

One argument I have heard is that defensive technology will always out-run
offensive technology.(following the parallel of encryption/decryption)
Sounds nice... maybe "Star Wars" could fire their lasers at the
robo-nukes.  Of course, "Star Wars" was not designed to handle a
robot that can readily obtain the components of a nuclear weapon, assemble
them in its Los Angeles appartment, and detonate the nuke right there.

I think there are two questions that come out of this paranoid line of
reasoning:

1. Is this scenario any more likely than getting struck by lightning?
2. If (yes), what can we do to prevent it?

My answers at the moment:

1. yes, thunderstorms are rare in Vancouver
2. get out of this gravity well as fast as we can

My answers follow the Extropian principles, but they're not satisfying.

I just don't buy this common assumption that AI's will be looking out for
our best interests at all times.  How can we regulate them without
regulating humans beings and all the time maintaining our
prized "spontaneous order"?

Over the last couple of years I've been trying to put together a web
sight called "Transhuman For Dummies".  The goal was to try to explain
most of the transhuman issues in laymans terms with the assumption of
nearly complete ignorance of the reader reguarding extropian memes. 
The project has produced 20 pages of text with many attributed quotes
from this and other lists.  Below, I have cut and pasted various
paragraphs from these essays that I think are pertinant to the current
uploading topic:

When I was tackling the issue of uploading for myself, I had a lot of
difficulty with the question of what does it mean for me to survive. 
As a result I developed a thought experiment to try to resolve some of
the issues.  Imagine yourself lying on a table and on another table
next to you is a large empty bucket.  Now imagine that an experimenter
were able to take a single atom from your toenail and place it into
the bucket.  Then the experimenter goes to a stockpile of chemicals
and gets a new replacement atom of the same type that was removed and
inserts it into your toenail where the original atom was removed.  Now
the experimenter repeats this process for every atom in your whole
body from your feet to your brain.  At no time during the experiment
are you missing more than one atom from your body and thus you will
experience no side effects during the process. After all, no single
atom in your body or brain is critical for normal functioning.  I
don't think you could argue that each time an atom was removed and
then replaced that part of YOU had died and a part of an exact copy of
you had come alive.  This would be absurd.  At the end of the
experiment, all of the atoms in YOUR body have been replaced and YOUR
original atoms lay in a random pile in the bucket.  Now you are asked,
are YOU the random pile of atoms in the bucket (dead of course) or are
YOU the individual laying on the table made up completely of atoms
that were taken from the stockpile of chemicals?  I believe the
correct answer is, YOU are the individual lying on the table with your
new atoms.  This is because you have no ties with the individual atoms
that make up your physical body and mind.  In fact, atoms have no
individuality at all.  There is no way to distinguish between them. 
One carbon atom is exactly the same as another carbon atom.  The thing
that makes you YOU is the information of how these atoms are arranged
and the processing of that information.  Because atoms adhere to the
physical laws of the universe, they can be modeled or emulated in a
computer along with their interactions with other atoms.  This
emulation can be modeled in a way that represents the configuration of
atoms that make up your body and mind along with the environment with
which you interact.

This thought experiment was designed to allow you to separate the
identity of yourself from the physical world and understand that the
essence of your soul and personality is fully represented by
information and the processing of that information.  So a rational
selfishness for survival would be the desire for that information to
be preserved and allowed to continue processing.  This was a very big
step for me because I always felt a sort of selfishness for my
physical self (atoms and all) and I've probably stepped through the
above thought experiment hundreds of times even though its very
simple.  Once this is understood and accepted though, it's not too big
of a leap to understanding yourself as an upload.  For me, the
selfishness currently lies not in the atoms and not so much in the
information either, but in the processing of that information.  I have
spent a lifetime evolving a society of competing mental agents. 
Sometime in my infancy these competing agents reached a complexity of
sufficient critical mass to allow my consciousness to become
spontaneously self aware.  The continuing competition of this society
of mental agents has brought me great joy and pain due to the
struggles and resulting victory and defeats of the individual agents. 
To just bring all of this to an end and halt the execution and destroy
the code is something I would avoid to a great extreme.
 At the same time I would go to great lengths to ensure that the
information processing I call ME were not being processed by a
duplicate.  Shortly after the two processes diverged there would be
two instances of an individual calling himself Joe Jenkins.  This
individual would claim to own all of Joe Jenkins' property.  He would
claim relationships with my relatives, insist on living in my house,
sleeping in my bed. He would know many secrets that I prefer kept to
myself.  On thankgiving two people would show up at my parents house
claiming my indentity.
 For these reasons it should be every individuals right to prevent two
instances of his or her process to be animated and diverged.  The key
word here is diverged.  This is when the conflict of interest begins
and each click of the clock intensifies the difference.  As long as
there is no divergence, the two copies are nothing but dual redundancy
and thus are not capable of creating a conflict of interest.  Thus,
one of the redundancies could be halted with no ill effect to my
existence and it wouldn't matter which one was halted because both
would realize the other was not a divergent copy but only a
redundancy.  Flip a coin idiot (sorry I meant dummy).

We begin by presuming that the rational action is the action which results
in optimal consequences.  Both egoism and utilitarianism agree on this;
they just disagree over what "optimal" means.  We then go on to observe
that an ethical system is rational if and only if it is rational for both
players; if it is rational for me to defect, then it is also rational for
you to defect.  Egoism cannot only be rational for you; if it is rational
at all, it is rational for both of us.

If both players defect, both players find themselves worse off than they
would be had they chosen to cooperate.  Since egoism demands that both
players defect, despite the fact that its consequences are sub-optimal
compared to utilitarianism, egoism is not rational.

<sigh>  As I've already said many times before, this is true when the game
is iterated, which is most of the time.  I'd say utilitarianism and egoism
coincide at least 80% of the time, if not more.  However, egoism leaves us
worse off in that remaining 20% region, representing games where you don't
know who your opponent is or in which one or more players will not play
again.  Put simply, in a small number of cases, it is good from
the egoistic perspective to hurt others for profit.  Since utilitarianism
and egoism agree the rest of the time, and since we are made worse off
when we hurt each other in this way, we should reject egoism and adopt
utilitarianism instead.

I just joined the list and am jumping into the middle of this particular
thread but have some comments for the people who made the following remarks
(and others making a similar claim):



Harvey Newstrom wrote:
  "Scientific research shows that gays don't choose to act gay,
>but really are attracted one way over the other."

I gather that you are claiming that it's been proven that there is a
genetic basis for homosexuality. 

I'm a psychologist who has read a LOT of the original research in the areas
of gender, gender roles (one of my specialties), and sexual preference.  My
reaction to the above statement is HA-HA. We are FAR from "proving" one way
or another what the genetic bases (or lack of such ) for gender roles and
sexual preferences are.  The studies are slippery, fraught with
methodological problems, small in size, contradictory and highly
controversial. For every one that provides evidence FOR a genetic basis,
there is a study that fails to support it. We jut don't know yet -- so
please don't make such claims in an area that I suspect is outside your
area of expertise.  If I'm wrong about the issue of expertise, I'm prepared
to play dueling studies with you at some point(well, that is, if I have the
time!).   If this is outside your expertise, then you might do well to read
a little more before you make such claims.


In another post, Jim Barnebee said:
"All of this information can be obtained in the 
Discovery Channel's special called "Brain Sex". I belive these studies 
are referenced and explained in the third hour of the documentary."

The book on which this documentary was based is one of the most
intellectually dishonest books I have ever read. I can dispute almost every
page with studies that show the contrary, studies that were conveniently
overlooked by the authors. 

In fact, here is an outline of a critique that I use in my presentations on
the subject of gender.

Critique of Brain Sex 
(book by Anne Moir, Ph.D. and David Jessel)

Purports to show research evidence for differences in the brain that
provide a biological basis for gender-related behavior.

1.	Distorts by omission. Fails to cite researchers who contradict them or
reach 
different conclusions. No mention of contrary studies.
For example: 
a. Ehrhardt is in bibliography but not mentioned in text. Her conclusions
about prenatal hormonal abnormalities is very different than theirs. .
b. Kinsbourne, a researcher in brain-hemisphere differences, concludes that
no reliable sex difference exist.

2.	No mention of the critiques of studies they cite.
	For example:
	a. Ehrhardt’s review of research on abnormal prenatal
 hormones 
	b. Ehrhardt’s critique of Dominican Republic study .
	c. Fausto-Sterling’s "Myths of Gender" (though it’s in
bibliography)
	d. Ruth Bleier’s critiques

3.	Distort findings and exaggerates size of differences.
Ex: "Most women cannot read a map as well as a man."  No study backs that
up. Even in spatial abilities, the overlap is greater that the differences.

4.	Claims many sex differences are well-established and noncontroversial
that are in fact not!
For example:
Sex differences in math, verbal and spatial abilities--contrary to what
they claim, the consensus in psychology is that differences in math and
verbal abilities have disappeared and differences in spatial abilities,
while consistent, are not great enough to explain behavioral differences.

Brain hemisphere differences--still very controversial. 

5.  Innuendoes that mislead because no research backs them up; pure
speculation
 "could it be that…"   "may be…" 
 
6.  Lies

"Virtually every professional scientist and researcher has concluded that
the brains of men and women are different."
"Even researchers most hostile to the acknowledgment of sex differences
agree that [aggression] is a male feature, and one which cannot be
explained by social conditioning."

These statements are patent falsehoods. Researchers that they cite in their
bibliography would disagree with these statements, let alone the
researchers they leave out.

For example:
Anke Ehrhardt, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, John Money
Marcel Kinsbourne, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Ruth Bleier, Ruth Hubbard, Janet
Hyde, Carol Tavris

END OF OUTLINE

A far better book on the subject is "Sex on the Brain" by Deborah Blum
I don't even agree with all of this book --it still gives short shrift to
psychology and social conditioning (the author is a journalist who
specializes in biological science) -- but at least she is careful and
measured in her conclusions and seems quite honest in her attempt to
present the research accurately ---as opposed to "Brain Sex" which is a bad
joke.

On the opposite end (re conclusions) from "Brain Sex" is "Myths of Gender"
by Anne Fausto-Sterling (a biology prof at Brown)who is excellent at
showing the faulty reasoning behind a lot of the pop articles and some of
the studies.

The moral of all this is: before you make assertations in controversial
areas, be sure to read more than one side of the debate. [If the above
writers HAVE read the books I cited, then they are entitled to their
opinion but are still misleading in their comments. My guess is that they
have not read these books. Tell me if I'm wrong --ha-ha, I'm sure you will!]

In general, this is referred to as the "naturalistic" fallacy.  Basically,
it is a fallacy to presume that just because we have evolved some system
of ethics, it must be right.  By this argument, we could just as easily
operate entirely on instinct, which is more evolved (in the biological
sense) than logic, which may only have been around since Aristotle.  I
must agree, however, that he has made a mistake when he associates game
theory and the naturallistic fallacy: it is an entirely different argument
to say that we should agree on an ethical system which HAS evolved and to
say that we should agree on an ethical system which MUST evolve given
certain realistic presumptions. 

I personally see such simulations as part of the practical part the
answer, telling us more about what we ought to do within an ethical system
than defining the system itself.  I only mention it here because it is not
intuitively obvious that the game should have such a successful strategy
in the iterated version (which is what most of us play most of the time)
and the non-iterated version.  As I've already noted, consequentialism and
the generalization principle, which states that a rational system for one
person must also be rational for another person, together provide an
excellent argument for utilitarianism without these simulations.

They will all become Defectors if you try it.  Think: If a Tit for Tat
(TfT) plays against a Defector, TfT will defect on the next round.  If it
happens to defect against another TfT, the first TfT will cooperate on the
next round, but the second TfT will defect on the next round.  No matter
how many TfTs there are, one of them will always defect on the next round.
Worse, the number of TfTs who will defect on the next round increases
every time a TfT who intends to cooperate plays against a Defector.  When
any number of Defectors play against x TfTs, all x of the TfTs will always
defect after x games between a TfT and a Defector in which the TfT
cooperates while the Defector defects. 

Anyway, this game is especially obvious in the version I originally
posted, the situation under which the prisoners, though known to each
other, will never play again.  In that case egoism absolutely demands that
both players defect; despite the fact that it results in suboptimal
consequences.

If A = B, then A^2 = A*B, so A^2 - A*B = 0.  Your jig is up, Mr. Presume! 
You have divided both sides by 0.  I hope John Clark wisely fires you.  :)

Title
  Post-prandial thermogenesis with ephedrine, caffeine and
  aspirin in lean, pre-disposed obese and obese women.
Source
  International Journal of Obesity & Related Metabolic Disorders.  20(2):91-7,
  1996 Feb.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not aspirin further potentiates the
  greater post-prandial thermogenesis induced by ephedrine
  with caffeine. DESIGN: Determination of the acute metabolic rate response to
  the following treatments: 1050 kJ liquid meal (M); meal plus
  ephedrine (30 mg) and caffeine (100 mg) (MEC) or meal plus
  ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin (300 mg) (MECA). SUBJECTS:
  Lean, pre-disposed obese and obese women (n = 10 each group). MEASUREMENTS:
  Pre- and post-treatment metabolic rate determinations via indirect
  calorimetry. Post-treatment measurements made at 20 min intervals for a total
  of 160 min. RESULTS: In all groups, metabolic rate increased significantly
  more following the MEC or MECA, compared to the meal only (p < 0.05). The
  obese group had a significantly greater absolute increase in metabolic rate
  following the MECA and MEC compared to both the lean and pre-disposed obese
  groups (p < 0.05). Metabolic rate remained elevated at the end of the 160 min
  following all treatments. CONCLUSION: Aspirin does not further potentiate the
  acute thermic effect of ephedrine and caffeine with a meal.
  However, the full thermogenic response was not measured and longer duration
  studies are necessary to confirm these results.

"Average Daily Nutrient Intake and Mood Among Obese Women"
Nutrition Research 18(7): 1103-1112 1998

Abstract:

   This study examined the relations between stable moods (i.e., non
clinical levels of anxiety and depression) and average daily intake of
certain macro- and micronutrients, among a sample of obese women. Subjects
were 38 women assessed at entry to a long-term weight-loss medication
trial. Subjects' levels of aanxiety and depression were assessed by
self-report measures and by a psychiatrist's ratings. Average daily intakes
of energy, macronutrients, certain micronutrients, and caffeine were
computer analyzed (Nutritionist III) from subjects' eating diaries. Results
were analyzed via Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regression
analyses. Higher carbohydrate (CHO) intake, particularly simple CHO intake,
was consistently related to lower levels of both anxiety and depression.
Some relations of mood to caffeine and micronutrients were also observed on
correlational analyses. Discussion examines possible explanations for
findings, particularly the surprisingly strong association between higher
intakes of simple CHO and lower levels of depression and anxiety.

Additional note by poster:

    Simple carbohydrate means sugars. No statistically significant relation
existed between complex carbohydrates, with the sugar grams removed and
mood. A slight benefit to higher dietary selenium intake was also detected.
Supplement use was not monitored.

No way.  I minored in biology and have too much genetic training to
claim that.  I was stating that the *attraction* was real.

I was refuting a prior claim that gay males really weren't interested in
other males, but were merely practicing on them so that they could get
enough experience to go get females.

My point was that gay males really prefer males.  It's not a second
choice because they can't get females, and it's not a secret strategy to
get more females.  Some males really do prefer other males.

Some people claim that killing the original biological copy is not
murder and does not result in death as long as an identical uploaded
copy exists.

If destroying the moving, thinking body is not murder or death, are
people claiming that this person is not alive?  If it is alive, how can
this life be terminated without calling it murder and death?  If it is
not alive, when did it used to be alived, when exactly did it cease to
be alive, and by what definition?

During one uploading scenario, the uploaded copy is made first and then
the original copy is destroyed.  Some people think that the destruction
of the first copy is murder.  Others think it is not as long as there is
an identical copy.

What is murder?  The deliberate causing of death.
What is death?  Herein lies the debate.

The former school thinks that the destruction of any viable person is
death.  Even if there are copies of a person, killing one of the copies
is death.  Currently, while we only have one body per person, or one
copy per person, this definition holds for everybody.

The latter school thinks that the destruction of the last copy of a
viable person is death.  If there are copies of a person, killing any of
the copies is OK as long as a single copy survives.  Currently, while we
only have one body per person, or one copy per person, this definition
holds for everybody.

When we achieve the ability to make identical copies of a person, which
defintion should hold?  I think this is the question before us.  Either
defintion is functional and seems universally accepted for now, because
both result in the same conclusions.  In the future, these theories will
diverge in their results and application.  How do we choose between
them?

The new question is, what is wrong with death and murder?  What
constitutes this bad thing we call "death" that we are trying to avoid?

I assume that the former school will say that the termination of any
living being is a death.  That being is determined to be alive if it
consciously thinks it is alive.  External data are irrelevent to the
question of whether someone is alive.  The person is inherently alive or
dead based on *their own* functioning.  If a person is alive, then to
terminate its functioning would be death, and an act of murder.

I assume that the latter school will say that termination of any
*unique* being is death.  That any being that has been copied may be
terminated as long as an identical copy still is viable.  That being is
determined to be alive if it can produce actions or data that are unique
and are not exactly reproduceable by another identical copy.  In this
case, *internal* data are irrelevent to the question of whether someone
is alive, and only a comparison to external persons will determine if
the person is alive.  The person is externally declared to be alive or
dead based on *other person's* functioning.  If the person is not
unique, and an exact copy is alive, then terminating its functioning
would not be death or an act of murder.

If you read my memories you would certainly have a subjective experience of

my  subjective experience?  If you don't want to exclude behavior then the

That part is certainly untrue, all the memories from my childhood could have

Actually, except when I'm arguing Philosophy on The Extropian List I seldom 
think about being conscious.

It didn't have to jump because if consciousness has a spatial location, which 
is doubtful, it's certainly not where the brain is but where the  senses are. 
The brain by itself has no way of detecting position, or time for that matter.

If you kill me instantly and without warning I'll never know I'm dead which 
is good but unless I have a copy I'll never know I'm alive either which is 
bad. If I do have a copy I still won't know I'm dead but I will know I'm  
alive exactly as I did before, I won't notice the slightest change. As I said,  
my definition of death is having a last thought and in this scenario they are  
absolutely continuos and have not even slowed down.

I think the basic difference is that I don't think I'm a noun, I'm not matter, 
I'm the complex way matter reacts when it is organized in a certain way. 
I think people are more like music than bricks.

Great thought experiment!  But I do not think anybody would object to
this procedure.  It is a red herring.  The objectionable procedure of
uploading involves taking a brain that is capable of conscious thought
and growth and destroying it.  Your example doesn't do that.  The
objectionable procedure takes a whole body and makes it cease to
function all at once.  Your example doesn't do that.  The objectionable
procedures requires the copy be made first, and then the total number of
living viable copies be reduced by one.  Your example doesn't do that.
Nothing in your example appears to be murder.

You haven't explained why the murderous-appearing part of uploading is
not really murder.  You created an example that lacks this facet, and
then declare that the problem isn't there.  In your example, you still
are the one-and-only biological human claiming to be you.  You have not
copies or moved your consciousness to another body.  This is a very
interesting example, but it is not an example of uploading of making
copies of consciousness.   Therefore, the example does not explain or
resolve any of the questions resulted therefrom.  (In my humble
opinion.)

As one of the major purveyors of the non-PC ideas you object to, I'd like
to make it clear that I have no expertise in the consensual-reality world
of psychology, and make no claims about what psychologists may or may not
agree upon this week.

I do enjoy dueling, but I suspect that we would each consider the other to
be an unarmed opponent....

I don't assume that gay males desire females, I used "normal" in above

instead.  Sorry....

How many of our genes came from males who never mated with a female?  Our
whole genetic sequence evolved bit by bit by providing a reproductive
advantage every step of the way.  If the so called "gay gene" is what we
think it is, it codes for a reproductive strategy that was, at the time it
was coded, successful.  Successful reproductive strategies for males all
involve mating with females....

Is this revelant?  There is no free lunch--every successful strategy that
evolves soon finds individuals competing in it.

I'm not sure I understand this objection.  The gay males don't have much
attraction for their female partners, so they tend to get their kicks on
the side (also, "going out with the boys" doesn't tend to arouse a jealous
reaction from one's spouse, so fooling around on the side is easier to get
away with for gays).  I didn't mean to imply that a lack of fidelity was
the downside to the stratedgy, it is the increased risk of disease that
accompanies it.

Gays tend to have more sex partners than straights, which entails a greater

There was a study that I read (which, if I didn't give away my books as
fast as I read them, I might be able to provide a reference to), which did
a historical analysis of the incidence of homosexuality in different
cultures.  The upshot (if I remember correctly) was that small isolated
societies tended to have high levels of homosexual activity (some >50%),
while societies that weren't isolated had much smaller rates.  This matched
what one would expect for a disease-limited strategy.

No, I am happy to assume that gays with the "gay gene" "really" prefer men
to women.  However, the fact that there is a genetic correlation means that
they must usually overcome their natural interest and mate with females
anyway....

Healthy cultures and wise parents both seek to back-up the inclinations
that nature provides with a dose of indoctrination.  The young gay male
would normally have it explained to him in no uncertain terms what the
requirements of manhood were, with the finding of a mate and the fathering
of children ranking high on this list.
 
As for gays who lack the "gay gene", who knows?  A different "gay gene"?  A
memetic code taking advantage of the same niche?  Guys "apeing" other guys
who have a successful stratedgy?  A genetic glitch?  Perhaps all of these,
and more.

I would say that the consciousness of "the person" resides equally in the
copy and in the upload (so long as they are synchronized; once they get
out of sync they are not the same, of course).  Hence stopping one of
them does not stop the consciousness of the person.

So in your example, I'd say that the body and brain is alive, but that
killing it does not kill the person, because the person encompasses more
than that body.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  The body that used to
be live, now has a bullet in its brain and is not alive.  But you don't
see a dead body.  Surely you are speaking metaphorically?  Surely you
agree that it is a dead body, but it's "OK"?

Mysticism Alert!  You seem to be saying that consciousness exists
outside of the physical body, outside space and time, and that space and
time and position and laws of physics don't apply to this ethereal
consciousness.  This allows a copy to be made, and for "you" to
instantly appear, faster-than-light, in a new location without really
moving.

Definition Change Alert!  Your definiton of "killing" and "death"
obviously are not based on any definition of "life" and "death" that
have existed until now.  Please clearly define these new definitions for
these words.  Until now, I have never heard that you can put a bullet
through someone's brain and not call it murder based on what thoughts
are inside their head.  Certainly this is not the usual definiton of
"killing"?

Circular Logic Alert!  This only works if you assume, as you do, that
both copies are "you" and that the new copy's thought is a continuation
of the original copy's thought.  If you assume, as I do, that the two
copies are two seperate but identical people, then your original copy
did have its last thought, while the new copy had its first original
thought.  This doesn't support what you believe, but merely states it.

By the very nature of circular logic relying on the pre-assumed beliefs,
I think that you and I can agree on your entire paragraph, but based on
our original belief come up with different conclusions.  This is why
these examples seem to go nowhere, because we both agree with the
examples in toto.  But the circular-logic in the example points to
pre-existing assumptions, wherein we differ, so each of us "proves" our
own point with the same circular-logic example.

Self-Referencing Evidence Alert!  Is there any way to test the original
to see if it is not dead?  Since the identity of the copy is at issue
here, it is not valid to reference it as proof as to what it is.  This
is like quoting the Bible to prove that it is the Word of God.  It is
self-referencing circular-logic.  We must be able to measure the
original to see if still continues.  If you wish to move the measuring
devices from location to another, you must first prove that by doing so
you are following and measuring the same thing as was originally
measured.  If you change the reference point in the middle without
reason, then there is no reason to think that both things being measured
are the same.

> I think the basic difference is that I don't think I'm a noun, I'm not matter,
> I'm the complex way matter reacts when it is organized in a certain way.
> I think people are more like music than bricks. 

Straw-man Alert!  You seem to assume that I and others who think as I do
are giving some significance to our specific atoms.  This is not
necessary for our objection.  I have seen numerous examples given here
to explain away the physical matter requirement.  I think that is a
straw-man position that you and others are projecting.  I haven't seen
anyone here claim it, and I certainly don't.

Platonic Mysticism Alert!  The question is whether two identical copies
of anything can exist.  You and others seem to say that they cannot, and
as soon as they become identical, they become one.  This is the old
Platonic Forms argument, that there is only one true form of every
object, and that all such instances are really the same object expressed
in different locations.  I and others do not believe in Plato's forms,
and if we see two people, we think they are two people.  No matter how
closely similar they become, the still are two people.  At no point do
they become so similar that the magically and instantly become one.

Sorry for all the "alerts!", but I'm trying to point out logical flaws.
I'm tired of the conversation going around and around and going nowhere.
So, I'm trying to be more specific about where logic flaws lay, or why a
specific belief is rejected, or where definitions are changing.  I hope
this will more directly analyze the problem and help the discussion move
along.

This all assumes that SIs are separate from us. One way to avoid this is
to form a symbiosis with them. This brings up other interesting issues,
such as bandwidth, and whether the symbiotic system would feel that the
human component is worth keeping around.

The bigger, faster, louder is better meme has been around for a long long
time.... If you take a dog, upload it and run it at 10^6 that of realtime,
you have a very fast dog, but it still is a dog. I think we have a lot to
learn before a SI becomes feasible.

I note these days with dour pleasure that the hardware has gotten so much
ahead of the software that most folks like 266 Mhz $1000 Wintel boxes so the
PC more (everything) to run (huger and huger) bloatware trend is less now.

Someone with better data that I have (John Clark?) might think about how many
machine cycles are equivalent to evolution of human beings from
archaeobacteria,
as this might provide a clue as to just how fast the hardware must be to
create
an SI from evolutionary principles. I sort of doubt it is less than say 10^50
operations....??

GargargarGAR! I would assume even a few 100 ms of realtime
neurodynamics would result in statespace trajectories of clones'
diverging sufficiently to classify termination of a single clone as
"murder". Of course I'm a purist, so sue me.

You didn't answer the question.  You said before you shoot it, the body
and brain are alive.  After you shoot it, are the body and brain still
alive?

Agreed. A dog is a dog is a dog, but a god is just a few exponential
steps off. If according evolutionary trajectory is kinetically
accessible: instant SI, just add ZOPS.

In terms of statespace velocity, the hardware has not progressed all that dramatically. 
The reason we _think_ the hardware has progressed so much beyond the
software is one of the current tradegies we have to live with. Why are 
people so intent on censoring their own worldview? Everything which
even distinctly smacks of von Neumann is wrong, Wrong, WRONG.

1) We're not archae, and we understand our hardware more or less
   thoroughly (or at least are just a few years off that stage). We
   don't have to retraverse all these GYrs.

2) we can write our fitness function. Nothing prevents us from
   starting off with realtime robotics and Turing test performance,
   while optimizing for SPEED.

3) evolution speed in EHW fitness space is nothing like precambrian
   ursoup simmering forever. Electronically excited Genotype2phenotype 
   generation iteration takes microseconds, not decades.

To sum it up, if we do it right, I think we have excellent chances to
leap beyond our current status quo in a few bounds. Let's.

No.  You keep thinking that if they didn't mate with females and produce
offspring, the gene would die out.  It wouldn't.  If it is indeed a
sex-linked gene on the X-chromosome inherited from the mother's side,
then boys with the gene could be gay (having only one X chromosome),
while girls with the gene would be carriers (having two X chromosomes).
Every generation would have males who don't reproduce, and females who
reproduce resulting in more gay males.  Such a gene would not die out,
even if none of the gay males ever reproduced.

	I agree with most of what you're saying, BUT, I think we are
all still dummies and completely missing the single most obvious and
important part of consciousness, uploading, and indeed, existence
itself.  And that is, what are all those atoms (or whatever it is that
our consciousness awareness is really made out of at the fundamental
level) phenomenally like?  For example, I know, first hand, what red
is fundamentally like.  I'm not talking about 700 nm light, I'm
talking about the conscious sensation our brain uses to consciously
represent 700 nm light.  Though the two can do a good job of
abstractly emulating or modeling each other the two are nothing at all
like each other at the fundamental level.  One is beyond our eyes, and
the other is inside our brain.  And to miss the significant difference
between the real thing and a mere abstract model or emulation that is
fundamentally completely different, is to miss the most important part
of our conscious existence.  Sure, a simple color detecting machine
can tell me what color something is better than I can, but what it
uses to represent this knowledge of color in its merely abstract brain
is nothing like the red and all the other "qualia" my brain uses to
represent those same wavelengths of light.

	Certainly the stuff of our consciousness must be fundamentally
based on atomic matter.  And just as one carbon atom is identical to
another, an identical configuration of atoms producing red (which my
brain uses to represent something reflecting 700 nm light) would
surely produce an indistinguishable sensation in another persons
brain. But, just because such identity theories most likely will still
hold for qualia, don't dismiss the most important part of our
conscious worlds: our feelings, our sensations, all of our conscious
knowledge, and what they are fundamentally and phenomenally like.
True, we can certainly abstractly model them with abstract machines,
given enough complexity, just as a simple color detecting machine can
model color, but the two representations are nothing at all
fundamentally like each other.

	Since we know, only abstractly to date I might add, all that
can be known about the mechanical causes and effects of 700 nm light
and the way it reflects off of various material, we think we know
everything about red.  But this abstract knowledge of the cause and
effect of light reflection has nothing to do with the conscious
phenomenon our brain finally produces to represent such reflections of
certain wavelengths of light.  One is the initial cause of the
abstract cause and effect perception process, the other is the final
result.  One is beyond the eye, the other is in the brain.  One is a
mere physical object of abstract detection and the other is a
gloriously phenomenal experience.  One is something, the other is,
though a gloriously phenomenal and beautiful something, a mere
abstract knowledge or a model of it.

	All we currently know of stuff beyond our senses is abstract,
cause and effect, information that our senses model.  We simply
abstractly know how things interact.  We know nothing of what such
physical phenomenon is really like.  But we do know, first hand, what
red is like.  A sunset, isn't really "beautiful".  As far as we now
know, it is simply an abstract mechanical cause and effect process
that stimulates our senses and scientific instruments according to our
mere abstract laws of physics.  Since we only know of it in the
abstract it can't be beautiful.  For beauty is the gloriously
phenomenal representation of the sunset that our brain produces from
the abstract data received, or our conscious knowledge of the sunset.
Why are we such dummies and always completely miss or dismiss such
plain, obvious, and necessary facts?  Why are we such dummies that
mistakenly give all the glory to something that doesn't yet really
deserve it and entirely dismiss the true phenomenon that really
deserve all the recognition?

	We think the glorious world of our perception, that is our
conscious knowledge, is out beyond our senses.  Because we abstractly
know much of the cause and effect of what is beyond our eyes we
thereby think we know everything of our conscious knowledge of it.
But, again, this is to miss the most important and glorious fact of
reality itself; and that is, the phenomenally glorious stuff of which
our conscious awareness is fundamentally made of, and how it
currently, at best, can only abstractly represent or model anything
beyond our senses.

	Once people finally realize that red is something in their
brain, not something out beyond their eyes, and that the most
important thing about all of reality is the phenomenal worlds (which
are in or produced by our brains) we use to represent the reality
beyond our senses they will forever selfishly wonder why we could be
such dummies and so quickly dismiss or so completely miss the most
glorious and phenomenal part of all of reality.  I selfishly want the
red that is in my head!  I like to call the worlds of our conscious
knowledge, which are constructed out of qualia stuff by our brains,
spirit worlds.  Don't give me no stinking merely abstract cause and
effect representation like that beyond my eyes!  It's nothing at all
like it!

	Until we realize the significance of this difference and it's
fundamental importance, we will be dummies indeed.  We will continue
to fail at our science, in our attempts to understand what we really
are and what it really means to be uploaded and what we will be able
to become and do.  Until we understand this, we will only know
abstractly of the world beyond our senses, and not realize that we
might be able to know, first hand, what the rest of the world outside
our brain is really fundamentally and phenomenally "like".

I think the whole premise of most of these endless uploading discussions
is ill conceived.  They focus on the scenario where you have been ripped
from your current world and thrust into a future uploading sales room,
where the slick-talking salesperson is pitching their upload copying 
service, and all you have to go on is some abstract philosophical 
analysis of dozens of strange transformation scenarios, where in each 
case you need to answer "but is it me?"  It's Socrates in the Twilight Zone.

Come the day when you actually have such a choice to make, I don't think
such philosophy will matter much.  You'll be embedded in a whole social
world to help inform your decision.  You'll be able to talk to uploads 
and their copies, and read articles about their experiences.  You might
well know friends and relatives who've tried it.  You'll have consumer 
reports type evaluations.  You'll have reasonable expectations about how
much fun it is to be an upload, how much pain they suffer, the economic
rewards possible to uploads, and the social penalties they suffer.  And 
you'll have a reasonable idea of the rewards and penalties to you from
creating such a creature.  

Given all this context, I think the self-centered question "is it me?" 
will fade relative to the parent's question "will the creature I create 
have a good life?"  How will I feel about creating such a creature, trading 
off parental positives I feel against the trouble of being such a "parent", 
and the costs this new creature might impose on the other creatures I've 
created?  Will it get along with its siblings or fight with them?  
Will it take resources away from them, or provide them with needed supports?
Do I have to devote decades of my time to effort to "raise" this new 
creature, or is a few days work enough?  How much do I like being around
such creatures?  Do then enhance my social world, or make it more trouble?

Given the range of feelings out there about the value of creating new 
creatures, when the joy of a life outweighs the sorrows, how much we like
being around people like ourselves, even about "is it me?", it seems obvious 
to me that *some* people will choose to be uploads.  And given that some do, 
I think that, using our best understanding of people and social systems,
we can say a lot about all these factors that will influence the choice to
"parent" an upload copy.

This seems like the interesting question to me: assuming many people
choose to make uploads and upload copies, what will life be like for such
uploads, and for those that don't choose to make copies?  The answer to 
this question will be a much better basis for choosing to make a copy than
"is it me?"  

(I made an initial stab at such analysis years ago with my article
 http://hanson.berkeley.edu/uploads.html, but there's lots more to do.)

Harvey Newstrom vs. United Utilitarians PPL

Joe Jenkins:  Bills, Bills, Bills, why else would the System
Administrator of my Universe Simulation Provider be sending me email?

Sys Admin:  Greetings valued customer.  I am happy to offer you an
opportunity for a 20% discount on our regular rates for one year
realtime/1000 years subjective.   This is due to the pending frivolous
lawsuit Harvey Newstrom vs United Utilitarians PPL.  Our original
contract that allows us to discontinue dual redundancy after no
recorded errors for 1 year realtime is being called into question by
said litigation.  We are temporarily required to halt all such
discontinuance's pending the outcome.  We have found a loophole that
works around this problem.  To receive the discount you have the
following 2 options:
1. Switch from your current United Utilitarians PPL to Consolodated
Egoist PPL.
2. Participate in a realtime dialog with me for what has been
estimated to be 10 minutes realtime.  15 days of subjective time will
credited to your account.  For legal and technical reasons, no
multiplexing is allowed.  Your process will be slowed to realtime for
10 minutes.  The outcome of our dialog will determine if you are
eligible for the discount.  So far, all participants have succeeded in
receiving the discount.  Warning, if you are a paranoid Schitzo like
Harvey Newstrom, don't bother.

Joe Jenkins:  WOW 20% off for 1000 years, I could party like its 2999.
 If I remember right, Consumer Reporter Daniel Fabulich's estimates on
the projected long term cost of switching to Consolidated Egoist PPL
from United Utilitarians PPL was a lot more than my savings would be -
so forget that option.  I guess I'll have to arrange for a 15-day
vacation.

Sys Admin:  Welcome to realtime Mr. Jenkins.   As a 1000x upload I
realize this 10 minutes realtime comes at a great expense to you so
I'll get right to the point.  After over a year of runtime, our
diagnostics show that your dual redundant strings have not even
produced a single bit error.  Our original contract that allows us to
discontinue/terminate the redundancy after satisfying this requirement
has been rejected by our insurance company pending the outcome of
Harvey Newstrom vs United Utilitarians PPL.  Although, in your
original contract you stipulated avoiding upload copy divergence at
all cost, we would require your redundant string to diverge for 5
minutes to allow separate dialogs from your two strings.  We presume
that the rational choice of one of your strings would be to
voluntarily terminate.  That way we would put to rest our insurance
companies concern of a possible wrongful death case as in the current
litigation.  Do you have any questions at this time?

Joe Jenkins:  Why cant I just give you permission to terminate one of
my dual redundant strings.

Sys Admin:  You've already done that in your contract.  Reiterating
that will not satisfy the insurance company.

Joe Jenkins:  This is preposterous.  My dual redundant string has the
same sensor/effector data on both sides of the string.  Everything I
see, hear, or feel is identical on both sides.  Even the pseudo-random
generators are running in sync and producing the same results. 
Everything I experience and do are identical on both strings.  They
are only both there in case of an error.  You said yourself the two
strings have not disagreed on a single bit for my entire runtime.  I
really don't like the idea of allowing a divergence.  
      Of course, there was that hang-gliding accident before my
upload.  Luckily, that was after we had the technology for
non-destructive full brain scan for backup purposes.  But it had been
a full month since my last backup.  24 hours after my accident I found
myself as an upload.  The procedure was fully funded by my life
insurance company.  That was great because I had wanted to upload for
months but couldn't afford it.  On the downside, a full month of my
life before the accident was completely lost.  Well at least my memory
of it, the rest of the world seemed to still be firmly attached to
that month.  I met a couple of people who claimed to be good friends
of mine, but I never even remembered meeting them.  One of them turned
out to be a scam artist who I really had never met.  He read about my
accident in the news and decided to try to profit from it.  After
filling me in on our friendship, he hit me up for a $500 loan.  Since
then I've learned to trust but verify claims about this one month
period in my life.  I received a few sympathy cards from friends and
family about the loss I had experienced.  This was a little bit
overkill from my perspective though.  I felt alive and well minus a
few inconveniences about the lost month.
       Now your saying that I should let two copies of myself diverge
by letting them be executed on a different processor with different
sensor/effector data.  That will result in Joe Jenkins String 1 and
Joe Jenkins String 2 sitting across the room from each other.  After a
couple of minutes of divergence, you'll ask Joe Jenkins String 2 to
voluntarily terminate execution.  This sounds acceptable to me.  Let's
start the procedure.

Sys Admin:  Okay, I'll be halting your process long enough to load
each redundant string to its own processor.  Do I have your permission
for an estimated 5 ms realtime stasis.

Joe Jenkins:  No poblemo.

Sys Admin:  Welcome Joe Jenkins String 1 and Joe Jenkins String 2. 
You are now running separately. Joe Jenkins String 2, you have been
provided with a red button on the arm of your chair.  Lifting the
spring loaded bumper shield and pressing this button will permanently
terminate your process and erase all of your data.  For legal reasons,
you must press this button yourself with no help from Joe Jenkins
String 1 or me.  You may proceed.

Joe Jenkins String 2:  In order to verify the proper functioning of
string 1, I would like to have a private conversation with him.  I
appreciate Mr. Sys Admin leaving the room so that string 1 could
enumerate a few passwords and answer a few questions only he would know.

 Joe Jenkins String 1: Well number 2 since your are nearly identical
to me, I think I know what you are going to say, but I can only
imagine what its like to be in your situation.  Now that your
sensor/effector data is different from mine, I bet that effected the
seeds of your pseudo-random number generators enough that they are
giving different results.  So I'm sure you'll give me some surprises
here and there.

Joe Jenkins String 2:  Hello number 1, let me tell you how it feels
from my perspective  - They made a backup of me 5 minutes ago and now
they would like to terminate my execution and reinstate the backup.  
Well this is almost exactly the same as the hang-gliding accident. 
The only difference is that the backup is being run right now instead
of being in stasis and instead of losing 1 month, I'll be losing less
than five minutes.  Losing the one month wasn't all that bad but I
would certainly never do it voluntarily - maybe for a price.  Now I'm
faced with the fact that there will be two divergent processes of me
if I refuse to push the button.  This is a high price to pay.  Where
as, If I do push the button I loose 5 minutes of nothing special but I
gain my 20% discount.  That settles it.  Asta la Vista baby.

1) The "don't know who your opponent is" condition is irrelevant;
consistent identity is /not/ required for egoism to produce good
results in an iterated situation.  It is not even strictly
necessary for your opponent to know who you are, either, so long
as each prospective opponent has /some/ information about you or
a group to which you belong that might influence him; something
like a reputation for honesty among men in a certain profession,
for example, is enough to give an egoist positive value in
maintaining that reputation in dealing with anonymous others.

2) That "20%" speculation of yours is absurd in the real world.
In my 35 years on the planet, I have yet to encounter a single
situation where my interaction with someone else would not have
consequences later in life.  For me, then, the percentage of
non-iterated prisoner's dilemma situations in real life is zero.
I'd like to hear a convincing example of such a situation, but
even if one or two could be contrived--just as I'm sure I could
contrive an example or two of utilitarian atrocities--one should
live by principles that reflect how life is in general, not by
contrived examples.

But it is about us.  The current discussion on uploads is not about
creating offspring, but extending our current lifespan beyond that of
our bodies.  Since most copy advocates require that the original body be
destroyed during the process, we really need to figure out whether it
will be life extension or instant death.  This is not a question that
can be put off until after we pull the trigger.

We need to know if uploading as described will make us live forever, or
instantly kill us for trying.  This is more than a vague philosophical
question of "if I changed, am I really me".

I think you are looking at copies as if they are offspring.  In such a
scenario, I agree that it is unnecessary to discuss how much like us the
offspring will be.

I think the problem is that chip speed is not the limiting factor for
most computers.  Bus speeds, disk speeds, network speeds can't keep up
with the chip.  Faster chips won't make Microsoft Word run faster, won't
make a web page load faster, won't make an e-mail arrive faster.

No, after you shoot it, the body and brain is not still alive.  However
the person is still alive.

As a somewhat misleading analogy, we could say that a person's finger
is alive, and if you cut it off, it is not still alive, but the person
is still alive.  A better example, based on my earlier discussion, is
that a program is running on a redundant system, and when you eliminate
part of the redundancy, the program continues to run.

Interesting you should say this.  A number of years ago NASA was playing around with remote-controlled
'robots' that had an anthropomorphic upper body, including 2 cameras for eyes, and 2 mikes for ears.  A person
could wear a device on the other side of the room and control its head movement, arms etc via a 'virtual-reality'
like connection.

The person wearing the controller stated it was the weirdest sensation he'd ever felt - he saw himself sitting
across the other side of the room, and said it was almost like an out-of-body experience. He felt like he was
outside his own body.

So, we could perhaps assert that the conscious experience was taking place outside his own body.  However,
the processing necessary to produce this experience was still firmly rooted in his own body.

It's not egoism that is wrong. You can't blame anyone for being an egoist. It's the prisoner's dilemma that should be avoided. In real world situations you often have some control over the rules of the game. If you choose a system (economical, social, political, etc.) based on ill-formed game theories, you'll get what you ask for.

Or as Sun Tzu put it:
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."

I think this needlessly focuses on one not terribly typical scenario.
The earliest uploads will likely be cryonics patients, without much 
hope of getting a regular body anytime soon.  When uploading tech is 
mature, making an upload copy of a flesh brain probably *won't* require
destroying that flesh brain.  And making a copy of an upload brain 
probably will never require destroying the original (though that may
be cheaper sometimes).  It's only in the early but not earliest upload 
tech era regarding meat to metal transitions when the issue might even 
arise.

I mainly want to point out that not only is there a lot of slop in 
deciding "is it a change me or a similar someone else", but even when you
decide "someone else", you may still be willing to sacrifice a lot to 
create that someone else.  Maybe even "die".  When uploading is possible, 
many people *will* do it.  Can't we get past this endless agonizing over 
who will do it, and wonder what their world will be like?

[I'm not sure whether this has already made it to the list as I 
accidentally deleted some of my mail.]
====

I've just slightly modified Greg's arrrangement and added questions 
about transhumanist art, the singularity, uploading, and a few 
more suggested by Michael Nielsen (environment, dangers, 
superintelligence). We can still change the format later. I suggest 
we focus on one section at a time. (Those who have already made 
suggestions for suitable answers may want to repeat them since it 
would be convenient to have all anwers to one question on the same 
thread.)

Remember, both quotable one-liners and full answers are useful. (And 
I assume that everything posted on this thread becomes our common 
intellectual property that we can all cut and paste and use at will.)

GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSHUMANISM

What is transhumanism?

Transhumanism is the philosophy which advocates the use of technology
to overcome our biological limitations and transform the human
condition. The accelerating pace of technological development opens up
such revolutionary prospects as superhuman artificial intelligence and
molecular nanotechnology. The consequences of these developments may
include: the biochemical enrichment or redesign of our
pleasure-centres so we enjoy a richer diversity of emotions, life-long
happiness and exhilarating peak experiences every day; the elimination
of ageing; the abolition of disease; and perhaps the gradual
replacement of human bodies with synthetic enhancements and computers.
Or by contrast, it could mean that intelligent life will go extinct.
These are extreme possibilities. Yet they are taken seriously by an
increasing number of scientists and scientifically-literate
philosophers.


What is a posthuman?

A posthuman is a human successor that has been transformed and 
augmented to such a degree as to be no longer a mere human. 
Posthumans could be completely synthetic or they could be the result 
of extending a biological human's capacities with many partial 
augmentations. In either case, a posthuman would be a "higher" 
life-form than humans, in the same sense as a human could be 
said to be higher than an ape. More specifically, this means that a 
posthuman may have a greatly expanded intellect and memory; 
an indefinite life-span; the ability to choose its own mental states 
and emotions. Also exosomatic ("outside-the-body") improvements 
count, such as rapid access to databases or networks containing huge 
landscapes of ideas and information; high-bandwidth communication 
links with other posthumans (almost like a computing network); and 
advanced manufactuing technologies for building physical structures.
	Most transhumanists think it is impossible to fully imagine what 
posthumans would do or what it would be like be a posthuman -- just 
as non-human primates cannot begin fathom the complexity of
human affairs.

I just thought of an alternate ending to my last post.



Joe Jenkins String 1:  Wait!  Wait!  I know the issue here is only a
matter of losing 5 minutes.  But now that I think about it, your 5
minutes has been much more of an experience than mine.  I think it
would be beneficial to remember the feeling you were having just
before you were about to push the button.

this in the wastland of realtime when you could be back at 1000x by

have to agree my 5 minutes has been more of a learning experience than
yours so I'll go along with this crazyness.  Go ahead and push your

Joe Jenkins String 1:  Okay here goes .....

Joe Jenkins String 2:  Wait! Wait!  Now your few minutes has been more
valuable because you've experienced the feeling just before hitting
the button plus the experience of what it feels like to make the
suggestion that you take the plunge instead of me when I was perfectly
willing to do the dirty deed.  

Joe Jenkins String 1:  Okay, Go ahead and push your button.

Hmm, maybe there is a third question in this debate, what is suicide?  If
you ask the uploaded entity, "Did you kill yourself?" I'm guessing that
you'd get the answer, "No", but it would be diffucult to ignore the rather
obvious pool of protoplasm on the floor. ;-)

Unless some sort of destructive scanning technique is used (a'la Star Trek
(I know, I know, filled with bad science and un-extropian ideas)).

I personally find the idea that Star Trek, has, over the years, portrayed
thousands of suicides, vaguely amusing.

My personal favorite scenario is that the SI results from a hunman/computer
collaboration. Thus, the SI starts in symbiosis with at least one human.
I don't know what happens shortly thereafter. The most likely scenario IMO
Is an explosive growth phase based on adding computer capacity (via the net)
without adding additional humans. Note that this is SI singular, not SI
plural, even if multiple humans are involved. At some point, the SI may
choose to add more humans, either volunteers or draftees, and grant some
level of autonomous identity, less than, equal to, or greater than we have
now. However, it's IMO impossible to assign a probability to any action the
SI may choose to take that isn't precluded by the laws of physics. That's
why I'm very interested in prognostications up to the advent of the SI, and
relatively uninterested in the post-SI era.

So here's what it boils down to.  You can't think of a single situation in
which you could hurt someone for your own long term profit.

Unfortunately, there are lots.  Any and all situations in which you could
commit a crime against a victim (ie theft, fraud, murder, etc.) and not
get caught are examples for my argument.  If you steal and no one finds
out who it was, you have hurt someone for your own long term profit; if we
exploited all such situations, indeed, even sought out these sitautions as
egoism demands, we would all find ourselves worse off.

Another perfect example: tax credits for special interests.  This moronic
practice drags down the economy and makes everybody worse off in the long
run, but any individual special interest would be worse off
if they chose not to lobby Congress for its extra break.  Only when
OTHERS choose not to take special tax credits am I made better off; since
only I get to determine my choice, egoism demands that I choose to get a
tax credit, despite the fact that it hurts others more than it benefits
me.

If you can't think of at least fifty other ways in which you could hurt
people for your own gain, you're just not thinking hard enough.

I think you have the conditions wrong.  While I, too, recall reading that
Tit-for-X-Tats strategies would often compare favorably w/ TfT, sometimes
even beating it, the point is moot when TfT is surrounded by TfXTs: they
will all just cooperate all the time.

I'll take a look.  Any idea what the article was called?  Some keyword I

Er, no kidding.  I'm well aware of what a good idea it is to minimize the
number of situations in which it is profitable in the long term to hurt
others.  However, we can only minimize this effect; we can never eliminate
it entirely.  (No utopia, remember?)  In the meantime, we will still be
better off to the extent that people are utilitarians rather than egoists.

Title
  [Cholesterol-lowering effect of
  oat]. [Norwegian]

Abstract
  Use of oat-supplement has been advocated to reduce serum
  cholesterol concentration. In order to study the
  effect of a daily dietary supplement of
  oats on lipid levels we performed three controlled clinical
  trials in healthy Norwegians and patients with hypercholesterolemia.
  The studies lasted 3-5 weeks, and oats were
  added to the diet in bread, breakfast cereals, porridge or
  crispbread. The serum cholesterol concentrations were
  reduced by 2.5-5% in four of the five groups with an
  oat-supplemented diet. No effect was found
  in the group who ate crispbread. Lipid levels remained
  unchanged in the three control groups. We conclude that
  oat products have a small but significant
  cholesterol-lowering effect when given as a
  supplement to the ordinary Norwegian diet.

  We agree that the best known strategy in both egoism and
utilitarianism is tit for tat in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. These
are both "nice" strategies. Not the nicest possible, but pretty high
up there. Now, when we switch to non-iterated Prisoner's Dilemma you
contend that Mr. Ulitarian becomes the nicest of saints (always
cooperate) and Mr. Egoist becomes the meanest of devils (always
defect). I am now hallucinating major red flags being raised all 
around me. I tend to put egoism in a category close to greed and it's
been my experience that greed is compatible with utiltarianism. No, I
wasn't infected by Aristotle's virus, but a certain David Freeman
managed to pass a couple of infections that whizzed right by my immune
system. It is my suspicion that Mr. Egoist and Mr.Ulitarian may not be
ready to concede to such simple strategies after returning from the
drawing board.
  Maybe the strategies for non-iterated Prisoner's Dilemma need to be
much more complex than iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma allows simple strategies to find an Evolutionarily
Stable System because they don't all find themselves quickly defecting
on every move. For non-iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we need to be more
witty. Let me propose an example strategy: Our participant carries a
psuedo-random number generator and starts the game cooperating 50% and
defecting 50%. Every 10 iterations, the population is analyzed for
percentage of defectors and our original 50/50 split is adjusted
appropriately to match the population. If anyone knows about the
existence of or is inclined to write this simple program, I would be
interested to play some games with this and some other strategies I
have in mind.

I don't have enough data to be sure that this is the case.  Let's assume 
you're right, for the sake of argument.  Then a reasonable 
statistical hypothesis would seem to be that Western women, at this point 
in history, have damn good reasons to be interested in gender issues -- 
because policies on those issues are in a state of flux, which may, if 
handled right, give those women greater opportunity to increase their 
extropy.

On what basis do you draw that conclusion?  In fact, could you explain 
what you mean, there;  what does "relevantly overpresented" mean? Do you 
mean "relatively over-represented"?

Well, of course it's relevant to the list.  Discrimination on the 
basis of gender or sexuality (or anything else) which results in people 
being "kept down" _unfairly_ certainly minimizes their extropy.  I'll 
agree that the gun debate is rather beside-the-point, though.

My copy of the post by harv@gate.net (Harvey Newstrom) said the following:
                    
        >Mysticism Alert!  You seem to be saying that consciousness exists        
        >outside of the physical body, outside space and time, and that space         
        >and time and position. 
                

Apparently in your theory it's possible to measure consciousness by the cubic 
inch, I admit my theory doesn't have that feature but it does have other 
advantages. According to your theory the space-time coordinates of a brain 
are important in differentiating one consciousness from another, but I don't
see how that  could be true. You argue that two identical brains somehow 
produce different subjectivity because the brains are in different positions, 
but a brain without senses can't detect it's position. A brain can't detect 
time either, I could speed up or slow down your brain as much as I wanted, 
I could even  stop it for a billion years and you would never notice. A brain
without senses can't detect anything.                     

Sensations can certainly change subjectivity however, so the space-time  
position of the sense input is of paramount importance, but the position of 
the brain is totally irrelevant unless the brain is so far from the senses 
that time delays start to become  important. An Upload might not know or care
where his brain was, it could be distributed in thousands of computers all 
over the planet. On the other hand, he would be very interested where and 
when his  senses were.

Let me ask you a question, if you're right and I'm wrong then why don't you 
feel like your consciousness is trapped inside a small container made of bone?
                

        >and laws of physics don't apply to this ethereal consciousness. 
                
I most certainly never said that.
                

        >Definition Change Alert!  Your definiton of "killing" and "death"

Obviously. Ideas about life and death and identity and immorality that have 
served us well for a very long time are nearing the end of their useful life. 
The new element in the mix is Nanotechnology and the ability to make exact 
copies of complex objects.         

I think there's a tendency for people to say that uploading and self 
duplication is not possible because if they  were things would be odd, not 
illogical, not self contradictory, just odd. Well of course it would be odd,
these things are not in any of our experience, yet, so how could they be 
anything but peculiar? Nature will be the way it wants to be and it doesn't 
give a hoot in hell if late 20th century human beings think it's odd or not. 
Someday we'll have to confront fundamental facts about our existence that few 
of us have thought about and most just assumed to be the natural order of 
things, but it's important to remember that as long as something does not 
violate the laws of logic or physics it can not be ruled out just because 
it's odd.

I can't respond to that because I don't understand it. Two identical people 
producing two identical consciousness that are nevertheless completely  
different and thereby distinguishable by the identical consciousness  
themselves? I don't get it, are they identical or are they not?

I don't know who "the original" is and the entire concept is fuzzy but I'll  
tell you one thing, the only answer I ever get to my question is "no I'm not 
dead".

You have not explicitly made such a claim but if you're right then the

You seem to refuse to use the word "dead".  Someone asked what the dead
body was if the person didn't die.  You said there was no dead body.
You still refuse to use the word "dead".  Please define your test of
whether a person is dead or alive.  Current medical tests would fail to
find your person alive.  Current medical tests would declare your person
dead.  Until you can give a new definition for a new use of these terms,
it is difficult to follow your explanations.

The above example of "logic" is based on CIRCULAR LOGIC.  Your
conclusion can only be read out of these sentences if you already
believe your conclusion.  For those of us who do not believe your
conclusion, your above sentences are irrational and illogical.

For someone who does not hold your conclusion as accurate, your
statement above reads thusly:  "A program called #1 is running on a
system while a redundant program called #2 is running on a redundant
system, and when you eliminate program #1 by removing its hardware
platform, you will see that program #2 is still running, and by renaming
program #2 to now be called program #1, you will see that program #1
remains unaffected by its hardware shutdown."

I'd rather not see transhumanity written up in 2055, with a headline
something like 'Mesopotamia Dried Up -- Transhumanity Too" or "Like the
Romans Patricians, Transhumanity Slept While The SIs Arrived."   It wasn't
a lack of creativity that caused the fall of certain societies, but a lack
of good strategies in dealing with possible future outcomes of
technologies.  (-- an ecological impact plan.)

I've had to deal with the residue of slavery in the South, and getting a
right to vote.  I really can't fathom performing like a "fast minded dog"
serving coffee to a SI.  I'd rather the Si's internal society (of mind)
agents (as an option for a SI profiling) at least delve into my mind agents
and function symbiotically, or at least intuitively.

Almost none of your comments seem to be in response to my comments.  You
seem to be arguing with a straw-man position that has nothing to do with
my position.  I think that is why this conversation isn't getting
anywhere.

If what you say you were thinking matches what

Any *particular* consciousness *must* have a

Not position, yes, but I can order my memories

Really?  You're keener than most.  The Egyptians felt their consciousness
in their livers, for example.  Or did you mean to say that you happen to
KNOW that your consciousness resides in the brain, but don't actually
*feel* that?

Sorry that this is a bit off topic (It *does* have the word DNA in it, plus
it's really libertarian in nature of which I know there are many on this
list)

A major national current affairs program run on our government owned
national broadcaster (ABC), The 7:30 Report (16 July 98) tonight contained
the most alarming news I've heard in a long time.

You know those blood test things they do with the baby's feet at birth here
in Australia ?  (and probably everywhere else in the Western world)

We've just found out that the government have kept them all.
They now have 5 million.  (We have a population of only 18 - 20 million)

- They are providing them to law enforcement officials on request. (That
didn't take long !)

- At the time they did the test on my kids, I asked if they were kept and
told NO. There isn't a hope in hell I'd agree otherwise, and it looked so
suspicious at the time that I asked on at least two occasions about this.

- They are being used in genetic experimentation, testing and for detailed
genetic analysis. These are NOT anonymous samples. They contain our kids
identity information. I think the audience on the extropian list would
realise
the implications of someone somewhere having a database record containing
information about your genome attached to your name. Insurance companies
would love this information - they'd know how to set your premium,
especially if the analysis had already been done for them and was included
in the file.

- Seen/read Gattica, 1984, Brave New World etc ? If you're
wondering what sort of infrastructure is required before that future can
arrive, I'll let you know the very first one - genetic imprints of all
citizens at birth.

I've started a mailing list that I'll use to promote awareness about this.
Send an email to genethics-request@list.to with the word SUBSCRIBE in the
message body.  This internet discussion group will aim to provide a forum
where concerned parents can work towards getting our kids DNA back.

This message is being circulated widely on the internet.  There is going to
be some real people power on a genetic issue for the first time in
Australian politics.

At least they could get a good robot body. That's already possible 
today. What more can anybody possibly ask for than a pair of 
vidoecameras to see with, a pair of microphones to hear with, and a 
set of hydraulic limbs to move around with?     ;-)

Anyway, I don't think that uploading will be possible until we have 
mature nanotechnology and by then it might also be possible to 
manufacture human bodies (though it's a difficult task).

Oh, I think I could use a 10 GFlop CPU with current generation's 
800 MByte/s memory bandwidth just fine (for QM, MD). Bus speed is 
a bottleneck? Agreed. Let's kill the motherboard, move the bus 
onto die, so you could make it few kBit wide, and run at several 
GHz. Disk speed is a bottleneck? Let's go totally solid state, or 
holooptical. Network too slow? Go GBit/s, and beyond (just now you 
can't feed even GBit Ethernet). If this is still insufficent, go 
analog FPGA WSI. Or molecular circuitry.

Yes, and we will saturate each new resource generation easily. Current 
high end PCs are way insufficient for robust realtime speech input,
not even mentioning vision. Their neural DSP performance is pathetic.
And complex VR simulation games can absorb essentially infinite
resources as can household robotics. And likewise for x, y, z.

The argument 'nobody needs that much power' is recurring
periodically. This hadn't occured in the past, this won't occur in the 
future. And thanks god, for it keeps life being interesting.

Yes, perhaps we should should start writing blightlets for the global
networks of now and the near future -- this should steel our networks
against spontaneously emerged and deliberately constructed perversion 
attacks, and make people aware of what might be coming. Human tiger 
teams, so to speak. Of course we should take care not to trigger the 
Big One by mistake. Little danger for it just now....

I think the emergence of SI is always singular, because it overruns
the existing substrate dish so rapidly leaving no chance to its
spontaneously emerged competitor. Though we don't now how first
autoreplicators emerged in the prebiological ursoup, I think they
might have spread as fulminantly after nucleation.

 > choose to add more humans, either volunteers or draftees, and grant some

It could grow way more rapidly by autoreplication. There is little
variation between human specimens, so just a small sample would
seem to suffice, and entire world knowledge will be online by then. 
(Not that I think a mere cubic meter of quantum dots will be ever 
prone to a bit of artistic crisis).

Yes, it's a glass darkly. But speculation is fun!

I believe that if/when uploading becomes feasible, few will be interested if
it means the destruction of the original because they will not be convinced
that it will "still be them".   It'll be a different story once uploading
without destroying the original is perfected.  However, for those pioneering
few who choose to allow themselves to be destroyed in the process of
uploading, the question "Will I survive?" becomes entirely moot.  We are no
more likely to determine the answer to this question than we are to
determine the existence of god.  It's a waste of time to ponder whether the
original identity survives "as" the dupicate.  The facts are that the
original is gone and we will never know.

I agree with Robin Hanson who suggested that not enough consideration is
being given to the perspective of the uploaded entity.  I would be concerned
with how the copy would cope with all this.  Assuming they're uploaded with
the same emotional proclivities as the original, how would they deal with
the feelings of doubt and guilt as they question the very validity and
meaningfulness of their existence?  Yes, you would feel just like the
original, BUT you would also know that you could never truly know whether
you are deluded or not.  In addition, how comfortable would others be
interacting with you now.  In the early days of uploading, I imagine most
people will think of you as "not the real thing. . .but an amazing
simulation".  How will this effect your successful adaptation to your
environment?  Will your family and friends grieve the loss of the original
or really accept you "as" him.  There's a great potential for isolation,
depression, anxiety, etc.  As Robin indicated, these matters are more
salient and meaningful than debates over the unknowable (I hope I'm not
mis-characterizing your comments, Robin).

This brings to mind my earlier post on personality enhancements.  If I were
being forced to undergo uploading (for some reason), I would anticipate the
potential problems of me or my copy (whichever) emotionally handling the
transition and if possible try to minimize the trauma by arranging to have
my emotional intelligence enhanced/optimized in preparation.

Why should they want to get bodies? Apart from intrinsically higher
and drastically cheaper diversity in artificial reality, a Dysonian 
computer cluster or a Jupiter brain is not a suitable environment 
for any classical body. Why limiting oneself to human senses if I 
can utilize anything from proximal probe over accelerometry, 
magnetometry, MS, particle detectors, inteferometry arrays, &c&c? 
Exercise your own imagination on the motorics part. But, once again, 
if the material realm of a stellar system is entirely under your 
control, maxing out on computation while keeping the number of 
resources allocated to sensomotorics at an absolute mininimum (in a
pinch, you could always reuse these atoms in new configurations albeit 
at a time penalty and resources wasted in dormant basal autoreplicator 
capability) is obviously a good strategy. Only coevolution-artefacted
nonlinearities would seem to disturb the Brave New Postmaterial 
world scheme. (Of course, as this is way PostSingularity, we're off 
exploring the Neverneverextrapolation-land again. Pray don't knock 
down the lametta, the ultraviolet bunnies hate that).

Thank you, I'd rather be a cluster of active-orbit-controlled 
boxes in high solar orbit swinging around my own gravitation center,
while other parts of me are busily processing our stellar
neighbourhood. (Of course there will be probably no 'me', just a memetic 
bouillabaisse (sp?) virtually swirling in diverse bitbuckets of multiple 
shapes and sizes).

Nanotechnology strong enough to allow autoreplication by
mechanosynthesis is actually unnecessary for uploading, in a pinch we
could settle with vanilla molecular circuitry/macroscopic autoreplicators.
Since the plumbing layer is not visible in artificial reality, this
should not concern us too much (but it would be less pretty, agreed).
See Joe Strout's pages for details.

 > manufacture human bodies (though it's a difficult task).

If drextech is feasible, a way of producing living tissue and whole
living critters would seem to build a beasty in vitrified state around 
a fractal diamondoid channel/scaffolding network, then flash-devitrify 
it into life by pumping energy into the network and dissipating it
more or less uniformly, then retracting/breaking down the
scaffolding. Of course even if we do it very gently, it will give the 
homo novus more than a case of sore throat, but it should be
survivable, especially if we allow for a bit of anaesthesized 
regeneration. See no point in it, though. Bodies are out of fashion.

I'd be curious to hear why the Egyptians "felt" like they were in their
livers.  Was this really true for the average Egyptian?  In certain
relaxation/meditation exercises, one is instructed to relocate one's
consciousness to various parts of the body.  I could never do this, and
became acutely aware that I "felt" like "I" existed right behind my eyeballs
and couldn't really move.  Is that because I've always been taught that's
where my brain is and it is the source of my consciousness?  Or is there
possibly a physiological reason for this phenomenon?

If "increasing your extropy" means the same as Doing the Right Thing(tm),
ok. I just hope we all realize the specialization of human genders
becomes an atavism in a drastically changed environment of
post/trans/whateverhumanity. Even if the things material mutate into
degenerated mindstuff, I hope at least the virtual realm will be
inhabited by many memetically diverse species, radiating from us-founders.

Yup, sorry. My English is notoriously sloppy. On which basis? Just
anecdotal evidence. Of course we could do a poll to put a finger on it.
Of course there is multiple bias of being a bunch of english-speaking

Does saying "IMO" mean you don't think you can articulate *why* one can't
"assign a probability"?  Taken literally, your claim seems clearly false.  
So what exactly do you mean?

All these people who don't think an upload would "be them" unless it

If you are standing in a room looking at an
*exact* duplicate (except for position) of
yourself, do you imagine that you would
be unable to tell which person you were?
Do you believe that you would be able
to experience both sets of senses at the
same time?  If each brain can only sense
experiences from the set of eyes, ears, 
and so on that it is hooked up to, then how
can they be the same person?

Yes, but the same is true of anyone, and that's not
a useful reply. :)

I disagree that it matters what *atoms* are used, 
individually.  It *does*, IMHO, matter what continuity
of experience is possible.

It does nothing of the sort. Both tests depend on you making assumptions 
about the connection between certain sounds I make with my mouth and my 
subjective feelings. The assumption could very well be correct, I have a 
hunch they are,  but you'll never be able to prove it.

Why? Where is the spatial location of green, or fast, or the number eleven? 
Don't these things exist?

That's remembering the past not detecting time, besides a sequence need not

Without senses just how would you detect that I stopped your brain and then  
restarted it?

You seem surprised.  Are you agreeing that consciousness resides in the
brain, or disagreeing.  I think that it is obvious that consciousness
resides in the brain, and that different states of consciousness
correspond with different measurable states of the brain function.  John
seems to think that consciousness resides outside or unconnected to the
body or brain, and has no spatial location.

As for your second question, I'm unsure what you're asking.  All
scientific evidence shows the brain to be responsible for consciousness.
My "feeling" or "sensing" on the matter has little to do with scientific
determination.

>The Egyptians felt their consciousness in their livers, for example.

Funny you should mention this.  The Egyptians and Hebrews believed that
they expresses emotions with their liver, not with their hearts.  Where
the Old Testament characters say that their "heart felt heavy with
sorrow" or their "heart leapt with joy", the original text actually
referred to the liver.

This was one of the first clues I had that the Bible wasn't translated
correctly, and that someone else was trying to decide for me what I
could and could not understand.  I had purchased an interlinear Bible
with the original Hebrew text under the English translation in the Old
Testament passages.  I wanted to translate the scriptures to find out
for myself what they really said.  By chance, the first passage I tried
to translate on my own contained the Hebrew word for liver.  After I
translated it on my own and compared the English text, I found the
English version said "heart".  I double-checked my work, but was certain
that I had made a correct translation.  After some investigation, I
found a passage in the forward that explained this very discrepancy.  It
explained that many Hebrew idioms were unknown to the English reader.
To "facilitate" understanding, the English text may not be a literal
word-per-word translation, but at times may show what the Hebrew really
"means", not what it really says.  This infuriated me, and set me off on
my first big quest to translate and figure out what *really* was going
on.  I didn't like people translating the "truth" for me, because I was
not expected to be able to understand it for myself.

My research into what the Bible really said, lead me to change my
understanding about what the ancient JudeoChristian religion really was
about.  I expanded my research to cover the Apocrypha, the pseud., and
later into medieval grimoires and then through all different religious
texts.  I finally decided that I had to read everybody's claims, but
then had to make up my own mind.

This idea that the Hebrews and Egyptians expressed their emotions with
their liver was one of the confirmations in my early development that
other people would withhold the truth "for my own good", and that I had
to fight for my own understanding, because nobody else cared if I
understood or not.  All they wanted was my agreement with their
conclusions.

Let me pursue my earlier examples, then.  When we last left our discussion,
I had described a set of computer systems.

In one, we had a computer built out of double-thick components.  Each
wire and transistor took up twice the area which would normally be used.
You agreed, after we clarified the example, that cutting the area in half
would not result in anyone's death or the loss of anyone's consciousness.

Now let me re-propose the system above, but with a divider down the middle
of the double-width components, a divider which can be electrically switched
between conducting and insulating states.

When it acts as a conductor, the two sides are electrically connected and
we have effectivelly the double-width circuit example above.  When it acts
as an insulator, the two sides are electrically separated and the system
acts like two circuits.  However, due to the fact that the two halves are
electrically identical, the two circuits stay synchronized at all times as
they operate.

Now, what will you say happens as we switch between the insulating and
conductive states for the divider which runs down the middle of each
circuit?  Would you view this as causing two instances of the computation
to run when it is insulating, while one instance runs when it is conductive?

If the computation is a conscious program (an upload or AI), will this cause
a switch between two individuals and one?

If you think so, suppose you learn more about the circuit and discover that
the electric fields are such that electrons never actually cross the divider
even when it is in the conductive state.  They travel lengthwise down the
wires but there is no electric fields pushing them sidewise, hence they
never need to cross over the divider region.  So actually changing between
insulating and conductive does not change the behavior of any electron in
the system.  Their paths are unchanged.

Would you still think that making the divider insulating causes one
individual to become two?

How about if we can vary the divider's insulation smoothly between full
conductivity and perfect insulation?  Does it make sense to say that it
is possible for one person to _gradually_ become two?

Would these changes actually be perceptable to the person(s) involved?
Would the consciousness feel any different as we switch between the two
cases?

Thanks,

Hal

Let’s define a copy:

- It is an exact replica, atom for atom.
- It shares the same memories and personality.
- It experiences the same sensations.
- It displays the same behaviour.

Is the copy "me"?

Correctly phrased the question should be, "am I
the copy?"  As I've said before, there is no
reason to make the distinction between copy and
original.  It serves absolutely no purpose.

Imagine for a minute sitting in a symmetrical room
looking at your copy from across a symmetrical
table.  You both experience the exactly same
sensations, you both react to them in exactly the
same way, and you both behave in exactly the same
way.  You try to start a conversation, this is no
different from talking to yourself – you know what
you’re going to say, you know the answer, and you
"both" say it at the same time.

- There is no objective difference.
- There is no subjective difference.

This only leaves room for a mystical difference
and a semantic difference.  I believe the problem
is the latter, and that's the reason we should not
make the distinction.

- Would a copy contribute to my own ability?

Having two versions of you that are exactly the
same cannot contribute to your actions (i.e. your
ability or power has not doubled).  The copy will
display the same behaviour, opinions, and
reasoning as you, it will also experience the same
sensations as you.

- When a copy is made, are there two of me?

There is functionally one person.  The senses can
be said to have the same spatial location (because
they recieve the same information) and subjective
experience will be identical.  The number of
processors and the location of those processors
will have no effect on the subjective experience.

- Is killing a copy murder?

Let’s look at the method of replacing each cell,
one by one, with an artificial one.  If, instead
of putting the cells in a pile, we arranged them
to recreate the "original" but leave them
inanimate, have we committed murder?  Likewise, is
creating a copy (refer to the definition given
above) and destroying the original murder?  Since
the copy cannot contribute anything to the
original (and vice versa) they can act as
redundancy, destroying one is not murder.

No, I was just echoing the wording of your question, as is clear from
the material above.  I am happy to say that that body has died, but that
the person is still alive.  Likewise, if I find a severed finger, I will
say that the finger is dead, but that the person it was associated with
may still be alive.  The finger used to be alive, but now it is dead.

I did not engage in any such discussion.

I think you are using the terms "person" and "body" synonymously here.
Once we consider people who have no bodies, this correspondence is no
longer so clear.

You might also consider what would happen if you do an autopsy and when
you open the skull you find only a radio transceiver, with transducers
interfacing to all the nerves which come into the brain.  The body was
being tele-operated by a brain (or computer?) elsewhere.  There is an
amusing story based on this concept in the Hofstadter/Dennett collection
"The Mind's I", an excellent book for those interested in these kinds of
issues.

Let me add one other point.  In my opinion, the "alive vs dead" distinction
is not the central point.  The central issue is consciousness, whether it
is terminated or (potentially) continues.

Being "alive" generally applies to biological systems with various
properties of reproduction, maintainance of structure, etc.  There are
many living systems which appear to have no consciousness, such as
bacteria.

It should also become possible to create conscious systems which are not
"alive" by most definitions.  If I load an AI program into my computer so
that it can think, reason, feel, etc., it still would not have most of the
properties generally associated with life.  It would be conscious but not
"alive".

This distinction is seen in the fields of Artificial Intelligence
versus Artificial Life.  The latter studies simulated organisms which
can reproduce and grow in various ways, but which are not necessarily
intelligent or conscious at all.  AI on the other hand cares very little
for the attributes studied by ALife researchers.

Now, you might choose to arbitrarily say that an AI system is "alive", even
though it does not fall into the normal definitions.  I prefer to say that
just as we can have living systems which are not conscious, we could have
conscious systems which are not living.  There is no inherent association
between the two concepts.

Given this perspective, we should recognize that the important factor with
regard to a person is whether his consciousness is not destroyed, not
whether he is biologically dead.  Someone may be dead, but as long as there
is the possibility or actuality that his consciousness goes on, he should
not fear death.

Consciousness, in my view, is an information-processing activity.  A given
instance of consciousness is defined by its state and its transitions as
it processes information.  As long as this information which defines the
consciousness is preserved, it has the potential of continuing.  Rather
than trying to stay alive, we should try to preserve our consciousness,
in this sense.

So seeing a dead body does not by itself give you enough information
to judge whether the information which defines the consciousness, the
"person", it embodied, has been lost.  Rather than focusing on death vs
life, the issue is better dealt with in informational terms, in my
opinion.

Please reference any post where someone claims either of these two
points.  I think you are misreading the positions of those who disagree
with you.  This is why your responses seem to be non sequiturs.

Robin, I'm not sure I get your meaning, but I certainly agree with
Dan's position. I'm not even sure Darwin still holds in the SI domain, 
I'm not certain of anything. I do not see how anyone who goes on two
legs can sensibly speculate about that _hypothetic_ future entity/state
labelled 'SI'. If in the retrospective (if we survive the Grand 
Transition) someone's visions turn out to be right in the outline, the 
more power to you++. It is certainly mentally stimulating speculating
about autoreplicator colonization fronts, GUT devices, quantum and 
recursive basement universe computing, etc., but just now this is
entertainment.  We need the pre-SI models to dynamically adjust our 
trajectories as we fall into the Singularity, and there will be
probably no discontinuity involved as the observer traverses the
prediction analogon of the Schwarzschild radius, but we should not try 
to forecast too far too soon.

>From SCIENCE-WEEK July 17, 1998:

2. COSMOLOGY: THE END OF THE OLD MODEL UNIVERSE
Cosmologists are apparently expecting the near-future necessity
for profound conceptual alterations in their field. Peter Coles
(University of London, UK) presents a short review of the current
situation and makes the following points: 1) Observations only
recently made possible by improvements in astronomical
instrumentation have put theoretical models of the Universe under
intense pressure. The standard ideas of the 1980s about the shape
and history of the Universe have now been abandoned -- and
cosmologists are now taking seriously the possibility that the
Universe is pervaded by some sort of "vacuum energy" whose origin
is not at all understood. 2) The weakness of the Big Bang model
is that the numerical values of certain essential parameters in
the model (the Hubble constant, the density parameter, and, in
some versions, the cosmological constant) are not predicted by
theory, and thus the parameters must be inferred from
observations. 3) The Big Bang model does not deserve to be called
a "theory" unless and until it can explain how nonuniformities of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies came into being and evolved. 4)
The Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation, first proposed
in the 1980s, is in serious difficulty because the consequent
significant gravitational break on expansion is not evident, and
in fact expansion may be accelerating. Current observations
coupled with current dynamical arguments all suggest a global
density of matter in the Universe less than the value required to
make the Universe recollapse. 5) The existence of a cosmological
constant (or vacuum energy) of the required size necessary to
make the basic cosmological models work is not at all explained
by current theories of the fundamental interactions of matter. 6)
There is every reason to be confident that the important issues
will soon be resolved, because a data explosion is about to
engulf cosmology, a new generation of galaxy surveys. The Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, for example, will encompass more than a
million galaxies. The cosmological community is bracing itself
for the arrival of these enormous new data sets and the new
insights they will surely bring. 7) It is possible that none of
the available models will fit all the new data. Coles concludes:
"For many of us, that is the most exciting possibility of all, as
we would have to move to stranger theories, perhaps not even
based on General Relativity."

Very well, but I very much doubt there will be a choice even on the
short run. If Darwin still holds, the fitter newcomers sooner or later 
will come to compete for the resources. From the point of view of
these new fast, sleek beasts on the block, these atoms wasted on the 
planetary core for 1 g habitat, the ecosystem to maintain you, and 
even the utilization efficiency on the atoms in your body must seem
quite a waste.

No, that's not what I'm talking about, although that's also, by 
definition, a Good Thing (tm :-).

Which is the higher extropy state?  A woman virtually enslaved to her 
husband as a drudge in, say, Iran, or an author writing popular 
non-fiction in New Zealand?

Ability-wise, those two people may be very similar.  However, due to a few 
cultural differences -- differences that have only recently come into 
being, and are still rather tenuous -- their personal extropy may be
considerably different.

For that reason, I'm not at all averse to people discussing these issues 
on this list.  In the here and now, removing unfair discrimination is one 
way of increasing the world's collective extropy.

I would add one more data point to "we're in for a cosmological
revolution": the existence of life.

The most plausible model for the origin of life is that it requires
10^100+ chemical trials for the right combination of circumstances
to occur.

If the universe is a mere 20GY old, that isn't enough time.

Life -> a much older (or much larger) universe.

There's an interesting historical precedent:
In the late 1800's, physicists calculated how long the sun would last,
assuming a coal-burning source of energy.  The answers were Usherish,
less than 100KY.  The geologists insisted from rock&sediment evidence
that the minimum age for the earth was more like 100MY.  This anomaly
could have been read as "the sun must run on a more powerful energy
source than coal, or must be renewed somehow".  Eventually, fusion
was discovered, resolving the problem.

My instant critical thinking response to this is: 
Who was it that started this thread about gender? As far as I can tell, it
was males.

My instant social psychologist's response is:
If you think gender is a non-issue for those who wish to transform their
lives in an extropian direction, then you need to get away from your
computer, come out of your darkened room and look at the real world around
you. Gender stereotypes (often aided and abetted by  alleged scientific
evidence) have stifled the lives and personalities of both males and
females for centuries and ARE STILL DOING SO. Some extropians have made
much progress in breaking free of these chains but if you think no
extropian has such chains, you are very naive indeed. The question of how
much is genetic and how flexible gender roles are is important needed
information in understanding how transformations to more balanced, rational
and creative lives can be facilitated.

I don't know if I agree with Dan or you until I know what you mean.
What is a "sensible" speculation?  

Are you saying, for example, that on average the forecasts I might make 
today about 2098 are no more accurate than the forecast an ancestor of 
mine might have made in 1898 about 2098?

A fair criticism, perhaps, but I still think the naive arguments
against egoism aren't thinking hard enough or long-term enough
in many cases: most of the arguments just blindly assume that
if one commits a crime and is not caught, then there are no
negative consequences to that act.  That's just not true.  There
are consequences to living your life with a set of principles,
and consequences to violating those principles, and not just to
one's self-esteem or confidence in those principles, but in the
real world.

Theft, for example, _always_ has the long-term consequence of
allocating the resources of society inefficiently in the long
run, which eventually impacts my potential for wealth.  Even if
I silently embezzled a few dollars from some billion-dollar
corporation who never notices, that's a few dollars that they
did not use their proven acumen to invest; perhaps a small
project that didn't get funded that may have created a small
product that I might have used to gain more wealth than the
dollars I stole.

Any physical act of force is the same: even if I am never
punished for the act, I have prevented someone from using the
full potential of their will to do things that may benefit me
in the long run.  Every human being is a potential trader, and
_any_ act I do to any human being affects their potential for
future trade with me, so I have still never found any example
of a crime without consequences.  The arguments so far shown
against egoism simply assume the existence of such a crime
without proof.

It could simply be that 'the most plausible' model isn't quite so.

Yes. You are still duplicating every circuit in half regardless of the
method used.  Remember that you have two CPUs.  At first they are
connected in a single-redundant machine seeing the same datastreams.
After the division, they are separated and can only see their own
datastream.  The fact that the datastreams are identical should not
confuse us into thinking that they are both seeing the same datastream.

> If the computation is a conscious program (an upload or AI), will this cause
> a switch between two individuals and one?

Yes.

When you turn the dividers on, you will have split the individual down
the middle and ended up with two copies.  You could then carefully
separate the two sets of hardware and have the two copies go off their
seabird ways.  If they separate and explore the universe, they will
experience and grow differently and evolve into very different entities.
The one entity clearly becomes two when divided in half.  This is just
like cellular division where a single cell divides into two identical
cells by duplicating all its internal parts and separating into two
seabird pieces.

If you put these two individuals back together, and turn off the
divider, only one entity will survive.  It is not clear if it will be
the same as one or the other, or more probably a synthesis of the two.

I do not think that you can assume that the identical entities will not
grow divergent once the divider is turned on.  If they have sensory
input, they will differ by location and possibly by outside input.  If
they share disks, they must take turns accessing the disk or lose the
functionality as they jam each other by accessing at the exact same
time.  If they share a network, they must negotiate unique network
numbers for each of them, like all network devices.  They will either
self-assign different network ID's or will lose the network
functionality that it had before the split.  If they do not share
peripherals, the peripherals must be divided between them, in which case
they lose half of their I/O after the split.  If they do share
peripherals, they must not take turns using them and one of them must go
first and the other second.  Their logs will show radically different
activities at different times.  With printers, for example, they either
lose printer functionality or they share the printer in which case only
one of them will print each numbered page, and only one of them will get
each printer-fault message.  The two individual processes will either
adapt and become divergent, or they will be unable to adapt and will
lose most of their functionality and peripherals.  Either way, the
process of splitting the two radically changes their outlook on the
world, even if only by having to handle each other's existence and
sharing of resources.

Then I would say that someone or something has already divided the
circuits in half before you got to them.  If they were always like this,
then you must have loaded the software *twice*, one for each side.  If
you loaded the software *once*, then only one side has software, and the
other is waiting for installation.  If you loaded software randomly into
different sides of the wire, you have two unrelated computers with no
software being similar on either of them.

> Would you still think that making the divider insulating causes one
> individual to become two?

There is either one circuit representing one bit, or there are two
circuits representing two bits.  It doesn't matter who divided the
circuit or how it was done.  The results of this description of the
division are the same as the results of your previous description of the
division.  I don't see why they would be any different.  In the first
example you say you divided it.  In the second example you say you found
them already divided.  There is the same functional division either way.

> Would these changes actually be perceptible to the person(s) involved?

Yes.  If each processor on each side could only see its own side and did
not know about the other side, it would not perceive a difference
because you are limiting its perception of the universe to perceive only
what you wanted it to perceive.  If both CPUs had unlimited sensory
capability, they would see half of the internal memory chips, circuits
and data being cut off from it's access as the division is slowly made.
You must control the perception of the devices to make them perceive
things the way you describe.  If you give them universal perception,
they will see the whole picture and correctly perceive what you are
doing.  Limiting the CPUs' perception, and then arguing that they can't
perceive a difference seems circular to me.  You are artificially making
the scenario turn out the way you want it to, and then making a
conclusion based on the outcome.  This is known as a "self-fulfilling
prophecy."
 
> Would the consciousness feel any different as we switch between the two
> cases?

Most definitely.  To continue functioning with peripherals, they must
adapt to use cooperation between the two sides.  If they do not
instantly adapt, then they lose their former functionality because of
the change.  There is no way for this change to occur without the two
CPU's detecting it and adapting to it.  A third case would be if they
both instantly hang and both sides cease to function.

Wrong.  Suppose my copy and I want to move the table to one side.  If we
both point to the same wall, one would be pointing left while one would
be pointing right.  Obviously we are not acting the same.  If we both
point right or we both point left, we will be pointing at different
walls. Obviously we cannot agree on which wall to point towards.  Since
we are different people in different locations, it is impossible for us
to both act and react identically.  As in this situation, we must
diverge.

You feel your mind is behind your eyeballs because the middle of your skill is
not only the  visual stereoscopic center of perception, but aural as well. Note,
if you ask a blind and deaf person where they feel their mind is, they will
reply: "In my fingertips".....

Then I would think that the consciousness was wherever the brain was.
If the brain was transplanted out of the original body into a new body,
it is clear to me that the consciousness followed.  If the brain remains
in the original body unchanged by the procedure, it is not clear to me
if the consciousness is elsewhere.

Agreed.  I think many people are confusing the questions here.  The
question "is the copy me?" is a totally different question from "is the
original me?".  The goal of preserving our current original
consciousness must choose to save the original, the copy, both, neither,
or either.  Many different scenarios are all being lumped together and
confused in these conversations.

Yes, I agree with this.  Your point is well taken that the whole concept
of "alive" or "dead" is not really central to the question of continuing
consciousness.  It now appears that my original question using the word
"alive" was vague and ill-conceived.  It may not express my true
concerns or question very well at all.

This implies that you think all identical model Pentium II's running
identical copies of Windows 98 are all the same PC.  The PC's are all
the identical body.  The software is all the same program.  The
documents on the disk are all the same information.  Are these all the
same PC?  Would you count PC's sold by gateway based on what was loaded
in their memory or harddrives rather than counting boxes, locations, or
distinct physical entities?

This implies that I shouldn't worry if my PC crashes, as long as an
identical PC somewhere with the same program continues on.

Agreed.  Seeing the original body tells me that the original program is
no longer functional or experiencing, but gives me no information about
any possible copies.  Seeing a copy tells me that the copy program is
still functional and experiencing, but gives me no information about the
possible states of the original.  You cannot judge the copy's state by
looking at the original, or the original's state by looking at the copy.
This latter judgement seems to be the one that copy-and-kill advocates
seem to be making.

I think we must somehow follow the original consciousness to see where
it ends up.  If we follow it to the new body, that would be success.  If
we follow it to the dead body, then that would be failure.

I'm too tired right now to come up with any proposals for how to 
answer the following  questions. Anybody got any rethorical ideas?

TRANSHUMANISM AND NATURE

Why do transhumanists want to live longer?

(Henri Kluytmans:)
-Because I like living.
-Because I want to do, experience, learn enormously more than I can do
in a natural lifespan.

Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

(HK:)
-Yes, but don't we humans do that all the time.
-Yes, but isn't that just what distinguishes us from animals.

Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

(HK:)
-They will probably evolve us into not-humans (i.e. post-humans).

Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?

Might transhuman technologies be dangerous?

Obviously you will experience SOME negative consequences, but egoism (like
all other utility-oriented consequentialist ethical systems) states that
negative consequences are OK, so long as they are outweighed by positive
consequences.  The choice which results in the greatest net gain for you
(no matter how much you lose and later recover) is the best, according to
egoism.

In this example, though that money isn't going to filter back into the
economy like it would have otherwise, you have to weigh that against the
utility you would get from having a billion dollars all to yourself.  Your
argument only works if you would make more than a billion dollars worth in
utility by not stealing the billion; I strongly doubt that this is true.
When someone else invests money wisely, you only make back a fraction of
what they invested and reaped; had you taken the money for yourself, you
would still have made a profit, despite the fact that some fraction of it
will no longer be able to filter its way into your pocket through
legitimate means.

Stealing is definitely profitable, and to the extent that it is (and no
further) egoism demands that we steal.

Again, I don't need a crime WITHOUT consequences, just a crime that has
more and better positive consequences than negative.

In this example, suppose that you were enslaving your victim.  Sure,
you'll never have the opportunity to trade freely with your victim again,
but if you're doing it right, you're making much more off of this person
by enslaving them than you ever could have by trading freely.  The pie
which you both would have shared has decreased in size thanks to your
coercion, but you have gained more pie than you have lost; and that, for
egoism, makes all the difference.

Because after you choose to die, you can't change your mind; inversely, a
choice to live is always reversible.  Why limit your options?

No, it is entirely natural for Homo sapiens to use tools to maximize their 
lifespans.  The first example would probably be the spear.  We are not
alone: chimpanzees use long twigs to fish termites out of their nests,
surely this extends their lifespan.(other examples...?)

Maybe, but only in the same sense as when an ape picked up a tool and he
was no longer a lower primate.  The ape practiced auto-evolution, why
can't we?

Maybe this ape was truly the first cyborg? (pardon my
definition-stretching...)

Animals use tools to help them live longer.  Beaver dams leap to mind.

PLEASE don't answer this question this way.  It sounds like you're saying
"Yes, it will make us less compassionate; in fact, none of us are very in
touch with regular old human compassion to begin with."  Remember, that's
what the word inhuman MEANS: lacking in compassion.  Look it up.

The correct answer, I think:

No one is really certain what we'll be like when we become posthuman; 
while some have speculated, there is no obvious evidence to
suggest that posthumans would be any less compassionate than we humans are
today.  While some have argued that posthumans would be as indifferent
toward humans as humans are toward other primates, there are also other
considerations which are harder to take into account.

For example, right now we tend to overlook the desires and needs of other
animals; perhaps because they do not have the language to demand their
rights or the intellectual capacity to make use of them.  However, all
this would probably change if animals acquired these skills, or if we had
the power to teach them.  It would be much more difficult to perform
painful and/or deadly experiments on laboratory rats if they could provide
a cogent argument in their own defense. 

Similarly, since posthumans would probably have originally been humans at
one time, or could see a way by which other humans might become
posthumans, posthumans might treat humans differently from other animals,
perhaps even offering humans the opportunity to augment themselves into
posthumanity. 

As for how posthumans might treat other posthumans, it seems impossible to
speculate.  Would a posthuman, particularly one with better control over
its own mind, have needs of any kind?  Desires?  If so, it's hard to
imagine what precisely they might be; and without some kind of
super-intelligence of our own we probably cannot even begin to fathom how
posthumans might go about fulfilling themselves or how they might react to
the goals of other posthumans.

> Are transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?

-Long lived persons have much more to gain from long term investment;
unlike short-lived people, posthumans will live to feel the long term
effects of today's actions, and will be equipped with a superior
intelligence and technology with which they can predict the outcome of
their choices, prepare for the future, and solve difficult problems before
and/or after they have an effect.

You are correct that my statement is clearly false. I can assign any probability
I choose in the range 0 to 1 inclusive. What I meant was that I can think of
no reasonable way to defend any particular choice. Hmm, where did I put
my articulator? I know it's around here somewhere .... Ahh, yes. Ahem:

Since the SI will be vastly more intelligent than humans, IMO we may not
be able to comprehend its motivations, much less predict them. The SI will
be so smart that its actions are constrained only by the laws of physics,
and it will choose a course of action based on its motivations.

Can we examine a set of feasible scenarios? (i.e. scenarios not prohibited
by the laws of physics?) Of course. But we can't enumerate them all, and
we can't IMO even rationally select a methodology with which to weigh them
against each other.

Let's look at a range of possible motivations and actions:
M=motivation, A-action.

M: SI wants to maximize its intelligence quickly
A: SI restructures the mass of the solar system into a computer

M: SI wants to maximize intellectual diversity
A: SI force-uploads everybody and starts GP on copies.

M: SI wants to maximize its power long-term
A: SI sends replicator probes to in all directions.

M: SI wants to die.
A: SI terminates itself.

M: SI decides SIs are a BAD THING.
A: SI terminates self and humanity.

M: SI wants to see the end of the universe ASAP(having read both
   Douglas Adams and Tipler).
A: SI accelerates self (self equals all mass in solar system?)
   at high continuous accel to enhance time dilation.

M: SI decides humanity is wonderful as it is.
A: SI goes covert, suppresses all other SIs and research leading to them.

OK, how do I assign probabilities to the motivations, and how do I
assign probabilities that a listed action follows from the motivation?

Meta-problem (extra credit): Are the human concepts of motivations, actions
and the relationships between them applicable to an SI?

Sorry that this is a bit off topic (It *does* have the word DNA in it, plus
it's really libertarian in nature of which I know there are many on this
list)

A major national current affairs program run on our government owned
national broadcaster (ABC), The 7:30 Report (16 July 98) tonight contained
the most alarming news I've heard in a long time.

You know those blood test things they do with the baby's feet at birth here
in Australia ?  (and probably everywhere else in the Western world)

We've just found out that the government have kept them all.
They now have 5 million.  (We have a population of only 18 - 20 million)

- They are providing them to law enforcement officials on request. (That
didn't take long !)

- At the time they did the test on my kids, I asked if they were kept and
told NO. There isn't a hope in hell I'd agree otherwise, and it looked so
suspicious at the time that I asked on at least two occasions about this.

- They are being used in genetic experimentation, testing and for detailed
genetic analysis. These are NOT anonymous samples. They contain our kids
identity information. I think the audience on the extropian list would
realise
the implications of someone somewhere having a database record containing
information about your genome attached to your name. Insurance companies
would love this information - they'd know how to set your premium,
especially if the analysis had already been done for them and was included
in the file.

- Seen/read Gattica, 1984, Brave New World etc ? If you're
wondering what sort of infrastructure is required before that future can
arrive, I'll let you know the very first one - genetic imprints of all
citizens at birth.

I've started a mailing list that I'll use to promote awareness about this.
Send an email to genethics-request@list.to with the word SUBSCRIBE in the
message body.  This internet discussion group will aim to provide a forum
where concerned parents can work towards getting our kids DNA back.

This message is being circulated widely on the internet.  There is going to
be some real people power on a genetic issue for the first time in
Australian politics.

You probably can't think of a reasonable way to calculate the temperature
of a black hole either, but that doesn't mean other people can't do it.
Do you mean to claim more than that *you* *now* haven't thought of

Why do you assume such a strong association between intelligence and
motivations?  It seems to me that intelligence doesn't change one's
primary purposes much at all, though it may change one's tactics as one
better learns the connection between actions and consequences.

Certainly I'd know which person I was, I'd be the one who was staring at

cylindrical symmetry and both bodies were standing an equal distance from the 
center then there would only be one conscious being in the room. If I  wanted

nerve, perhaps by some radio link, so that the image that the eyes one body

nothing would change because the signals were identical.

If the room did not have cylindrical symmetry then the information they

would be two conscious being in the room. Both would think they were

"In Vitro and In Vivo Antineoplastic Effects of Orthovanadate"
Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry 153: 161-166 1995

Abstract:

  In the present study we have demonstrated that orthovanadate at
concentrations of 0.005-0.01 mM is cytotoxic to proliferating cells
including primary cultures and tumour cell lines. However, concentrations
of up to 0.05 mM did not affect the viability of non-proliferating cells.
The cytotoxicity appears to be dependent on the vanadium concentration
rather than on the oxidation state of vanadium or the vanadium compound.
Furthermore, tumour cell lines with different proliferative rates were
equally sensitive to orthovanadate cytotoxicity. Although the mechanism
responsible for the cytotoxicity are not known, addition of H2O2
potentiated orthovanadate cytotoxicity suggesting that hydroxyl or
vanadium radicals may be involved. In vivo subcutaneous injections of
orthovanadate into mice containing MDAY-D2 tumours resulted in the
inhibition of tumour growth by 85-100%. These data indicated that
orthovanadate at concentrations greater than 0.005 mM has antineoplastic
properties and may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent.

Further quotes from text:

"Orthovanadate cytotoxicity on tumour cell lines and drug resistant cell
lines:

  Since orthovanadate appeared to be selectively cytotoxic to proliferating
cells, we investigated the effect of orthovanadate on several tumour cell
lines. The cytotoxic effects of orthovanadate on an adherent human
astrocytoma cell line (HTB14), a mouse haematopoietic cell line (MDAY-D2)
grown in suspension and an adherent mouse endothelial cell line (EOMA) are
demonstrated in Fig. 2. Orthovanadate was cytotoxic to all of the cell
lines examined. Between 0.005-0.01 mM of orthovanadate was required for
cell toxicity, and concentrations of 0.025 mM or greater reduced cell
density by over 98% in 48 h.
  To determine whether orthovanadate is toxic to drug resistant cell lines,
we compared the effect of orthovanadate on three cell lines, KB8, KB8-5,
and KB85-11, which have increasing drug resistance respectively, relative
to the parent cell line, KB3-1. These drug resistant cell lines are not
killed by several classes of chemotherapeutic agents such as colchicine,
vinblastine and doxorubicin. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, orthovanadate was
equally cytotoxic to all of the drug resistant cell lines.

Efficacy of different forms of vanadium

  Figuare 3 compares the cytotoxic effect of orthovanadate, vanadyl sulfate
and peroxovanadate on MDAY D2 cell sultures. The cytotoxic effects of all
three vanadium compounds showed a similar concentration
dependance................

Orthovanadate inhibition of tumour growth in vivo

  To determine whether orthovanadate may be useful as an antineoplastic
agent, the effect of orthovanadate treatment on a subcutaneous MDAY-D2
tumour mouse model was examined. The weight of tumours from individual mice
is demostrated in Fig. 6. Mice with small tumours (Day 5) treated daily
with 0.5 mg of orthovanadate on the opposite tumour-free posterior side for
9 days showed a significant decrease in tumour growth compared to mice
treated with vehicle alone. In control animals, the tumour weights varied
from 0.86-1.74 g, whereas in orthovanadate treated mice, four mice did not
have detectible tumours and 11 mice had tumours varying from 0.08-0.47 g.
Orthovanadate treatment either completely inhibited tumour formation or
reduced tumour growth by over 85% when compared to controls. In comparison,
the average body weight of the control group was 22.5 +- 1.7 g and the
orthovanadate treated group was 19.4 +- 2.1 g.

  ..............Thus, the higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen
species in proliferating tumour cells may provide a mechanism to explain
the increased sensitivity of tumour cells to orthovanadate cytotoxicity.
  The present study demonstrates that orthovanadate reduced tumour growth
in mice. Subcutaneous injections of orthovanadate daily for nine days
reduced MDAY-D2 tumour growth in mice by 85-100%. Although the animals
showed some stress immediately following each injection, their body weight
over the treatment period was approximately 85-90% that of the untreated
animals. These data indicate that orthovanadate may be a useful
antineoplastic agent for the treatment of tumours, particularly drug
resistant tumours. In addition, the gastritis induced by oral
administration of orthovanadate or vanadyl sulphate may be explained by the
cytotoxic effects of these vanadium compounds on the rapidly proliferating
surface epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Whether these
general toxic effects can be abolished by conjugating vanadium with organic
molecules or by supplementing its administration with antioxidents remains
to be determined."

Addition note by poster:

  I am so impressed by vanadium's potential in chemotherapy, that until
angiostatin/endostatin therapy becomes commercially available, I believe
injections of vanadium compounds should be the last line of defence
against drug resistant tumours. I'd suggest it as a first line of defence
as well, but commercial interests being what they are, unfortunately only
patented drugs come under active consideration by doctors.

I'll give you the same answer I gave Bryan Moss:

Wrong.  Suppose my copy and I want to move the table to one side.  If we
both point to the same wall, one would be pointing left while one would
be pointing right.  Obviously we are not acting the same.  If we both
point right or we both point left, we will be pointing at different
walls. Obviously we cannot agree on which wall to point towards.  Since
we are different people in different locations, it is impossible for us
to both act and react identically.  As in this situation, we must
diverge.

Has anyone seen the animated short that deals with the problem of
teleportation?  It was produced with the assistance of the Canadian NFB. I
wish I could remember what it was called.  It covers the same philosophical
problem as with uploading (in the short, the teleporter works by producing
an identical copy and destroying the original).  Brilliant, funny, and
philosophically dead-on.

Oh, they don't have to.  I just don't think that copies
are as good as transfers, for uploads.  I don't have
any problem with copies, or even with generating
them myself, but I don't think it does *me* any good
if I have copies that will survive indefinitely.  For my

No, closer to say that the "Randall Test" *includes*
the Turing Test, as it now stands.  A better understanding
of consciousness might help us avoid even that.

Let me put this another way.  We know that people
make similar sounds on occasion.  We also know
that people have similar brains, and that therefore
the sounds must be produced by similar processes
in those brains.  The fact that a tape recorder can make
those sounds, however, does not mean that the same
processes are going on in the tape recorder, since
it is a different sort of machine.  Since we know, from
personal experience, that human brains *can* be 
conscious, and we know that other human brains do
cause similar sounds to ours, we can assume that
they are conscious, and begin our study of consciousness
with that.

So which is this model? Your claim seems not to fit in well with the
current thinking about autocatalytic networks of RNA-like molecules,
which would have a much faster evolution. In fact, it sounds like a
common creationist claim, based on the idea that the molecules must
randomly bump into each other to form a cell or something similar,
instead of the bootstrapping process of increasing complexity most
paleobiologists subscribe to.

Exactly. Give me a situation where steeling is profitable, I would steal sooner
than later (of course without hurting anyone) . And if I wouldn't, someone
else would. The opportunity to steel only points to a bug in the security
system, that needs to be fixed. So egoism is really the driving force
behind improvements of the legal and economical systems. In fact,
they probably wouldn't exist without egoism.

Essentially, yes. Assuming, 2098 is PostSingularity you can only safely 
exclude anything not in accordance with physical laws, but given what 
little we know this set of constraints is not very stringent. Of
course if we run into saturation it might turn out your predictions

No, I'm ascribing 10^100 to the RNA autocatalysis scenarios.
I find the RNA scheme unconvincing:  There are too many "could-haves"
and "maybes" and not enough experimental support.  Dyson raises the
objection (to an RNA-first world) that the pieces of the monomers
(sugar + amino acid) are not both stable in the same chemical
environment, so it's unlikely that they both accumulated enough to
react significantly.

Replication is supposed to happen without the help of enzymes.
The schemes have no place for metabolism or partition into cells.
Protein translation is relegated to later evolution.

I'd have to reconsider my opinion if someone actually came up
with test-tube examples of autocatalytic "life".  Obviously it
doesn't have to be RNA, or protein, or polysaccharide, or even clay:
if we had any example of an evolving replicator, it's much more
plausible that it evolved to new technology.

Dyson argues that 7 or 8 ingredients in the cycle should be enough,
but I don't know of anyone attempting to put some chemical flesh on
the bones of his theory.

The idea of a whole cell coming together at random isn't just 10^100
improbable; that's in the 10^10^10 range of unlikelihood.  It's more
likely that a Conway Life replicator would arise in random soup, a
mere 2^10^6 unlikely.

We do have excellent evidence of the adaptability of life to extreme
environments, and some earth microbes have undoubtedly been boosted
into escaping the solar system.  We shouldn't be too shocked if we find
Mars or Ganymede has organisms sharing DNA sequences with E. Coli.

The creationists have a few good points, just as the opponents of
infinitesimals forced more rigor on calculus.

It seems to me that the unresolved issue concerning
this question is whether or not there is some aspect
of a living organism that could not be "captured" by
the uploading process, i.e., the representative copy
of an organism's brain that is uploaded to another
substrate. I must confess I feel anxiety when thinking
about uploading. I constructed a scenario own views on
the issue outlined above.

What would you do if faced with the following situation:

You are approached by an individual who offers you
$100 million (if money does not suit you then insert
any other item that you would assign a very high value).
The catch is that you must agree to have your brain
scanned using the latest in pre-upload scan technology.
The scan will be stored dormant in a memory block. You
will then be killed. Twenty-four hours later the dormant
scan of your brain will be downloaded into your repaired
body. Any damage to your brain, body, etc. would be
completely repaired. You would be "jump-started" and then
handed whatever was promised to you.

Would take this person up on this offer? 

I found myself uncertain and a bit anxious. Why? I could
not really articulate why I was anxious. I feared that the
person that received the prize (and who was alive) would
not be me, even though by every scientific measure it
would be me.

Whether you do or don't accept the offer is based on your
view of the issue I described above. If you think scans
capture everything then you would risk nothing in return
for something of great value. On the other hand, if you
have doubts about the ability of scanning then you would
be apprehensive. I confess I am apprehensive.

Despite my ideas about the possibility of uploading and 
my lack of belief in a "soul", I still could not help but
fear that some aspect of me would not be captured. 
Would the memories the revived "me" had be genuine? 
Would they be the memories it (i.e., me) actually 
experienced or would they be downloaded records?
For that matter, what's the different between the two if
the downloaded record has all the information I remember from
the experience.

To all the neuro-cogniscenti out there, is there any
substantiation to my apprehension? Is there any evidence that
uploading might not capture all the aspects of the human mind?

Wanting to live forever is an axiom of my current private

Good point, but afaik there is no consistent theory of human actions,
either, and we're a good deal more predictable than an SI. Ergodic
systems are intrinsically unpredictable, and you can't prove the SI is 
not occasionally ergodic.

I could reason evolutionary, but I have no idea whether this still applies
to the SI. Areas of human enterprise is certainly unapplicable.

You sound very sure of yourself.

Both of you point to your left and see the other
pointing to your right – no divergence.

So you decide the walls are different and to check
you write your name on the left-hand wall. Now
both walls have your name on them and both
instances of you are seeing the exact same thing –
no divergence.

You cannot mark the walls, you cannot distinguish
between them. You cannot even distinguish between
yourself, you're seeing the same thing, doing the
same thing. There are no differences.

Agree? You can't even strike up a conversation –
you’re talking to yourself.

Your problem with this scenario is not copying,
uploading, or consciousness, but location. What is
location? The wall in my example is in the same
location, prove me wrong.

>From http://www.pcfix2000.com/

PCFIX2000 is the result of over 4 years of research. We've worked with
hundreds upon hundreds of PCs and have discovered all manner of problems
that can come from the BIOS Software or the CMOS Clock. We built a
matrix of BIOS Software and Clock chip faults, resolved the required
'fix' for each fault, and finally coded it into a 
utility program that executes whenever your system is powered up or
reset! 

PCFIX2000 tests and corrects the date according to our selective
algorithm whenever it is required, then it goes away. PCFIX2000 passes a
valid date to the Operating System and CMOS Clock. 

Unlike most other utilities, PCFIX2000 provides automatic adjustment to
both the operating system and hardware clock and flawlessly handles Year
2000 transition and date adjustments; even AFTER 1-01-2000! 

PCFIX2000 also handles ALL LEAP YEAR Clock adjustments including
automatic date recovery for MISSING LEAP DAYS. There are no critical
BIOS dates or CMOS Clock limitations with PCFIX2000 because it adjusts
for every BIOS and Clock from every properly functioning IBM compatible
PC. 

PCFIX2000 Installation is a snap because the installation program is
very user-friendly. No complicated instructions, no configuration
hassles and no headaches. PCFIX2000 truely is the UNIVERSAL PC YEAR 2000
HARDWARE FIX! Nothing else even comes close. 

PCFIX2000 will enable all properly functioning IBM PC compatable systems
to pass all date/time tests for 2000 compliance. 

We are so convinced about the universal capability of PCFIX2000 we
guarantee that once installed on a non-compliant PC, it will remain
hardware 2000 compliant for the life of your PC or we will give a full
refund.

Only if there was a mark on the wall of some sort, we'd need to distinguish 
one particular part of the wall from other parts to know where to point. 
If it did have such a mark then the room would no longer have cylindrical 
symmetry so the two would receive different information from their eyes and 
they would indeed diverge into two conscious beings just as I originally said.

Who among us wants life to end?  Perhaps the suicidal because they suffer
from acute depression, and perhaps the elderly or diseased because their
bodies have become overly burdensome, and perhaps those who die attempting
to save the lives of others.  But what if you didn't grow old, and what if
depression was easily treatable?  As long as life continued to give you
pleasure, what reason could you ever give for choosing to end it?  Our most
intense emotions are associated with our fear of death and our grief over
the deaths of others.  The most natural and powerful of all motivations is
the motivation to live.

Consider also that by the time you get really good at your chosen
profession, learn how to love and to be loved, and develop wisdom, patience,
and tolerance, you've got maybe twenty years to take advantage of it before
you become too old and have to retire.  Meanwhile, you've passed on only a
small fraction of the information you spent a lifetime accruing to the next
generation who must retrace your steps all over again.  This is a terribly
inefficient and tragically wasteful system.

> Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?

We have done very well for ourselves tampering with nature so far (e.g.
medicine, heating & air-conditioning, books).


> Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?


The extropian ideal is to become more than human, to enhance those qualities
than make us human.  Becoming inhuman is just the opposite, becoming less
than human.

I don't know what you mean by "saturation." 

You don't need to "safely exclude anything" to be able to make more 
accurate forecasts.   You just have to assign a higher probability to 
what turns out to be the right answer.  Consider the probability 
distributions my 1898 ancestor would have assigned to these:
1) Number of his/her human decendants in 2098
2) Median physical mass of each descendant in 2098
3) Median age till death of each descendant in 2098
4) Median number of immediate descendants of each descendant
5) Median distance each descendant lives from where he lives
6) Modal religious affiliation of descendants

*Any* difference in his/her vs. my distributions assigned should mean
I will make better forecasts (assuming I'm rational).  Even if the 
distribution I would assign is broader than the distribution
he/she would have assigned, reflecting the realization of a wider range
of possibilities, that still means I am more likely to assign a 
higher probability to the right answer.

Of course there are consistent theories of human actions.  Consistency is 
a pretty easy constraint to meet.  And of course ergodic systems can be
predicted; they just can't be predicted perfectly accurately.  Take just 
about any theory and add in a noise component, and that theory is 
consistent with most any set of observations.  It just may not assign 
as high a likelihood to those observations than a better theory.

What areas of human enterprise can't evolutionary concepts apply to?
And even if *you* have no idea whether they apply, how do you know others
of us don't have a better idea?

I just picked up Allen Steele's 1996 novel _A King of Infinite Space_, in
which extropians are the major characters. They start off looking like the
bad guys, then turn out to be the good guys after all...   I wasn't aware
that Steele was that aware of extropy...

If a post-Singularity entity is capable of
anything within the laws of physics (damn
bottlenecks) wouldn't it already have to be the
most efficient information processor possible?
Otherwise you could say that we are capable of
anything within physical law (i.e. I can build a
jupiter brain if I just evolve jupiter brain
building swirly things out of the top of my head).

Are you aware of how crystal structures grow and produce more crystals?
I don't know if this is an example of what you're asking for, but it is
a great example of how simple structures can grow and reproduce very
quickly, with the "more organized" structures being more likely to form
than the "disorganized" structures.

Imagine little microscopic cubes of salt bouncing around in a solution.
They are randomly sticking together and breaking apart.  They are not
too sticky, such that they are permanently glued together, but they are
not to unsticky that they always bounce apart.

Sometimes the cubes randomly touch perfectly aligned such that an entire
square side is right against another square side.  When they stick like
this, they form a larger crystal that perfectly lined up.  This perfect
alignment is much rarer than the random alignments, but sometimes it
happens.

More often, the cubes randomly touch in an imperfect alignment such that
only part of a square side is touching the other cube.  Some will
randomly stick half-on and half-off another cube.  In this case, the
surface area that is stuck together is half that of the perfectly
aligned cubes above.  Their sticking power is half that of the cubes
above.

The more perfectly aligned a cube is when it sticks, the more of its
square side is stuck to the other cube.  The more surface area that is
stuck, the more likely it is to stay together.  The better-aligned cubes
are much more likely to stick together than the poorly-aligned cubes.
By randomly bouncing around, cubes are more likely to line up in rows
and columns, forming larger cubes, than they are to stick randomly and
form noncubic structures.  Like magnets aligning themselves up when
stuck together, these cubic crystals will line up and construct larger
crystal cubes just by chance.  These cubes grow longer and larger, until
the large structures can't hold their own weight, and pieces break off
to start new cubic structures.

This happens relatively fast.  This is not the slow random chance that
the crystals will happen to fall together in a big block.  This is the
fast self-assembling nature of sticky cubes.  They naturally fall into
self-arranged patterns of organization just like coins naturally fall on
one side, but rarely on their edge, because they are much more likely to
do so.

This example has cubic structures being formed by cubes that are sticky
on all six sides.  For molecules that are not cubic, but say hexagon,
with stickiness around the edge but not the top or bottom, they will
tend to stick together in a plane, forming membranes rather than lumps.
DNA and RNA are string-like structures, only sticky on the very ends.
It is easy for molecules to add on the end and grow the strings, but
breaking apart the middle is much less likely to occur.

Contrary to popular belief, random chance with molecules is not like
shaking a box of cards and having them fall together in a card-house
structure.  It is more like shaking a box of magnet cubes, and having
them stick together.

No.  I have not seen anyone here express this view recently.  I have
seen one side misunderstand and misrepresent this straw-man argument as
belonging to the other side.  Those who have posted objections to the
copy-and-kill method of uploading seem to clearly say that they wouldn't
mind replacing every biological neuron in their brain with an artificial
one.  The objection is *not* whether another substrate can "capture"
some aspect of a living organism.

I never claimed a divergence in what they see.
I claimed a divergence in which wall they point to.
They are not pointing toward the same wall.

Why are you ignoring my test and rewriting one of your own?
I agree that you can invent a test that doesn't prove you
wrong.  I am more interested in your response to my test
which does prove you wrong.

This is a straw-man.  Your original example did not have this mark, nor
does my objection require such a mark.  You invented this mark as being
required for my objection, then you argued against this mark as being
invalid.  You did not counter my objection or even address it.  You set
up a straw-man position and then tore it down.

Can I ask you to respond to my actual objection?  Isn't it impossible
for both copies to choose a wall, choose a direction to move the table
toward the wall, and have their choices be the same?

Says who? Prove to me that it's not the same wall.
Prove to me that these are two different people.

They both point to their left, they see both of
their copies point to their right, where's the
disagreement?

I'm just amazed at your theories of location and
indentity. Tell me, what makes the walls different
in this test? How can we tell they are different?
How do you know there are two different people?

	This is more or less coincidental.  Think about where pain is
located to better understand this.  Our knowledge of our fingers are
not the real fingers, but simply a conscious representation of them in
our brain.  When we hurt our fingers the pain, which is produced by
our brain, feels like it is in the finger because the pain is in our
conscious representation of our finger, not in the actual flesh and
bone finger.  (That is why people experience "phantom limb pain" in an
amputated limb!  Amputating a limb doesn't amputate the conscious
model of that limb in their brain.)  The pain isn't in the finger, it
is in the brain.

	Everything we know is a phenomenal conscious representation in
our brain.  There is an entire world, constructed of quale inside our
brain that models, bassed on the data received by our senses, the
world beyond our senses.  Despite our optimized intuition, the two are
not the same thing.  (If they were, virtual reality would not work.)
One is a cause of perception, the other is the effect.  We are not
really aware of what is beyond our senses, including our limbs, but
only of this model of what is beyond our senses in our brain.  So, if
it "feels" like our mind is "behind" our eyeballs, it is because our
knowledge of ourselves is constructed in this manner by our brain in
our conscious model of reality.  Our brain has a conscious image of
ourselves, including the head or skull, with a representation of
ourselves, just behind our eyeballs in this model.  And all of this
model, along with all the other conscious knowledge our brain has, is
entirely inside our real skull.

> Note, if you ask a blind and deaf person where they feel their mind
> is, they will reply: "In my fingertips".....

	Exactly, the model of reality that is produced by these
people, or their knowledge, is different than ours.  If someone
altered a seeing and hearing person's brain properly, (this can also
occur naturally in dreams) they, too, would feel like they existed in
their fingertips.  So, the fact that it happens to be "the visual
stereoscopic center" is simply because our brain models our knowledge
of ourselves that way.  It may be efficient for our brain to do it
that way, but it need not necessarily be that way.  Anything is
possible in this world of dreams that our brain uses to model or
consciously know about reality.  I like to call this world produced by
our brain, that is our conscious knowledge, that is the result of the
cause and effect perception process not the initial cause, the spirit
world.  Our true location is really entirely within this model of all
of reality which is entirely in our brains.  The true "US" or "I" is
not constructed of flesh and bones, but of qualia, or if you will,
this spiritual conscious or whatever phenomenon that is produced by
our brain.

	And that's why out of body experiences are so common.  Within
such a dream, you are out of the conscious model of you body, but
though you are out of your conscious knowledge of your skull, you are
still within the conscious dream world that is entirely within the
real bone that is your real skull.  One skull is made of bone, the
other is made of phenomenal qualia, is entirely inside the other, and
is merely a conscious representation or knowledge of the other.

	When you realize that this is what conscious knowledge is, you
realize that true out of body experiences are absurd and impossible,
and that they really must simply be dreams entirely contained within
conscious model of reality no part of which can ever leave the bounds
of our real skull.  At least not YET!

Bruno Beaufils, Jean-Paul Delahaye, Philippe Mathieu have done extensive

They have come to different conclusions than Robert Axelrod did.

I am beginning work on a short essay (for publication) about governmental
involvement in the development of a particular new technology and am looking
for instructive examples of this phenomena -- positive and negative -- from
history, both recent and less so.  I would appreciate any such examples the
list might suggest and, especially, any pointers to good discussions of the
impact of governmental regulation on technology and industrial development.

Thanks in advance.

A rather interesting article by Michael Malone in Upside
- see <http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/story?id=35927f000>.
He discusses current infatuation of the media with high
tech, worries for the future of medium-IQ masses, points
out that the expectations of the technological revolution
are not accompanied by careful analysis of "implications
of such a profound historical discontinuity", and draws
some interesting historical parallels.

  Comprehensive, well written, and probably to a certain
degree symptomatic of at least some of the upper-middle-
intellectual attitudes to the explosive development of events.

I think the text could be improved though if it contained
not only the references to the possible scale of the expected
"discontinuity", such as Moore's "Law", and relevant historical
analogs, but also some interesting ideas on its long-term
qualitative changes in the nature of humans and their
agglomerations, as well as suggestions of which should be
pursued and which should be avoided. (Most interesting enabling
technologies, such as AI, ER, nanotech, uploading, etc. are not
even mentioned, let alone what they could *do*).

Well, maybe after such articles convince the thinking public
that the subject deserves serious consideration, some people
will start thinking of such things, and pay more attention to
extropian ideas.  Don't know if facing a huge, disoriented,
horrified, and demanding crowd then would me more enjoyable
than watching today's clueless proto-conscious technosocium
cheerfully trot towards this discontinuity...
So far humans have been much better in bringing the imperatives
of functional development into existence, than in understanding
what they are doing - so maybe a certain degree of public
cluelessness is even beneficial for technological progress 
at this point?

Has there ever been an extropian video conference event?  It would be nice
to attach a face to some of the regulars on this list (as well as some of
the irregulars ; ) .  I wonder about the quality of the communications but
the spontaneity might be an intersting new dynamic.  We could even make the
event topical (e.g the egoists vs. the utilitarians). ; )

During the upload discussion, many people claimed that if two objects
were identical except for location, that they were the same object.  Not
just two of the same type of object, but literally the same object.
They would be counted as one object.  The claim applied to an original
and an exact duplicate upload in the same room.  Some claim that there
is only one person, one body, one brain, one physical entity.

The seems irrational to me.  We know that atoms are interchangeable.
All hydrogen atoms, for example, are identical.  Any two hydrogen atoms
can be switched with no discernible effect.

Does this mean that there is only one hydrogen atom in the entire
universe?  One helium atom?  One of each of about 100 elements, meaning
the entire universe consists of about 100 atoms?  This seems to be
mysticism at its best, claiming that we are all one, and that
distinctions between me and thee are illusions.  This is the first time
I have heard this theory outside religious mysticism.  Do other
extropians really feel this way?

This is getting too silly to continue.  Are you claiming that the square
room does not contain four walls because the walls are identical?  A
square contains only one side?  A rectangle only contains two sides?  An
equilateral triangle has one side, while a symmetrical triangle has two
sides and an asymmetrical triangle has three sides?

You are the one with strange theories of location and identity.

I would surmise that on average the forecasts anyone might make today about
2098 are no more accurate than the forecast an ancestor might have made in
1798 about 1998.  Perhaps *far less* accurate, if we really can expect a
Vingean discontinuity in the intelligence that is brought to bear on
problems somewhere around 2050 if not decades earlier.  

I also suppose that we are better placed to be able to imagine such a
Singularity than any ancestor in 1898, although Nikolay Aleksandrovich
Berdyayev might have managed it (he was 24 at the time).

True, but not very helpful. Our 1898 guy (say, Mark Twain) would likely
assign probabilities to a human future and ignore the post-SI future.
'gene and I assert that it's essentially impossible to select among
physically possible post-SI futures. Your argument is that our prediction
is therefore better than Mr Twain's. I agree, but I don't think we should
get much credit for this answer, and it doesn't help us to further refine
our uniform probability distribution. In particular, if the SI is a Mark
Twain fan, it may decide that Mark Twain's vision is superior to all others.
Would that mean mark Twain's prediction was superior? It would be correct, but
not for the right reason (i.e., incorrect time trajectory.)

Oh, what the heck, let's give Robin a bit more than that. Since we
have a better understanding of the laws of physics, we can exclude more.
Also, the curve leading to the singularity was much more subtle and
harder to discern in 1898 than now, so Einstein, Hertz, Maxwell, Twain,
et. al. can be excused for not predicting a singularity. They can be
excused for believing that human culture would persist to 2098. We cannot.

 the four part series called science of impossible had some
good exposure for extropians in the first episode, with
max more and ralph merkle etc.  unfortunately the series
went directly into the trash can thereafter, with the final
installment talking about esp, telekinesis and invisible
people, etc.  i was at first delighted, then embarrassed
that the extropian name was associated with that

Transhumanist technologies have the potential to preserve
existing ecosystems. Reasonable non-transhuman extrapolations
of existing human culture have no chance of preserving the
current ecosystem.

I can in fact think of a reasonable way to calculate the temperature of
a black hole: I can consult the literature or I can consult an expert,
and after I have done so I can reasonably expect to be able to evaluate
the result from first principles. I cannot consult the literature or
an expert on the motivational psychology of SIs, and if I could do so
I doubt that I could evaluate the result from first principles. I
cannot reliably evaluate information from books or experts on human
motivational psychology, much less SI motivational psychology, and IMO
neither can you or anyone else: the field simply is not at the same level
of development as is the thermodynamics of black holes.

Human motivation is less complex than the motivations of ants?

Robin, the reason I produced the list of motivations and actions was
to attempt to provide specific examples. Can you reccomend a way for
me, or another human or group of humans or construct of humans (short of
an SI) to reliably assign probabilities to that list?

The difference is that the SI will plausibly be able
to plan and execute the most efficient way to build whatever
information processing it needs. It will already be in control
of its own augmentation. We are not yet at that point, so you
cannot plan or execute those neat swirly things. (please send
me the schematics ;-) ). The point at which you have direct
concious control of your own augmentation is the singularity.

Is there any way to have announcements made about extropian appearances
beforehand?  I always seem to hear about extropian appearances after
they happen.  Why don't extropians publicize their appearances here?

But in the real world that's not why people think a tape recorder is  
unintelligent and unconscious. Most people don't have the slightest idea of 
how a tape recorder works, much less the human brain, they don't believe a 
tape recorder is conscious is because it doesn't act that way, in other words
they use the Turing Test.

I agree its a reasonable assumption that other people who act intelligently 
are conscious, its a reasonable assumption that an intelligent robot is  
conscious too, but a reasonable assumption  is not the same as a proof.

I think you're a little confused, this wall pointing table moving example was  
yours not mine. Personally I never cared for it much.

If they were standing side by side and not facing each other they might have 
an irresistible urge to grab the round table in the center of their 
symmetrical room and move it to their right. It all depends on the angular 
orientation you decided to put the two copies into when you made them in the 
round duplicating chamber, or at least the angular orientation of their sense
organs. Trying to derive identity from angular orientation will not get you 
any further than you previous attempt to do it with linear orientation, 
position is just a non starter.

I'm a neutral, I am a member of neither the pro nor the anti mark on wall  
faction, I just pointed out the consequences of both. 

I fear this is starting to degenerate into a heated argument over room design 
and interior decorating,  to try to prevent that let me concede for the 
fourth or fifth time that if the  copies receive different information from 
their senses, for whatever reason, then there would indeed be two people not 
one in the room.

IMO, about 50%. Domestic violence would remain, as well as political
and military.

It's called prevention. In the late 1800s public health officials were
given sufficient power to force sanitation and water purity. A similar
approach, treating violence as a public health problem could be implemented
if there was the political will for it.

There's another option here. Instead of bang! make an independent copy,
how about making a copy which is connected with the originial with a truly
high bandwidth interface. So much so that it is one individual with two
bodies. Now, gradually reduce the bandwidth.......

Your arguments suggest objects have independent
location (their location is not relative to
another object).

Again, I ask:

What makes the walls different in this test?
How can we tell they are different?
How do you know there are two different people?

These are all assumptions that you make; yet you
refuse to explain why.

Thanks, Natasha, for the review of this fascinating exhibit -- it really gave
the flavor of some of the core media and concepts of transhumanist art.  Can
you post up to the list some web pointers to examples of MathArt and ALifeArt
like the material that was exhibited?

A couple of comments:

I prefer the introductory clause: "Transhumanists advocate the use..." as more
direct than what is suggested.  The reader will easily comprehend that
"transhumanists" are the people who exemplify "transhumanism", thereby
avoiding "is the philosophy which".  As the Emperor said to Mozart in
"Amadeus", "Too many notes!"  In the same vein, I suggest using the word
"limits" instead of "limitations".

I also suggest avoiding "and transform the human condition" as part of the
very first sentence in the FAQ, for two reasons.  First, "transforming the
human condition" is a VERY big subject and one in which one can find much
ambiguity.  Thus, it raises more questions than it answers.  Second, as a
potential "recruiting" device, the FAQ should take the reader into our ideas
in easy steps.  While the core transhumanist vision is indeed grandiose, I
find that taking things a little slowly for the uninitiated is the best
rhetorical path to persuasion.

Again, this seems a little accelerated for a first paragraph.  I would suggest
the following:

The accelerating pace of technological development and scientific
understanding of the human animal is creating the possibility of a whole new
stage in the history of the human race.  In the very near future we will face
the prospect of such technologies as real artificial intelligence, new kinds
of cognitive tools that combine artificial intelligence with new interface
technology, powerful new molecular biological engineering and non-biological
molecular nanotechnology.  The consequences of these developments will include
the prospect of meaningful augmentation of the human being in fundamental
ways.  Realistic possibilities flowing from these developments include
significant increases in human mental and physical power and vastly extended
life spans.  They also include the possibility of great harm to human life as
we know it.  Even though these are extreme possibilities, they are taken
seriously by an increasing number of scientists and scientifically literate
philosophers and social thinkers.

Here I would avoid the use of the word "mere" as potentially off-putting.  I
suggest the following:

... to such a degree as to be no longer a simple "human being" in the original
sense of the word.

True, current development is not sustainable. Transhuman technologies
_could_ preserve/rebuild virtually anything (and more), however, they
can destroy a planetary ecosystem within minutes, if not seconds. So
we cannot answer this question reliably, just now.

Two systems in the same quantum state are indistinguishable. You can
find the outline of a proof for that in the appendix of Tipler's 
'The Physics of Immortality'. I don't understand which 'counting' 
you refer to, but that proof says there cannot be any measurement 
procedure to distinguish one object from the other. Finis.
 
Of course this is pretty useless, for no macroscopic objects occupy
the same quantum state. But we are talking about the user front end,
right? If _I_, the user, cannot distinguish between an object, and 
a copy, then it is meaningless to make the distinction between them, 
obviously?

Addressing your position re discontinous (destructive)
uploading. Current physics seems to forbid realtime in vivo scans with
enough resolution without destroying the object. It would be ideal to
have working incremental/gradual uploading before we croak, but it's
availability is highly uncertain, because it is pretty difficult to do even
with mechanosynthetically produced devices. So a destructive scan of a 
vitrified cerebrum ("digitizing neuroanatomy") and a computational
model of it with sufficient precision is currently the best we can
hope for. Lucky thing this buys you time, lots of it, because
basically no deterioration occurs to tissue in glass matrix (let's not 
discuss the involved topic of suspension damage right now). So there is no 
original to compare for harvey-nature, so we have to devise some other 
metric for harveyness. So you can check some operation signatures:
high-level ones (behavioural), fMRI/MEG/EEG/firing pattern
fingerprint, etc. etc. Obviously the metric for harveyinity is not
boolean, but fuzzy (reality is always messy, right?). You have 
a region, not a point in persona space, as you obviously lose 
information due to the suspension damage inflicted, have uncertainties 
due the limited emulation resolution, etc. If you could have recorded 
lots of additional information, as somehow tracked your cellular
growth, and recorded anything you saw and did during your life from 
your perspective, you could use that as a source of constraints to 
narrow down the region in persona space labeled 'Harvey'. But I 
very much doubt we need _that_ much detail, because the changes 
you have to cope with during your daily life, especially towards 
the end of it, are (hopefully) so very much more drastic than the 
artefacts due to the uploading construction and operation process. 
You seem to value personal continuity so very much, but you dispense 
with it when you go to nonREM sleep, suffer a head concussion, total 
anaesthesia or a stopped bloodflow for several minutes. So this 
definition of personality is very fragile it gets violated
habitually. The question of persona trajectories being divergent 
has been handled with, already, so I believe we can skip that.

Summa summarum I think your attitude towards preservation (or failure
thereof) of persona in an discontinuous upload is not rational. I,
too, have felt emotional discomfort with discontinuous uploads in the 
past. Being a question of faith (does it harvey-nature, or not?), it 
is best addressed from a point of faith; at least I have found it so.

No, it means that if one hydrogen atom is in a process and you interchange it  
with another identical hydrogen atom there will be no discernible effect, 
not discernible by anyone, not even by Harvey Newstrom. This is true for any 
process, even the process in the brain of Harvey Newstrom or his copy that

Because they have nothing better, yes.  However, 
wouldn't you agree that knowing how a tape recorder
works is a much surer route to knowing whether it is
conscious?  IOW, the Turing Test sorta works for this
purpose, but it is not the best way to tell.

I would say that while consciousness in general is

complex than that.

Without the proper instruments, I can't tell
the elements that some indeterminate 
block of matter is made of.  Does that mean
that I cannot detect matter?  

I may not be able to detect *some* 
features of time, but that it exists, I can.

What would this do?  Connecting two copies and then disconnecting them
seems like it would leave them in their original unconnected state.  I'm
not sure what you're trying to accomplish by doing this.  I don't see
how this relates my statement above.

Are you deliberately being dishonest?

You deleted the list of six geometrical absurdities that I asked about
in the very next sentence.

You keep selectively editing my responses to eliminate my objections,
eliminate my questions for you, eliminate my test-cases for your theory,
eliminate my list of logical fallacies you have committed, and cut down
my lists of possibilities to only those items which do not disprove your
theory.  This misrepresents my actual response, and then you refute the
distorted response that you have created for me.

You have done this about a dozen times in a row, and I am getting tired
of giving you the benefit of the doubt.

Until you can respond to what I actually post, and not to your edited
versions, we cannot have an honest debate.

Yes, I created the pointing table moving example.  *You* responded by
postulating "only if there was a mark on the wall." Then you dismissed
my objection because "if it did have such a mark then the room would no
longer have cylindrical symmetry."  I.E., *you* invented the part of my
argument that you later refuted.  This was the straw-man point.

But then they wouldn't be seeing the same thing.  One would be on the
left, while the other would be on the right.  One would have to lead
with the table, while the other would have to follow.  They would know
which one was the leader and which one was the follower.  Their
identities would diverge, by your definition.  Again, the example does
not prevent the divergence of perception that you require.

Yes, we agreed to that before the symmetrical room example.  I believe
that you asserted that the symmetrical room would prevent such
divergence.  I believe that I have shown that it does not.  Are we now
agreed on this latter point?

I think everyone would agree that they are identical, but are they one
system?  By counting, I mean you have two molecules of water.  They are
indistinguishable from each other.  Both are identical H2O.  Are there
two molecules of water, or one molecule of water somehow existing in two
locations?  How would you count indistinguishable systems.  The debate
lead to the point that some claimed there were multiple
indistinguishable systems, where some claimed that there was only one
such system, seemingly in multiple places concurrently.

Is this because of random motions, such as Browning(?) random vibration?
That is, each macro object may look the same, but all their atoms can't
hold in the exact same positon as its copy, because the atoms randomly
move around?

Yes, for utility purposes of one of the objects.  But in counting total
objects, they must be distinquished by position to count them.  The
example I was quoting lead to the situation where a square room was
declared to have one wall, because it was "meaningless to make a
distinction between them."  There still are x number of objects, even if
they are all identical, right?  When two objects become identical or
indistinguishable, they don't suddenly merge into a single object, do
they?

This is probably the most useful point in the entire history of copy
debates!  As far as we know, it is impossible to produce such an
identical copy, so all the copy-and-kill scenarios are theoretical and
philosophical arguments.

For my money, I would like to see one neuron at a time replaced with a
new one.  I think everyone has agreed that this is an acceptable way to
end up in a mechanical body.  It also seems more likely given laws of
physics, and probably cheaper with lower technology.

Good, this seems to agree with my understanding of physics.  As long as
you count each body, each brain, each atom as separate although
identical.  Some people on this list disagree that there can be more
than one of any identical objects.  They seem to count one body, one
brain, one wall, one hydrogen atom, as long as they are
indistinguishable.

Where is the list of potential FAQ questions?  I didn't save the
original, and now I would like to try to address some of the questions.

I currently am thinking that short sound-bite answers are best.  I also
think that addressing mystical questions with mystical answers is better
than rejecting the question as invalid.  I'm not sure if good answers
can be made to all the questions using these two postulated goals.

Hmm, let's see. (Btw, would you let me have a copy of your algorithm

Anything from zero (we can't go negative, can we?) to some 
absurdly (really really transastronomically postabsurdly) high number.

something by then, that is, things like timelike closed curves and

If physical mass has a meaning after some timespace engineering (show
me a proof you can't do that by 2098). Even if you can't build these, 
I still have no idea how many persons can really fit into the volume 
of a glass of water, whether quantum computers, or no. What's the mass

Age? (Well, if you go Lamarckian, identity stops having its canonical
meaning). Death? What's that?

If identity still exists, as does timespace.

Just a couple of days ago, two new book reviews were added to the
Discriminator section. I believe there are other pieces in the works. Sasha
is the person to ask about what's coming and when.

The newsletter is overdue, for which my apologies. I've been preoccupied
with earning a living. I'm working on it this weekend. The new issue will
contain quite a bit of news.

I also haven't had time to work on the EXTRO 4 conference, though I do
still intend to make it happen during 1999.

Extropy Institute is a nonprofit corporation in good standing with directors
(including me) and officers.  The board of directors does indeed meet
(although usually by telephone), and all proper records (including financial
records) and filings are kept to maintain the Institute's nonprofit status.

The Institute has suffered over the years from the problems that plague any
organization run almost entirely on volunteer labor.  For much of its history
(including right now), no one has drawn a salary or received any other sort of
payment from ExI.    When officers have been paid, it has not really been a
fair compensation for their efforts.  By and large, the organization runs on
the efforts of its officers, in recent years almost all of which has meant Max
More's uncompensated efforts, along with a lot of valuable work and support
from Natasha Vita More.

In the last year the officers and directors of ExI have been trying hard to
develop a viable model for the organization utilizing the economies provided
by the Web and other resources wherever they can be found.  For instance,
Extropy Magazine is now an online publication.  Sasha Chislenko is now the
chief editor and he has been actively developing new material for Extropy
Online.  The newsletter will also be moving online.  We're also working on an
arrangement for handling office operations and expenses that should make the
organization much more vital -- more news about which shortly.  These moves
will decrease ExI's costs.

As the list regulars know, we've been trying for the last year to develop a
new, richer environment for online discussions; something more articulated
than the simple, open list.  So far, this hasn't happened, but the project
continues in "any day now" status -- again suffering from the intermittent
nature of volunteer labor.

There won't be an EXTRO conference this year, simply because Max hasn't had
the time to devote to such a big project.  (And believe me, organizing the
EXTRO conferences is a VERY BIG job.)  We are very hopeful that EXTRO 4 will
happen in 1999 and that it will be the pre-eminent world gathering of
transhumanists that the conferences always have been, but it is a much greater
likelihood if we can find significant corporate or individual financial
sponsorship.

As an open organization supported by its members, ExI is always looking for
input of good ideas from its membership.  As someone who has worked in the
organization now for over a year, however, I can say that good ideas alone
will not enrich the organization -- we need real committment from people to do
real work on a regular schedule to make projects viable.

No, there are still four walls. You said that if
the two copies pointed left, they'd be pointing at
different walls. I am merely asking how you *know*
they are different walls. Considering their are
two people in the room and they both share
identical data. Since they are both pointing to
their left and seeing their copy point to
its right. Why is there a divergence?

As far as I can tell, you believe the walls have
an independent location. I am perhaps guilty of
"selectively editing [your] responses to eliminate
[your] objections" because I'm trying to establish
where our opinions differ. As I have noted time
and time again, I believe it is in our concepts of
location. I apologise if I can be accused of any
arrogance or dishonesty, this is certainly not
what I intending.

I had hoped the idea of the room would help
concrete the image of two identical entities
acting as redundancy. It works for me, but I am of
a biased viewpoint (as are you).

No, a square has four sides, a rectangle four, and
so on. In my thought experiment you simply cannot
distinguish between the identity and location of
the walls, and thus the copies will not diverge.

> You are the one with strange theories of

So:

What makes the walls different in this test?
How can we tell they are different?
How do you know there are two different people?

True, but not relevant. The orignal question makes the implicit assumption
that our existing society can somehow preserve the environment. Unless we
attack the assumption, we give away our strongest environmental argument.

Transhumanism aims to increase the scope of human life in all dimensions,
including time.  The level of wisdom, knowledge and experience that can be
achieved in the short span of a single, unaugmented human life span is one of
the limits transhumanists seek to overcome through the use of technology.
  
>  Isn't transhumanism tampering with nature?


Transhumanists reject a bright line between "man" and "nature": From its
beginnings, the development of our species has been a process of positive
feedback with our technology, broadly defined as those created tools we use
that are not part of our simple genetically endowed physical structure or
behavioral repertoire. From the time of the simplest stone tools and most
primitive linguistic constructs, humanity has been engaged in extending its
capacities through the use of increasingly powerful "artificial" tools.  Thus,
"tampering with nature" is the very thing that makes us human.  Transhumanists
simply seek to continue that process -- wisely -- onto a new level of
sophistication.

>  Won't transhuman technologies make us inhuman?

Transhumanists seek technological means to enhance those qualities of humanity
we value the most: Our creativity and insight into the world in which we live.
Far from making us inhuman, the increased power transhumanists seek promises a
liberation from the very limits that cause "inhumanity".

Axelrod didn't reach any "conclusions".  He reported the
results of his experiments, and speculated--honestly--about
what they might imply.  Axelrod has far too much integrity
as a scientist to call any of that a "conclusion".

A few points to the inspiring discussion of this inspiring film:

The whole thing is very familiar to any person who once lived
behind the Iron Curtain.
Instead of staged personal accidents (father's death) the Powers
manufacture lots of stories about accidents that happened with
other people in their attempts to overstep territorial or behavioral
boundaries, and even if you are really free and smart, and suspect
that you are being fooled, there is no way to find out what of all this
is actually true and to what extent...

I knew many people who, once the door with the sign "Exit" appeared
in the wall, didn't take that step as they didn't feel enough strength and
courage to face whatever it is outside (and this out of very few people
who were actually looking for the door).  Practically all those who made
it out created a comfortable limited suburban nest in the new world, and
still feel attached to the artificial culture of their first artificial world.
Nobody starts looking for the doors out of the new world.  It's scary.
NOBODY.
(Any other former dissidents from the communist block on this list?)
          ---------------------------
It may be even more difficult to experience unintentional deceit.
If you are fooled on purpose on a small piece of land by a small group
of people who occasionally slip, you can discover it.  But what do you
do if you are surrounded by millions of people who stay within some
idiotic boundaries (they are behavioral/cultural so that you can't even
see them) and have created a culture that not only justifies, but glorifies
these boundaries, and they all keep showing those boxes of cereal to
each other, and you can't extract a confession of deceit from them
even if you torture them - because they sincerely believe that this *is*
real life.
So transcending the collective unconscious insanity of the mundane
seems a lot harder than getting out of a generally comfy and somewhat
leaky movie plot.

I saw a similar film in about 1987 in Russia - it was Polish, called
"New Amazons", or "Sexmission". Exmission" means "Expulsion,
or exile In Polish as I was explained. A scene of hitting "the end of
the world" - there, a painted "after-nuclear-holocaust" dome - was
almost identical.  The film was heavily censored (I couldn't find a full
version since), but still enough was left for the bitter irony of the

No. If the table is moved to one side the  room is no longer symmetrical.

If you have an innate asymmetry and a passion for moving things to the right 
and I put you into a symmetrical room you will soon rearrange things so that 
the room is no longer symmetrical. If I put both you and your copy facing 
each other in such a room you will both  engage in your respective hobby but 
your activities will cancel each other out and the room will remain 
symmetrical, both will receive the exact same information from their senses
so nothing will diverge. If they're side by side then, contrary to what you 
said, they can find a way to agree on a direction to move the table, however 
things will rapidly become asymmetrical and so the two will diverge into 
separate beings.

In example  with them facing each other the fingers of the two will indeed be
pointing toward different walls but I don't find that disturbing, if one copy 
was in London  and the other in Paris they would also be pointing at 
different walls, but as long as the walls are identical the information 
received from the walls will be the same and no divergence will happen. 
If you have doubts that  the information really is the same then convert it
to a binary sequence and  see if the train of ones and zeros is the same.

In none of these scenarios does the position of the brain of the "original" 
or the "copy" make the slightest difference, only the information the brains 
receive is important and that's a function of the position of the sense  
organs.

It's far beyond today's technology but Nanotechnology could do it and I know

I'd like to do it that way too, at least if I was one of the very early  
uploaders, the reason is very practical, it would be the best way to catch  
small bugs in the replacement protocol before they became large bugs.  
Philosophically speaking however the speed of the change would make no

That's true but I certainly don't think you'd have to go as far as putting  a 
copy of you in the same quantum state for it to be you. That's vast overkill.

Still not quite macroscopic but they are getting bigger and the progress is 
remarkable, the current record was set just this week by Daniel Kleppner and 
Tom Greytak of MIT. They put 100 million hydrogen atoms in the same quantum 
state by making a Bose Einstein condensate, what makes it even more 
impressive is that it's much harder to do it with Hydrogen than with more
massive alkali atoms. That's 10 times as many atoms as the previous record 
that was made just a few months ago.

I just discovered a collection of short stories called "Immortals", edited
by Jack Dann & Gardner Dozois. Authors include Greg Egan, Brian Aldiss,
Robert Silverberg, and Jack Vance. The editors themselves express clear
support for the desirability of immortality/greatly extended life span,
though they note that the stories are mixed in their attitudes.

What about measuring location to distinguish multiple copies?  If you
have an H2O molecule at your location, and I have an H2O molecule at my
location, how many do you count?  They are "the same", "identical",
"indistinguishable", etc.  Are viewing "the same" molecule in the sense
that there is one molecule?  Or are we viewing two of "the same" type of
molecule?

> Of course this is pretty useless, for no macroscopic objects occupy

Of course.  Random molecular motion means that nano-built objects with
the exact same atomic configuration as each other will immediately start
to diverge at the molecular level.  Their function and basic macro-level
design may remain, but they cannot be "exactly" the same down to the
position of every atom.

For utilizing a single object there is no difference and any of a number
of copies may be used because they are indistinguishable.  In this
sense, it is meaningless to distinguish between objects.

For utilizing multiple objects, there must be a way to distinguish
between them to count or measure the total number of such objects.  The
distinguishing factor is usually by location.  Calculations involving
total number, amount, volume, mass, energy or usefulness must have an
accurate count or measure of objects.  Two gallons of fuel may be
indistinguishable, but there is a difference between having one gallon
of fuel and two gallons of fuel.  For this requirement, claiming that
"it is meaningless to make a distinction between having the first gallon
of fuel and having the second gallon of fuel" would destroy the system.

The counting or measuring of the total number of objects is important.
Some people are equating "a reference to two identical indistinguishable
objects that are the same" with "two references to the same identical
indistinguishable object".  This confuses the total count of objects,
and we end up arguing over how many people, how many walls, how many
bodies, etc.  These are the two cases I am trying to distinguish.

Very good point.  It seems that the question of whether this method
would work is moot since we can't try it anyway.  I'm personally glad,
because I did not approve of this method.  I think better methods are
available.

I have no problem with where this is leading.  If we do not end up with
two Harvey's, then I am not worried about one being destroyed later.
Any connection of the old and new body that transfers data or atoms from
the old to the new, building a new body while the old one is used up,
sounds like a perfect description of uploading to me.

I think this is best.

I think these only apply to the old body and brain.  The new body does
not need to keep these same attributes for the consciousness to be the
same.  A computer would have electrical or photonic energy signatures,
and not the bioelectric ones.  The fingerprints would be whatever we
designed on its appendages.

> [lots of fuzzy stuff snipped]

Actually, I have a very fuzzy definition of myself.  If I suffered total
amnesia, I would not commit suicide.  I would want to live on, even if
it meant starting from scratch.  I think it would still be me, just
starting with a clean slate.  A lot of my subconscious processes and
human consciousness or whatever, would still apply.  I would have basic
communications functions and would start learning and experiencing life
right away.  My relationships to my family, career, and other things
would have to be relearned, but I could try to re-aquire them.  Although
it would be a great loss, it would not be a total loss which is death.
If an upload even captured these minimal basics of me, while my
conscious memory and data was radically altered, I would still call this
me.  I would prefer to preserve as much data as I can.

Too many people have attributed this belief to me.  I have NEVER
questioned that the new upload was a Harvey.  I am sure that it is.  My
problem is that in the duplication scenario, the old body still
contained a Harvey, and I didn't want it killed.  I have no objection to
uploading, and believe the methodology for uploading can be described
today.  I just don't think that putting a bullet through the brain of a
living, active Harvey is a good idea in any case.  I prefer the upload
scenarios that do not contain this attribute.

My rule of thumb:
- Killing the old body still containing Harvey is "bad".
- Creating the new body containing Harvey is "good".
The copy-and-kill scenario contains *both* attributes.

The same way everyone reading this note can look at their own square
room and tell that there are four different walls in four directions.
You call them "right", "left", "frontward" and "behind".  You can count
them and tell that they are in four different directions, at four
differing distances, at four different angles, and you have given them
four differing labels.  Even if the walls look identical, this same
method of counting and naming walls still holds.  There is no doubt that
there are four walls in four locations.

Each chooses a wall and points left.  Their actions do not diverge at
first, because they are identical copies.  However, each copy sees the
arm under its own nose pointing left, while it sees the arm not under
his own nose pointing right.  Each copy sees his own arm pointing toward
the "left" wall, while the other is pointing toward the "right" wall.
The directions of the two arms pointing are in opposite directions.  The
do not converge toward the same wall.  They diverge to different walls
on opposite sides of the room.  Even though their choices was the same,
the results are different.  Even though the agreed on where to point in
thought, they actually ended up pointing in different directions because
they are each pointing from a different location.  If they try to move
the table "left" toward the wall they have chosen, each will be fighting
the other because their goal of destination wall are divergent.  Each is
pulling toward a different wall.  Even if you can't tell the walls
apart, the direction of the two pulls are obviously in opposite
directions since they fight each other.  Although their thoughts start
out the same, they quickly diverge in result and goals and actions.
They will be in conflict even on simple tasks such as moving the table
or choosing a wall.

> As far as I can tell, you believe the walls have
> an independent location.

Why?  Don't you?  You agreed above that there are four walls.  Are you
now claiming that all four walls are in the same location?  If you are
not claiming this, why are you asking me to prove that they are
different?

Thank you for that.  What is your defintion of location, and how does it
differ from mine.  Does your concept of location cause you to request
proof that the different walls of a square are different?  Do you not
agree that they are different, or are merely exercising my proof system
to see how I define location?

> What makes the walls different in this test?
> How can we tell they are different?

The are distinguishable by:
- location relative to the observer
- direction relative to the observer
- distance from the observer
- angle of view from the observer
- different designations assigned by the observer (right, left, etc.)

> How do you know there are two different people?

As above, they cannot continue to think identically, act identically,
and achieve identical results.  They will therefore diverge in thought,
deed, or experience.  The two people will think differently, act
differently, or experience differently.  They cannot remain identical.

I finally understand what you are saying.  The binary information
perceived by the two persons are the same.  They stay synchronized and
identical because their experiences are symmetrical and identical.  You
don't care that they are pointing to different walls because their
visual views and binary record of the different walls would look
identical to them.  Both can perceive that they are not pointing toward
the same wall, but they both perceive their wall in the same way, and
perceive the other wall as being a different wall in the same way.

It is really a clever example to keep the two identical copies
synchronized and seeing the same thing.  I think we agree that if they
pushed through the walls to the outside world, they would diverge?  Or
if a sound was heard through the walls from one side, they would
diverge?  Of if a person tried to interact with them, they would
diverge?  Only by keeping them locked in the perfect room would you call
them the same person because they were identical?

For the sake of argument, I will concede that you are right and
everything being symmetrical would keep the copies synchronized.  As
long as they see the same thing and cannot distinguish anything
different, they will not diverge.

However, back to the upload example, I think that such a room would be
impossible to build in the real world.  The fibers in the carpet would
have to be exact so it would wear the same way.  The walls would have to
be internally identical so that they would dent the same way.  The table
must be purely homogenous so that if broken, it would break perfectly
symmetrically.  Their clothes would have to be so identical that they
wrinkled in the exact same way.  Air currents in the room would have to
be exactly symmetrical so their hair would become mussed in the exact
same way.  A piece of glass would have to be so perfectly symmetrical,
that it would shatter in a symmetrical pattern when broken.  The table
legs would have to be so symmetrical, that if broken off and spun like a
top, they could not fall in any random direction, but would have to stay
standing perfectly balanced in the middle of the room forever.

Richard Feynman suggested that a positron is an electron traveling
backward in time. If this is so, the Universe may well be a few
quarks traveling back and forth in space and time.

I noticed it immediately. It was, of course, a setup for the later
shot of the skydome. Fake astronomy being a minor sin in this context
of course.

What I do know is that with other people, if their brains are damaged or
altered in some way, this changes their behaviour which appears to me as
an alteration of their consciousness. Ergo, consciousness is attached in
some significant way to their brains. This is also consistent with my
own experience, albeit less drastically. Reading Oliver Sacks book
"The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat" is also very consistent with
this.

There's an excellent article in the current Sky and Telescope which has
the mass/lifetime/temperature curves for black holes.

I don't if I'm pleased that you understand, or
infuriated by the fact that I've been saying the
exact same thing all this time!

And then attempted to ask some questions to
determine why you thought they would diverge when
I had clearly stated they experience exactly the
same thing (many times), to which I got:

No, I am claiming their location is relative to
other walls (and objects) in the room. For
instance, the left-hand wall is 10 feet from the
right-hand wall, and so on.

> If you are not claiming this, why are you asking
> me to prove that they are different?

Because that is what this entire debate is about,
can you prove the walls are different? Can you
even know the walls are different? You point to
the left-hand wall and your copy does the same,
you see your copy pointing to the right-hand wall
and your copy sees the same.

> Do you not agree that they are different, or are
> merely exercising my proof system to see how I
> define location?

I'm simply trying to find out where you think the
copies will diverge. If they point to the
left-hand wall and see their copy point right and
think, "he's pointing to the wrong wall" there's
still no divergence. This I think, you now
understand.

So if we've established that they will not diverge
in thought, deed, or experience, can they act as
redundancy?

Even though you say you'd agree to being uploaded
"atom by atom" (I'm not quite sure how this would
work in the context of uploading) once you're
on-line it's likely you'll be prone to the usual
computer techniques of back-ups, redundancy and
time-sharing.

Well, I'm sure everything wouldn't have to be identical down to the atomic 
level, our senses are not that acute. In fact our senses, poor as they are,  
still send more information to the brain than it can process, a smart brain 
knows what information it can safely ignore and what it should pay close 
attention to. I don't think anybody really knows just how similar things 
would have to be before divergence happens.

Anyway it's just a thought experiment, and if you couldn't make identical 
real rooms it would be easy to make identical virtual rooms.

No you haven't.  You said that the walls were the same, when you really
meant that they look similar to the two participants.  You waid that
nobody could prove the walls different, when you really meant that the
two participants in the example would be prevented access to the tools
to do so.  You said that consciousness does not reside in the brain,
when what you really meant is that it doesn't have to remain in the
brain.  You said that consciousness does not reside in any location,
when what you really meant is that consciousness is not limited to a
single location.  Every time someone proved you wrong, you clarified
your position to be different from what you originally wrote.

Read my statement more carefully.  Your response is a non sequitur.

I fully support this theory.  It simplifies a lot of particle
interactions to realize that a positron is an electron coming backward
in time.  It explains why we see fragments suddenly appear out of
nowhere and then converge to form a positron.  Now, we realize it is a
positron coming back through time that collides with something and
breaks up.  We are seeing the fragmentation sequence in reverse.

It also explains some weird interactions where two particles appear out
of nothing and then disappear, existing just long enough to make some
interaction work.  Now we realize that the particle going forward in
time collided with something, got bounced back in time for a few
seconds, and then bounced forward through time again.  For the overlap
period, we see "extra" particles where the same particle exists in
different locations at the same time.

added a few questions that have arose from others (who I credit on the page
complete with e-mail links).  I am sending this to both the List and you for
more efficient delivery.  If you would like to make comments on my responses

Where is the list of potential FAQ questions? I didn't save the

I currently am thinking that short sound-bite answers are best. I also
think that addressing mystical questions with mystical answers is better

I've said they can see the same thing, I've asked
you to prove (always in the context of this
thought experiment) that they are different, but
not once have I said they are the same.

This entire thread was concerning a confined
thought experiment, not once did I apply any of my
questions or answer to anything other than the
situation in the room. It was you, not me, who
decided to post messages stating I had made grand
claims about two identical things being one.

I think this is something John may have said, I
have not said this.

John has said this, that consciousness is like a
number, or red, and has no location. I agree, but
I have not said as such during this debate.

If someone had proved me wrong, I would have been
the first to say so. What I have done is attack
the same experiment from different angles to try
to explain it, rather than just answer a
succession one-sided of questions.

The statement from you was on exactly the same
subject that you had previously said you now
understood in your reply to John. Since you were
agreeing that in this situation they would not
diverge I asked the next question hoping that you
might have some consistency of thought.

I think I may have confused you by quoting from
several different messages.

Even though the evidence implicating infectious agents in heart disease remains
circumstantial it continues to accumulate in favor of the hypothesis that certain bacteria and
viruses may play a causative role in the formation of artery clogging plaques. Since this link
was first reported further experiments worth mentioning have been conducted. These
experiments strengthen the association of Chlamydia pneumoniae (which is primarily known
as a sexually transmitted disease) and cytomegalovirus (a common virus that causes
respiratory infections) with atherosclerosis.

The initial experiments, as previously mentioned, involved the detection of antibodies in heart
attack patients or bacterial proteins in arterial plaques. More recently animal studies have
yielded more direct evidence that Chlamydia infection measurably thickens arterial walls
particularly in animals with a genetic predisposition to high blood cholesterol or animals that
were fed a high fat diet. In the same study it was shown that when the rabbits were given an
antibiotic that is used to treat Chlamydia infections the arteries more closely resembled those
of uninfected animals.

An additional microbial contributor to heart disease may be the same bacterium that causes
gum disease. This was determined from the dental data of 1200 men and it was found that
those with dental infections had a higher risk of heart disease and strokes. Another small scale
study may lead to the implication of the bacteria that causes ulcers (Helicobacter pylori) in
heart disease. However one cautionary note is raised in interpreting this data is that the
people with these infections tend to have higher risk factors for both infection and heart
disease such as smoking, living in poverty, being older and therefore it is difficult to sort out
correlation from causation. Further research must be done to determine the mechanism by
which these infections may cause arterial plaques. It may be found that these are merely
opportunistic infections that take advantage of the weakened health of someone with heart
disease.

The clinical evidence in humans is inconclusive so far. However some ambitious studies are
currently be undertaken and the results should be available within a few years. If antibiotic
therapies prove to be successful in treating heart disease then this powerful new paradigm of
chronic diseases being caused by infectious agents may be applied to other diseases of old
age with some exciting results. We have learned in the twentieth century how to fight
infectious diseases and it seems less daunting to be fighting a microscopic enemy than what
was assumed to be the "natural" progression into old age.

Towards long life!

As you might imagine this is not the first time the question of identity has 
come up on the Extropian list, a while back I told the list in three posts 
about an adventure I had in that regard. Despite all the trouble it caused me 
the first time I figure this might be a good time to tell my story again.

============================================================================                     
                        
It all started when I posted a message on the Internet, I knew it wasn't a 
prudent thing to do but I needed some advice and it's not the sort of thing I  
could write to Ann Landers about. You see, About a year ago I started 
building a matter duplicating machine. It could find the position and 
velocity of every atom in a human being to the limit imposed by Heisenberg's 
law. It then used that information to construct a copy, and it does it all in 
a fraction of a second and without harming the original in any way. 
You may be surprised that I was able to build such a complicated machine, 
but you wouldn't be if you knew how good I am with my hands. The birdhouse I
made is simply lovely and I have all the latest tools from Sears.

I was a little nervous but I decided to test the machine by duplicating  
myself. The day before yesterday I walked into the chamber, it filled with  
smoke (damn those radio shack transformers) there was a flash of light, and 
then 3 feet to my left was a man who looked exactly like me. It was at that 
instant that the full realization of the terrible thing I had done hit me. 
I yelled "This is monstrous, there can only be one of me", my double yelled 
exactly the same thing. I thought he was trying to mock me, so I reached for 
my 44 magnum that I always carry with me (I wonder why people think I'm 
strange)  and pointed it at him. I noted with alarm that my double also had 
found a gun and he was pointed it at me. I shouted "you don't have the guts 
to pull the trigger, but I do". Again he mimicked my words and did so in 
perfect synchronization, this made me even more angry. I pulled the trigger, 
he did too, my gun went off, his gun jammed, I buried him in my back yard.

Now that my anger has cooled and I can think more clearly I've had some pangs  
of conscious about killing a living creature, but that's not what really  
torments me. How do I know I'm not  the copy? I feel exactly  the same as  
before, but would a copy feel different? Actually there is a way to be  
certain, I have a video tape of the entire experiment. My memory is that the  
copy first appeared 3 feet to my LEFT, if the tape shows the original walking  
into the chamber and the copy materializing 3 feet to his RIGHT, then I would  
know that I am the copy. 

I'm afraid to look at the tape, should I be? If I found out I was the copy   
what should I do? I suppose I should morn the death of John K Clark, but how   
can I, I'm not dead. If I am the copy would that mean that I have no real   
past and my life is meaningless? Is it important, or should I just burn the   
tape and forget all about it?              

=========================================


The day after I posted my little adventure with my duplicating machine the   
shit really hit the fan. My Private Protection Agency (PPA) the Acme  
Protection Agency found out about it, and I'd love to know which one of you  
guys squealed to them. Anyway, they were hounding me constantly, following me  
around and asking all sorts of embarrassing questions. I tried to explain to  
them that nobody really died because no consciousness was stopped or even  
interrupted, but they weren't impressed with my arguments. All they were  
interested in was that there was a dead body and it had John K Clark's DNA and  
John K Clark was one of their clients. I picked Acme originally because they  
were a honest, tough no nonsense  organization, but now I wished I had picked 
a PPA that had a more philosophical bent. The fact that Acme also had capital 
punishment didn't seem as appealing as it once did either. Acme was really 
starting to annoy me, but I don't suppose I'd be much better off back in the 
olden days when Nation states still existed and took  care of police work.

I knew that if I was going to do something I had to do it quickly. My lawyer  
told me I should expect to be arrested in the next few days. He said that my  
best bet was to plead self defense, but he didn't seem very optimistic, and 
even if I eventually won it would take years and every dime I had in legal 
bills. I had a better idea, it would solve things in one day and it would 
only cost half my money, but I would have to do something I'd been dreading 
first. I looked at the video tape, my worst fears were confirmed,  I am the 
copy, no doubt about it. This sort of threw me for a loop at first,  but I
gradually got used to the idea, and now realized that I feel just the same so 
it can't possibly make any difference.

I set up my video camera so it covered the entrance to the duplicating  
chamber but was careful to make sure that this time it couldn't see into the  
chamber itself. I turned on my duplicating machine and walked into the  
chamber, a few seconds later I walked out but there was somebody with me,  
somebody who looked just like me. I sent the tape to Acme and they dropped 
all charges against me. They had no choice, Acme may be tough but no PPA will  
prosecute someone if they know there is a 50% probability they are innocent.  
They have no way of knowing which one of us killed the original John K Clark   
even we don't know that. 

Well, this solved one problem but it created another one, the double. 
I've tried to be broad minded about it, really I have, but the man is just  
obnoxious.  Mr. Know-it-all is always droning on and on about the stupidest  
things, and he thinks he's SO smart, personally I think he's a moron. 
Just as I feared he says he deserves at least half of my money, but I'm the 
one who made it not him, I remember how I earned every dollar. I don't like 
the way he looks at my girlfriend either.

This entire experience has made me a wiser man. I now understand the value of  
subtlety, putting a bullet in the brain of the original John Clark was stupid.  
I also understand that the world is a dangerous place and that dreadful  
accidents happen every day.  How very sad. 

I'm looking at the jerk right now and he has an insufferable grin on his face.  
I don't know why he's looking so smug but that's OK,  let him grin while he  
can, it won't last long. I know exactly how to deal with him, and to think,  
people used to say that I understood machines but not people. I'll soon prove
them wrong.

It looks like he's also writing a post but I can't quite make out from here  
what he's saying, probably just a bunch of pretentious nonsense, I'll read it  
when I come back, right now I've got to drive into town to get some supplies.  
I'll be mighty happy when summer comes, I do so hate driving on these icy 
mountain roads.                                   

=========================================


I had decided that the only way to get Acme Protection Agency off my back 
was to make a duplicate of myself, that way they couldn't tell which one 
killed the original John K Clark so they couldn't prosecute either one of us.  
I walked into the chamber expecting to see my double materialize next to me,  
but nothing happened. Terrified that the machine was malfunctioning I ran to
the control panel, one of these days I've got to figure out a way to build a  
matter duplicating machine without using 89 pounds of enriched plutonium.  
To my surprise I could not find anything wrong with the machine, then I  
noticed I wasn't alone. A large tough looking man was staring at me. 

"What the hell! How did you get in here?" I yelled at him. 

"Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to offend, ah, are you John K Clark" He 
stammered.

For a tough looking guy he was sure acting like a wimp. I never could   
intimidate big gorillas like this guy, but I guess those assertiveness  
training  tapes I bought on the home shopping network were paying off after 
all.

"Yea I'm Clark and who the hell are you"  I said in the tough man voice the  
tapes had taught me. 

Then I noticed it was dark outside, 5 minutes before when I walked into the  
chamber it was about noon. 

" What's going on?" I said, not sounding quite so tough.

" Oh I'm sorry, my name is Spade, Sam Spade, I'm a private investigator,  
I work for Acme, but don't worry I'm not here to arrest you or anything.  
Ten and a half days have passed since you walked into that chamber, and there 
is nothing wrong with your machine, it's sort of hard to explain but the fact 
is, I used the machine's maintenance logs to reconstruct you 5 minutes ago, 
just as you were the last time you used the machine, 10 and a half days ago."

For some, finding out they were a copy of a copy would be big news, but for  
me it was getting to be old hat. What was amazing was that some gum shoe had  
done it, and from the maintenance log! The information on the state of the  
machine and thus on every object I had ever duplicated is in those computer 
logs, but the format of the logs would make it difficult to extract because 
that's not what they were made for. I never used them for anything except  
troubleshooting the machine.

"My congratulations Mr. Spade" I said " it's not every private eye that has a   
 good enough working knowledge of Schrodinger's Wave Equation, quantum  
 coherence and non linear error correcting codes to read those logs correctly".

"Yeah well... I got an A in shop class when I was a kid" He said with a touch  
of pride.

"Oh, well that explains it." I said " But what's been going on for the last  
 10 days?" 

"The copy of John K Clark did duplicate himself," Spade said " but apparently  
 the two versions didn't get along". 

"My third wife always said I was a hard man to live with" I said a little  
sheepishly.

"Both Clarks are dead, and they died at almost exactly the same time,  it 
could be accidental, but the deaths are a little suspicious, especially when 
you consider two almost identical posts made to the to the Internet by them 
that are somewhat incriminating. One Clark was found in his car at the  
bottom of a thousand foot cliff. The roads were icy, but the brake lines 
didn't look quite right to me. The other Clark was found crushed under a  
Coke machine. The consensus is that  he put in his 50 cents and when it  
didn't give him his Coke he started beating on it until the machine tipped  
over on him and fractured his skull. Well maybe, but that machine was heavy,  
I tried, I could not tip it over and I'm bigger than he was. I think they 
killed each other, they were similar enough to want to kill each other but 
diverged enough in 10 days to chose different methods".

"Now you can't blame that on me" I said indignity, " I know nothing about it,  
 I didn't even exist then, well not exactly..."

"Nobody's blaming you" Spade said soothingly " and you are still one of our  
clients, so when I mentioned the maintenance logs in my report my boss said  
we were legally bound to make a good faith effort to revive you, so he told  
me to give it a try and do my best."

He brought out a document from his coat " I am also authorized to offer you  
this deal, Acme agrees not to prosecute you in any manner for this incident   
and to seal the case file, there are those who might find it, ah, titillating.  
In return, you absolve Acme of any liability in this matter and agree to 
resign from The Acme Protection agency within 5 working days. The unused  
portion of your premium will of course be refunded.

Now you can't beat that deal with a stick, I signed the paper before they  
could change their mind. 

"I want to thank you Mr. Spade for bringing me back." I said " Can I offer 
you a drink?"                                      
                     
He was already heading for his car at a trot "Thanks but no" He said " I've  
got this, this important thing I've got to do, It's ah, a thing of importance,  
I've got to, ah, wash the lawn, I mean mow the dog, I mean... good-bye".  

I'm afraid our Mr.Spade is a bit of an oddball, I seem to run across more  
and more people like him lately.     

As I stood there amid the smell of burning rubber a disturbing thought 
occurred to me, it was a pretty tricky job to get all the information about  
me just from the maintenance logs, was I really OK, had Spade gotten  
everything right? I've always been good at mental arithmetic so I gave myself  
a test, 5 and 8 is 13, 19 minus 6 is 12, 8 times 9 is 73. Right on the money!  
That was reassuring. 

I must be John K Clark, I have all of his memories, I remembered the happy day  
in my childhood when I joined the Vladimer Lenin fan club and received an  
autographed 8 by 10 glossy of the master that has hung in a place of honor  
in my bedroom until it disappeared that very day. Spade must of stolen it.   
I remembered my triumphant election as the head of SHIT (Stop Heretical  
Independent Thoughts) and how I had always hated Science. The memory of the  
time I played Twister in The Kremlin with Marilyn Monroe, J Edgar Hoover and  
the Dalai Lama while the Pope serenaded us with a lovely rendition of  
Louie Louie, is as sharp in my mind as the day it happened.

Clearly there was nothing wrong with my mind, but what about my body?  
I looked at myself in a mirror and I don't want to brag or anything but I  
looked great! My skin was a nice healthy blue, the scales on my tail were  
strong and sharper than ever. I smiled, what women wouldn't fall for that  
infectious grin and the handsome green slime that oozed out between my fangs  
and fell artistically to the floor.          

                               THE END

[Update] [Next article]  
Technology: The ultimate in miniaturized circuits
Henry Gee 
It may soom be possible to manufacture electrical contacts so tiny
that they comprise just one, single atom, creating the ultimate in
electronic miniaturization. In a report in the 9 July 1998 issue of
Nature, Elke Scheer of the Universität Karlsruhe and her
multinational, European research team describe how they used single
atoms of four different metals as key elements in electronic circuits.


It wasn't so long ago that computers occupied entire rooms: now we
wear them as wristwatches. Once upon a time, simple switching devices
required heavy, large, expensive vacuum tubes. Then came the
solid-state transistor. Today, transistors are measurable in microns –
thousandths of a millimetre across. 

But researchers are seeking to cut this scale another thousandfold, to
create electronic components on the scale of atoms and molecules.
Already, a single carbon 'nanotube' has been made to work as a
transistor, and a molecule of buckminsterfullerene (C60) has been
turned into an amplifier. "With a whole new class of electronic
devices based on single atoms or molecules entirely within our
technological reach," writes Lydia L. Sohn of Princeton University in
an accompanying editorial, "it is an exciting time for physics,
engineering, material science, chemistry, and even molecular biology."


Scheer and colleagues created their single-atom contacts using a
device called a scanning tunneling microscope, or STM. This is a
device that uses an extremely fine probe to scan the electronic
properties of a surface. The 'microscope' part comes from the fact
that differences in voltage across the probe's tip as the machine
scans a surface can be converted into images of surfaces down to
atomic resolution. (The surface of carbon graphite, for example, looks
like the pressed cardboard used to make egg boxes). 

To make an electrical contact comprising one single lead atom, a lead
STM tip was indented repeatedly into a lead surface and finally
withdrawn, stretching the contact as if it were cheese fondue. The
conductance was measured as the contact was stretched. Rather than
falling gradually as the lead was stretched (because the same current
had to squeeze through an ever-smaller cross-section of metal), the
conductance fell in discrete steps: this is one of those slightly
eerie quantum effects that begin to predominate at very small scales.
Just before the lead was stretched to breaking point, it formed a wire
just one atom across, whose electrical conductance properties could be
measured. 

Furthermore, the number of steps that the conductance fell before the
wire finally broke depends on a simple relationship that depends on
the way that electrons are disposed around the nucleus of the atom
concerned. The electronic 'structure' of an atoms determines the
number of routes that an electric current can burrow its way around,
under, through and over an atom – and, therefore, its conductance.
It's no coincidence that the chemistry of elements varies in a
predictable way according to the same variations in electronic
structure (such is the basis of the Periodic Table). 

The researchers determined this intriguing, fundamental property of
atoms by testing single-atom contacts made from elements of widely
differeing chemical behaviours, including aluminium, niobium and gold.
The 'break junctions' used to test the conductance properties of
aluminium and gold were initially constructed by lithography. In
principle, then, it should be possible to create circuit-boards with
single-atom constrictions. 

But perhaps most interesting of all, these single-atom contacts
determine the conductance of the entire circuit in which they are
placed: in other words, the quantum properties of atoms effectively
determine the properties of an electronic circuit, which is an
everyday, 'macroscopic' object.

My apologies. If anyone can tell me how to make Eudora Pro put the actual
poster's
name on the attribution line when I reply to the Exi List I would be
grateful. It's
a drag to cut and paste, cut and paste,,,,,,,,etc.

It's the old "Reply" vs. "Reply-to-All" problem in another form.  At
least for my Eudora Pro (on a Macintosh), if I "Reply-to-All", it
automatically puts the attribution line because it knows I'm talking to
multiple recipients.  If I "Reply", it assumes that I'm only replying to
a single person called "extropians" and doesn't put any attribution.  My
MacSOUP program has the same problem.  You might try "Forwarding" the
message to extropians.  I think this quotes everything and puts an
attribution, but then you have to manually address it to extropians
because it doesn't know where you are going to "Forward" it to.

I guess there's no way for the programs to tell that
"extropians@extropy.com" is a mailing list and not a single person?  It
seems like the programs should realize that the "Reply-to" header which
we are replying to is different than the "From" header, so it should
attribute the quote.

Well, the world is discrete as well. Even if it wasn't you still could 
approximate it arbitrarily close, where you couldn't tell artefacts due
to finite resolution of the model.

Whether they are chemical, or physical, it's ok as long they are magickal.

Very easily, that's called molecular modelling. In fact you would
probably have to reach down as deep as ab initio, to validate the
higher-order models in overlapping strides. Some people have already
coupled MD with QM for realistic enzyme models.

Scientists this week decoded the first confirmed alien transmission 
from outer space. Here is the text of the message that they decoded:

"This really works!  

Just send 5*10^50 atoms of hydrogen to each of the five star systems
listed below.  Then, add your own system to the top of the list, delete
the system at the bottom, and send out copies of this message to 100
other solar systems.

If you follow these instructions, within 0.25 of a galactic rotation you are
guaranteed to receive enough hydrogen in return to power your 
civilization until entropy reaches its maximum!"

Please, do.  Thin skins don't last very long around here.  I don't take
any objections personally.  As long as you don't call me stupid, feel
free to call my ideas stupid.

Very good question!  I was being very sloppy in my wording, and poorly
expressing my belief that someday we will be able to duplicate
everything the brain does.

I stand corrected that neurons cannot duplicate brain function.  Between
the neurons are neurotransmitter chemicals which carry messages.
Besides duplicating neurons, we would also have to simulate a chemical
communications network between neurons and learn to encode and decode
the chemical messages.  We also have to simulate the competition of
neurochemicals for receptor sites, and simulate the rate of transmission
success and loss, including thresholds.

This is much more complicated than my flippant remark about replacing
neurons would really indicate.  We either have to simulate chemical
reactions so that the neurons can interpret the results, or we have to
crack the coding of these chemical messages so that the meanings of the
messages themselves can be simulated.

You are right that the wet chemicals also have to be simulated, and not
just the neurons.  The neurons might be data flags, but we still need
software and messaging systems to access these data states.  There also
are different thresholds for neurons firing, based on various chemical
levels.  Neurons are not binary, either on or off.  We may even have to
simulate limited chemical availability, just like in the real human
brain.  If we make the simulated chemicals unlimited, would this
overload the software or have a jamming effect as every neuron fires
continuously?

You are totally correct that replacing every neuron is simplistic.  We
do have to duplicate the wetware, either with chemicals or full
simulations.

Well, the world is discrete as well. Even if it wasn't you still could 
approximate it arbitrarily close, where you couldn't tell artefacts due
to finite resolution of the model.

Whether they are chemical, or physical, it's ok as long they are magickal.

Very easily, that's called molecular modelling. In fact you would
probably have to reach down as deep as ab initio, to validate the
higher-order models in overlapping strides. Some people have already
coupled MD with QM for realistic enzyme models.

Death). Vienna: Verlag  Orac, 1987. ISBN 3-7015-0081-9" is now online (see
http://members.aol.com/klausrei/buch.htm ). This book contains much about
cryonics, uploading, space colonization and other transhuman themes in German

German and Austrian newspapers and TV because of my book and because of my
cryonics arrangements with Alcor.

Regarding any one development, one might wish people were more 
or less clueless.  But people's fear that people who bring them
news of changes are being selective based on such considerations
can be poisonous.  I'd rather try to earn people's trust by 
developing a reputation for just being as honest and forthright
as I can be about what changes I forsee.

I interpreted both of your initial statements as rejecting inquiry into 
things post-singularity.  It seems as if you both think we *can't* 
possibly know anything, so we shouldn't try.  Then in response to my
queries for clarification, you ask me to show you prediction textbooks 
with formulas derived from first principles.  

0) I submit my paper http://hanson.berkeley.edu/filluniv.pdf, as giving
   mathematical predictions derived from first principles regarding 
   an important aspect of post-singularity behavior. 
1) Humans have a vast amount of knowledge and insight, only the tiniest 
   fraction of which can be expressed as equations derived from first 
   principles.  It's a big mistake to say we know nothing about a subject
   if no such equations are presented.
2) Even if we knew nothing about a subject, that wouldn't mean
   we couldn't learn something if we put our minds to it.  You need a 
   much stronger argument to reject inquiry other than we don't know 
   anything now.
3) Human insight isn't indexed much by year of applicability.  The best
   experts in banking now know things relevant for forecasting post
   singularity banking.  People who understand art well know things 
   relevant for forecasting post-singularity art.  Just becasuse there
   isn't a book called "Post-singularity banking and art" Doesn't mean 
   people don't know things relevant for this.
4) For a subject a broad as "post-singularity", insight just isn't very
   discrete, since there is so much relevant knowledge.  We know more
   about the year 2098 now than we did in 1898, and likely will know
   more ten years from now.  Our insight improves incrementally, so 
   there is no cliff beyond which we know *nothing*.  I see no
   "horizons," analogous to where the curve of the Earth makes human 
   visual resolution suddenly fall to uselessness.

It seems to me that the motivations of future entities can be predicted
as a combination of
1) Selection effects.  What motivations would tend to be selected for 
   in a given situation?
2) Legacy motivations.  Descendants of current creatures will likely
   retain much of their motivations, translated to a new context.

Wanting to die isn't favored by selection or legacy, except for certain
translation possibilities.   Spatial colonization will be selected for,
and has lots of legacy pushing for it as well.  

Increases in intelligence allow creatures to anticipate selection effects,
accelerating their effects of creatures who prefer to be selected.
Increases in intelligence also raise the possibilities of creatures 
attempting to integrate their otherwise disparate legacy preferences 
under simpler unifying principles.  Otherwise, I don't see how increases
in intelligence should lead us to expect much change in motivations.

Unless a neuron has a soul it can be simulated. One neuron sees another  
neuron as a black box, it doesn't matter how it does what it does as long as 
it gets the job done.

I don't see the slightest reason why norepinephrine or any other 
neurotransmitter would be especially difficult to simulate, because chemical  
messengers are not a sign of sophisticated design on nature's part, rather 
it's an example of Evolution's bungling. If you need to inhibit a nearby  
neuron there are better ways of sending that signal then launching a GABA 
molecule like a message in a bottle thrown into the sea and waiting ages for  
it to diffuse to it's random target.
  
I'm not interested in chemicals only the information they contain, I want the  
information to get transmitted from cell to cell by best method and few would  
send smoke signals if they had a fiber optic cable. The information content 
in each molecular message must be tiny, just a few bits because only about 60 
neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA are known,  
even if the true number is 100 times greater (or a million times for that 
matter) the information content of each signal must be minute. Also, for the 
long range stuff, exactly which neuron receives the signal can not be 
specified because it relies on a random process, diffusion. The fact that 
it's slow as molasses  in February does not add to
its charm.                                         
   
If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small and  
your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the correct  
continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work done, then you  
don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason why simulating that 
anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty. Artificial neurons could  
be made to release neurotransmitters as inefficiently as natural ones if  
anybody really wanted to, but it would be pointless when there are much  
faster ways.
  
Electronics is inherently fast because its electrical signals are sent by 
fast light electrons. The brain also uses some electrical signals, but it 
doesn't use electrons, it uses ions to send signals, the most important are 
chlorine and potassium. A chlorine ion is 65 thousand times as heavy as an 
electron, a potassium ion is even heavier, if you want to talk about gap
junctions, the ions they use are millions of times more massive than 
electrons. There is no way to get around it, according to the fundamental laws 
of physics, something that has a large mass will be slow, very, very, slow. 

The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the ability 
of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various strengths with 
other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the fundamental laws of 
physics that prevents nano machines from doing the same thing, or better and 
MUCH faster.

I would even say that some of his conclusions are justified. There is a
tendense that the "intellectual challenged" will fall thru the social
security net.

With the current trend that the new jobs that are being created is for the
intelligencia only, there is a great risk that a large part of the
population will be without meaningfull work to do.

Especially with all the automation taking over the jobs of the middle class
and thus forcing them to take jobs that traditionally has belonged to the
lower social groups.

Thanks for all the answer-suggestions that have been posted. I'm 
collecting the tidbits. Now we turn to:


TRANSHUMANISM AS A PHILOSOPHICAL AND CULTURAL VIEWPOINT

What are transhumanism's philosophical and cultural antecedents, and
how is it distinguished from other, similar ideas?

Me: The FAQ discussion is also taking place on the transhuman list, 
and I posted something there today that is relevant to this question. 
I paste it at the end of this messege. The other suggested answers 
below are ones that Henri Kluytmans posted earlier:

What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?

Is transhumanism a cult/religion?

-It is definitely not a cult. Although it is not a religion it 
seems to fill the same niche in our mind as religion does.

Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because 
they can't preserve or create the soul?

-Experiments and accidents (electro-stimulation, drugs, damage,
surgery) show that almost all aspects of the human "spirit" (i.e.
mind) can be linked to physical locations or physical processes in the
brain. This leads to the strong assumption that the "spirit" is
completely stored only in the physical matter of the brain. 

-Almost all neuro-biologists agree that the complex behavior displayed
by the network of connections between the neurons is sufficient to
explain the emergence of the human mind. 

Is there transhumanist art?

Make cat food out of unproductive pensioners? ;-) It's good and well
that transhumanism is iconoclastic, but that's not really all we are
about. Many people are doing that (especially teenagers). We're also
trying to develop a constuctive alternative. But many
non-transhumanists think they are doing that too.

What sets us apart, I think, is our view that technology will 
dramatically transform things in the not-too-distant future and that
it is basically a very good idea to apply science and technology to
overcome human mental and physical limits - to become posthuman. That
is what I take to be the essense of transhumanism.

Transhumanists are also, on the whole, humanists, which is a more
inclusive concept (just as extropians are transhumanists). As
humanists, we believe that humans should be allowed to develop their
full human capacities and that we should apply rational methods to
improve the human condition rather than expecting that some deity will
do the job for us. From humanism we also inherit, I think, the idea
that divisions based on race, nationality, religion etc. are secondary
and that primarily we are humans and should strive to cooperate
internationally for peace and prosperity. Tolerance, freedom of
thought and speech, human rights, believing in the importance of both
art and science, and the ideal of "one world" are other core humanist
values that transhumanists share.

So I think if you look at how secular humanists define their 
philosophy you will find that "improving the human condition with
rational means" does not really capture what sets us apart, what makes
us distinct from non-transhumanist secular humanists. Even though it
might on some occasions be a useful rethorical ploy to define our
position as a truism, I think it is better if we are upright in
describing what we are.

(Also, if we are hoping to be taken seriously by academics, you can't
hope to get away with "improving the human condition with rational
means"! You'd be laughed to pieces by any philosopher, for example, or
more likely you'd just be ignored.)

 They have the same kind of causal connection that my current consciousness
has with the consciousness of the person (me?) who went to sleep in my bed
last night, for those of us who consider consciousness to be information
processing. You can probably come up with a different concept of consciousness
for which these causal connections aren't equivalent (involving continuity of
some aspect of consciousness), but I have yet to hear a clear version of
this that is consistent with most people's concept of identity.

 I don't think I understand your will to live, but my will to live
consists of wanting my memories, behavior patterns, and similar observable
quantities to exist in the future. Can you clarify what features you
value in the biological Harvey Newstrom that will exist 24 hours from now
that might be missing from a copy, without using subjective classifcations
such as "it's me" or "it's perceptions are my perceptions"?

 Do you mean anything by the word "transfer" here? I think that if you
could translate this last sentence into something that is potentially
falsifiable, we might be able to make some progress. But given your
current formulation, I'm unable to tell whether you want something
unverifiable (did your soul or vital force get transferred?) or whether
scientific analysis can potentially answer your concerns.

 How about imagining a process that disassembles X% of the atoms in
your brain and puts them back where they were a microsecond later.
Is the resulting person you or is it someone else?
 Does the value of X matter? Does it matter if some of the atoms are
replaced by equivalent atoms from somewhere else?

 I am confident that someday objections to uploading will seem as silly
as the fear that cameras steal people's souls, but I'm worried that
prejudice against the first uploads will cause serious problems, and I
suspect people like Harvey are worried about whether they will miss out
on some important advantages to being one of the early uploads.
 Predictions about maturing upload societies seem less urgent than
debates that may affect the rights of the first uploads.

Probably...I confuse easily....

For example.

  Several years ago a sniper killed a young woman from ambush at ruby ridge
Idaho.

  Severl months ago sniper killed  a young woman from ambush at Jonesboro
Arkansas .

Which incident was force...which was violence?

There MUST be a difference...since the judicial disposition of the two killers
is quiet different.

Transhumanism is humanism without the limits imposed by a narrow
definition of "human."  Why must a humans die?  Why must humans feel
pain? Why must a human be made of flesh?  These are the questions that
transhumanists ask each other and themselves every day, and the questions
that humanists gave up on millenia ago.

> What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?

Epicurus, Hume, Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, FM-2030, Max More
(these are my associations, they may not be representative)

Transhumanism describes-- it describes a general covergence of values
among like-minded individuals. It describes a unrelenting desire to live
and a defiant disregard for the present limits of the human race.
  
Religions dictate-- they dictate rules, morales, and values.  They 
dictates how to live and how to die.
 
> Won't things like uploading, cryonics and AI fail because 
> they can't preserve or create the soul?

(in addition to the already stated empirical evidence approach, I have
provided an answer for those who prefers semantics and "logic" to
empiricism...)

For a spirit to interact with matter&energy, it would by definition have
to BE a form of matter&energy.  If it is useful(or spiritually imperative) 
to separate matter&energy into that which is considered the "soul" and
that which is not, this separation can be accommodated in the uploading
process.  

Thus, by simple logic, it is appparent that even those who believe in a
soul can be uploaded without compromising their faith.  Transhumanism is
therefore compatible with any religion that does not explicity state "Thou
shalt not upload!"    

> Is there transhumanist art?
> 
> [Natasha, open the floodgates!] 

[E. Shaun Russell might also have some comments..]

My answer:  Yes.  To the transhumanist, living is the highest form of
artistic expression.  Without the constraints of standarized morales and
pontifficated "ethics," the transhumanist is free to execute his
daily activites entirely for their artistic value.  There are no regrets
that an action has defied a higher purpose; transhuman art justifies
itself, since the artist is accountable only to himself.(/herself/itself)

Geoff.

There are reasons for prejudice, and there are excuses for prejudice.
Whether an upload is "the same person" as a human seems more an excuse.
The reasons would more depend on concerns about uploads taking away 
human jobs, beating humans on the battlefield, being insensitive to 
an ecological collapse, etc.  I'd rather address reasons than excuses 
at this stage of the game.

No, you are presuming a viewpoint that I don't have.  I have no
requirement to remain conscious, as long as I don't stay unconscious
forever.

I make no such claim.  The copies are identical.  Any feature that one
has, the other has as well.  I have no doubt that both copies are
equally "me" or equally the same by any scientific measurement.  I
merely claim that they are not the same individual.  If you let them,
they will both go out and lead two similar but different productive
lives.

A transfer move a single object from one location to another.  A copy
leave the original object in the original location, but creates an
identical object in a new location.  I am distinguishing between an
upload procedure that results in one copy, and a duplication procedure
that results in two copies.

> But given your

You quoted my first paragraph where I rejected the claim that
consciousness would "jump from the original to the copy when the
original is destroyed" because "I see no scientific basis for this."  I
have always insisted on scientific analysis and reject claims that are
not falsifiable.

No problems here.  Even if the atoms are grossly out of position, but
the macro structure of cells are still replicated, I have no problem.  I
think you are trying to address viewpoints that I do not hold.

I think you are assuming, like others have, that my position is that
they copy is not "me" because it is somehow different.  This has never
been my position.  It is a misunderstanding, probably due to my own
inability to explain myself.  The original is "me".  The copy is "me".
They are identical and both are equally "me".

My only objection has been the killing of the original.  This is not
based on any fault in the copy.  It is because I want the original to
continue to live.  I believe "Harvey Newstrom" is a viable person
capable of great things in the future.  If you duplicate "Harvey
Newstrom", there are now two "Harvey Newstroms".  I think both of them
can be great.  Left alone, they will both grow, experience and evolve.
Killing one of them because he is "no longer required" or "not
sufficiently unique to contribute anything new", is murder just as it
would be to kill any person for these kinds of reasons.  I think
duplicated people have the same rights as any person.

This is what I mean when I say they are not the same person.  Left to
their own volition, they will go off experience different lives and act
independently.  I don't want either one of them killed.  If the intent
is not to duplicate people, then I suggest we find a way to move
consciousness without duplicating it.  Once we create independent and
viable beings, I don't think we should go back and kill them.

I enjoyed your well-written and well-reasoned paper, but it starts from a
bunch of reasonable but unsupported assumptions about the structure and
motivations of the SI. The principal assumptions are that the SI wants to
expand and that the SI is not singular. As a simple hypothetical counter,
assume that your conclusions are found to follow from your assumptions even
afer careful scrutiny by an SI. Then it's possible that the SI can infer
from introspection that all SIs will be motivated to merge instead of
competing.

"First principles" may be too strong a requirement, but weakening it
is dangerous. In the past, humans' vast amount of knowledge and insight
has lead to consensus belief systems such as christianity, communism,
and freudian psychology.

Indeed, humans can construct enormous intricate philosophical structures.
There is a very large body of such work relating to the nature of
heaven.

Off-hand, I'd guess that banking is irrelevant to a singular SI. It's not
clear that it's relevant to a plural SI. Art as understood by chimpanzees
is IMO qualitatively different than art as understood by humans. There is
no reason to assume that SI art will be comprehensible to humans, or that
it is like human art in any way.

I assert that the only relevant thing we know that was not known in
1898 is that a singularity has a high probability of occurance before
2098.

OOPS, I lost myself, also. I meant to say:
   Human motivation is the same as the motivations of ants?
I intended this to mean that I think that human motivations are a lot more
complicated than the motivation of ants, and that the motivations of an
SI will be proportionately more complex.

I don't see this. Selection appplies to populations, and requires
replication and mutation. It may be that there is a population of
SIs. I don't think so, but I could be wrong. However, its irrelevant, since
only one SI is important to us: the one generated in our singularity.

This whole line of reasoning neglects the fact that the SI has control of
its own motivations. The SI may choose to (i.e., be motivated to) retain
legacy motivations, but this is by no means certain, or even likely.
By my own rules, I can assign no probability to it either way :-)

ExI hasn't done as much this year as I'd like to see, but it's certainly
done more than that. If we could afford a marketing director, you certainly
wouldn't get the job. :-)

* A whole bunch of new material was added to Extropy Online around the
beginning of the year.

* New reviews have been added recently.

* Derek has made a number of changes to the web site.

* More articles have been worked on for EO, and they are in process. Sasha
can tell you more about that. For instance, there is a major Singularity
feature under construction with numerous writers.

* The newsletter came out in March, and the next (overdue) issue will be
out within a week.

* The NodeNet idea has gone through a number of revisions as we figure out
what we can realistically do with our severely limited resources. We've
finally simplified it to the point where it's ready to launch. Two initial
NodeNet forums are being set up as I type. Subscriptions to the Investing
in the Future and the Legal Issues of the Future forums will be accepted
within days. More forums will soon follow.

* Some groundwork has been done to plan the EXTRO 4 conference. A focus has
been identified, potential speakers listed and some contacted, and various
other details thought out.

* We have set up a new members-only email list, the Extropians-Select list.

* Various local meetings have taken place in several places in the US.

* Extropy Institute has responded to a number of media inquiries, leading
to the publication of our ideas. (The UK's .net magazine even printed The
Extropian Principles as part of a positive article.)

* A booksigning was held for Jim Halperin's First Immortal.

* A new group, focusing on technology investing was formed and has met
several times.

* Plans have been made to move ExI office admin to a full-time office where
it can be taken care of more quickly. This is happening, and will be
completed in two weeks.

As I said, we'd all like to do much more. We are more limited than ever by
having NOT ONE paid staff member -- not even someone to work on projects
part time. Everything is done by volunteers when they have time.

In the year ahead, I look forward to making our fourth conference a
reality, and making it the biggest, best, and most informative and
influential ever. I look forward to the development of the NodeNet and,
under the new hand of Sasha Chislenko, I look forward to the expansion of
material on Extropy Online. As volunteer energy allows, I also hope to see
considerable development of the web site.

I've put up a quick and dirty set of web pages for NodeNet, so that there
is a permanent and current reference place. I'll leave it to Derek to
pretty them up and integrate them into the web site. The main NodeNet
information page is at:


http://www.extropy.org/nodenet/nodenet.htm

This has hyperlinks to information on the initial two NodeNet forums.

NOTE: Those of you who have volunteered to be NodeMaster for one of the
proposed forums, I haven't forgotten you. Once these two initial forums are
up, and the procedure is in place, I'll be in touch and we'll be able to
get several more forums up quickly. I'm still open to volunteers, before
making final decisions about who is to be NodeMaster for each forum.

Onward!

Thanks, Danny. I think it would be a good thing to have links to relevant
documents on each NodeNet forum's web page. However, what those links
should be will be up to the NodeMaster for each forum. Certainly I would
encourage you to make suggestions to each NodeMaster as web pages go up for
each topic forum.

I would hope that the NodeNet web pages will not only include links to
other sites, carefully chosen, but also to documents produced by
Participants in each forum.

In fact I even think the assumptions we can do useful future synoptics over 
decades of dramatic growth are _dangerous_, since presenting a mirage
of "I can engineer my future strategies sensibly". Otoh, I can
incorporate the shrinking window of predictability into my strategy
planning just fine (not too much good this will do to me also, I fear).

Thanks. Web connectivity is still crippled, but I'll try to access it. For
the future, please consider presenting your papers also in
nonproprietary, canonical Internet publishing format: gzipped (and 
soon bzipped?) PostScript. http://xxx.lanl.gov has set de facto standards.

I think this is a dangerous position. You can't communicate intuitive
insights, verbalizations are unwieldy to prepare and even more to 
consume. A graph or a table of numbers are much more succinct, and 
less prone to misinterpretation. I'm notoriously wary of number
toters, and those who believe (analytical) mathematics is perfectly 
applicable to the real world (usually it isn't). Yet, I think much 
could be gained if there was a common communicable 
calculus/formalization. Perhaps an augmenting reality device 
(current model: wearable with a HUD/Twiddler/myopotential input) could be 
instrumental here, since requiring to be able to project graphical 
stuff upon semiintuitive cue.

The bulk of past predictions now seems ludicrous. A tiny minority was
more or less accurate, yet the contemporaries had not the benefits of
ours: backsight. They couldn't tell shit from shinola, nor can we now.

If there is no banking nor art after the Singularity, extrapolating
from past human insight is worth shit. If anything, a biologist
specializing in food network ecology, or an ALife researcher would be
the ones to listen to. However, point is even their forecasts are
totally unreliable.

My interpretation of the Singularity is that you do not see nothing
unusual if you traverse it as an observer (provided, personae persist
during the process), things just grow a lot more hectic, as does the 
rat race. However, you emerge a god from the other side (orelse the
Singularity has not occured, and even relatively conservative
predictions are perfectly applicable), which is perfectly
incomprehensible for an nonparticipating mehum observer. This all 
assuming there is a thing as a Singularity, of course.

This argument will not appeal to its stated audience, I think, because
most of those who believe in the soul would not swallow your premise that
a soul is matter or energy; many believe it is made out of soulstuff that
cannot be measured; others believe that it is energy, but it is a form of
energy which is unlike other forms of energy in certain mystical ways.
Anyone who believes these things will not be convinced by your argument.

To answer this question more mystically:

Some people believe that if humans were ever to build a brain or reanimate
a cryonically frozen one, it could never have a soul.  If this belief is
true, then artifical consciousness of any kind is impossible. 

I must begin by pointing out that it seems quite likely that humans will
one day create something so sophisticated that we will not be able to tell
whether it is conscious or not simply by observing its behavior.  For
example, a functional upload would definitely APPEAR conscious. Similarly,
if we could get cryonics to work at all then the reanimated person would
look and act just like a normal person; while progress in AI is moving
slowly for now, I am aware of no strong evidence that it is impossible to
make a computer which ACTS like it has a soul. That we will one day, at
least, perfectly imitate consciousness seems clear to me. 

The necessary consequence of this point, however, is that when presented
with such a computer, we could never use human observation to figure out
whether it has a soul or not.  If it acts conscious, claims to be
conscious, and exhibits intelligence, there's really nothing further we
can observe using our five senses.  The rest is necessarily incorporeal.

I could now argue, as many intelligent people have, that if we cannot tell
the difference between something that has a soul and something that
doesn't, then it doesn't really matter; some have even gone as far as to
define consciousness in terms of its behavior, claiming that anything that
seems conscious, is. 

This answer does not settle well with the religious, however.  A religious
person might argue that there are lots of things outside of human
observation; the soul may be one of them.  While a behavioralist might not
find this argument very compelling, the behavioralist's argument is
equally opaque to the religious: just because we can never observe whether
the soul is there or not doesn't mean that it is there; nor does it mean
that we cannot know at all. 

I conclude, then, that if one believes that the answer to this question
cannot be acquired by human observation, then the religious have no choice
but to seek out *religious* knowledge, ie that wisdom derived from
religious texts and personal meditation.

Unfortunately, this specific question is not explicitly answered in any
religious text that I am aware of.  Like so many other things, the
religious must work out the answer to this question themselves, with only
their wits and their religious knowledge to guide them.

That being said, here are some interesting questions to ask yourself:  
Does the soul enter the body during the conception process?  If so, would
it likewise form in a body in which one cell was actually a computer?
What about two cells?  Four?  A dozen?  Half?  Most?  All but one?  All?

Similarly, many people alive today were frozen, as fertilized zygotes,
months before a woman gave birth to them.  Do they have a soul?  Would
they have a soul if they were frozen three months into the pregnancy? 
Six?  Immediately following birth? 

Good luck!  :)

Bizarre.  So, we have a soul, yet it has no measurable effect on the body?
Hmmm, I don't know too many religious type that believe that; however,
arguing against a belief such as that would be futile since you are truly
arguing against nothing.  Only Occam's Razor can defeat nothing, and not
too many religious types can be swayed by this method.

You're absolutely right.  I didn't clarify my audience well enough.  I
don't think mystics can be swayed by logic: any logical conflict can be
resolved by "god works in mysterious ways" or "such are the mysteries of
the universe."  My audience is the religious who still bow to logic: the
scientists and philosophers who have to deal with the conflicts between
their faith and their way of life everyday.  

Mystics require a different approach.  My theory is that mystics are
hedonists and aesthetes in disguise.  Convince them that shedding their
mystical ways will give them great pleasure and fulfillment, and you've
got them.  This can be challenging when you're dealing with someone who
has built the perfect mustical world for himself/herself.  How can one
compete with fantasy?  Maybe some really good VR.

Then they also believe that a person who has had a near-death experience
has no soul.  *Everyone* I know who believes in an afterlife gives
credence to NDE stories.  I highly doubt any of them think that the post
NDE'ers have lost their soul since they were clinically dead for a
while.  I also doubt I could find anyone who claimed they knew the window
of time where one could reanimate a body and no longer have a soul
present.  Building a brain is a different story...

These questions will not phase a mystic.  The soul enters the ovum at
conception.  The soul eventually connects to the brain, half the neurons
automated = half the living area for the soul to connect to the body.
Frozens cells have dormant souls.  These answers come easy to someone who
doesn't care about logical conflicts or empirical evidence.

If spiritual satisfaction is the only goal of a mystic, then transhumanist
must provide this to sway him.  Words won't cut it, but really good drugs
and Virtual Reality might.

This claim is independent of any concept of singularity.  So are you

How can you be so sure of these things, that gods have no banking, and 
that gods are incomprehensible to us?  These true by definition of "god"?

I don't assume our descendants want to expand, only that a some parts of 
them do expand, with some variance in strategies.   

I'm not at all sure what you mean by a "singular" SI, and as I've said 
I suspect this is the key to our differing perspectives.  Perhaps you 
could elaborate.

"qualitatively different" does not imply "incomprehensible".

Again, I'm puzzled by your image of a future of a grand "singular"
entity with no replication or mutation in any parts.  Does it use
any form of modularity to deal with complexity?

This isn't new. Cultural evolution has been part of human history for 
millenia, and cultures have a lot of control over their motivations.  
DNA makes young people be impressionable, absorbing values from the 
culture the find themselves in.  Cultures can choose to teach new things 
to their young if they want to.  But selection has had a big effect on 
which cultures we now see.

It's an attractive analogy that a posthuman will be to a human as a
human is to an insect.  This suggests that any attempt to analyze or
understand the behavior of post-singularity intelligence is as hopeless
as it would be for an insect to understand human society.  Since insects
clearly have essentially no understanding of humans, it would follow by
analogy that we can have no understanding of posthumans.

On reflection, though, it seems that it may be an oversimplification
to say that insects have no understanding of humans.  The issue is
complicated by the fact that insects probably have no "understanding"
at all, as we use the term.  They may not even be conscious, and may be
better thought of as nature's robots, of a similar level of complexity as
our own industrial machines.  Since insects do not have understanding,
the analogy to humans does not work very well.  If we want to say that
our facility for understanding will not carry over into the posthuman
era, we need to be able to say that insect's facility for <something>
would not work when applied to humans.

What we need to do is to translate the notion of "understanding" into
something that insects can do.  That makes the analogy more precise and
improves the quality of the conclusions it suggests.

It seems to me that while insects do not have "understanding" as we do,
they do nevertheless have a relatively detailed model of the world which
they interact with.  Even if they are robots, programmed by evolution and
driven by unthinking instinct, still their programming embodies a model
of the world.  A butterfly makes its way to flowers, avoides predators,
knows when it is hungry or needs to rest.  These decisions may be made
unconsciously like a robot, but they do represent a true model of itself
and of the world.

What we should ask, then, is whether insect's model of the world can
be successfully used to predict the behavior of humans, in the terms
captured by the model itself.  Humans are part of the world that insects
must deal with.  Are they able to successfully model human behavior at
the level they are able to model other aspects of the world, so that
they can thrive alongside humanity?

Obviously insects do not predict many aspects of human behavior.  Still,
in terms of the level of detail that they attempt to capture, I'd say
they are reasonably effective.  Butterflies avoid large animals, including
humans.  Some percentage of human-butterfly interactions would involve
attempts by the humans to capture the butterflies, and so the butterflies'
avoidance instinct represents a success of their model.  Similarly for
many other insects for whom the extent of their model of humans is as
"possible threat, to be avoided".

Other insects have historically thrived in close association with humans,
such as lice, fleas, ants, roaches, etc.  Again, without attempting to
predict the full richness of human behavior, their models are successful
in expressing those aspects which they care about, so that they have been
able to survive, often to the detriment of the human race.

If we look at the analogy in this way, it suggests that we may expect
to be able to understand some aspects of posthuman behavior, without
coming anywhere close to truly understanding and appreciating the full
power of their thoughts.  Their mental life may be far beyond anything we
can imagine, but we could still expect to draw some simple conclusions
about how they will behave, things which are at the level which we can
understand.  Perhaps Robin's reasoning based on fundamental principles
of selection and evolution would fall into this category.

We may be as ants to the post singularity intelligences, but even so,
we may be able to successfully predict some aspects of their behavior,
just as ants are able to do with humans.

Actually, an associate of Feynman had this thought, that there may only be
just one particle in the entire universe moving backward and forward in
time, but they could not work it out, and it only would work in a closed
universe, which now seems not very likely. Additionally, since any quantum
event involves a particle emitting both a virtual photon and anti-photon
(only one of which becomes 'real' when accepted by another particle, which
emits its advance wave that travels in the opposite direction), then since
the big bang involved a large amount of anti matter going backwards in time
while matter went forward in time, we can see that it is likely that the
universe is open in both directions, and cosmic background radiation that
exceeds that accounted for in our own side of the big bang can be accounted
for as virtual photons emitted by the antimatter side (that aren't accepted
by other anti-matter in that side) of the universe moving toward our
temporal 'side' of  the universe and being accepted by particles in our side
of the universe.

Yes, Feynman's version of QED not only simplifies a lot of particle
interactions, but it also explains others that neither the particle or wave
theories of QED by Schroedinger and Dirac could, as well as being useful in
completely explaining all of classical physics in a quantum mechanical
manner. I just read the Gribbins' biography of R. Feynman last night. Its a
good read.

It also explains action at a distance, which many die hard classicists point
to as an example of the folly of quantum theory. essentially you have two
particles, both of which emit their virtual signals both forward and
backward in time. The one moving forward in time is called the 'emitter' and
the one going back in time is the 'acceptor'. The phase of the signals
overlapping constructively creates a real photon, while if they are out of
phase they cancel out on either temporal side of the exchange.

Prof. John Cramer of the U. of Washington found that since the particle
further back temporally experiences the acceptor signal at the same instant
that it emits its own signal, then causality is eliminated and the
Schroedingers Cat paradox is eliminated. There is no 'cloud of probability'
that must be observed.

I have tried to make a comprehensive listing of the FAQs so far discussed on
the Transhuman Digest and Extropian Digest so far at:
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/Webfaqs1.htm .  I realize
that to single click reply and comment on a web site page is not so easy so
I've pasted the hopefully comprehensive list below.  I've tried to credit
all sources that were quoted with e-mail links to facilitate discussion.
Please send comments to both lists (if you subscribe) and to mailto:
health2u@biogate.com i.e. "Reply to All" on MS Outlook.

FAQs ? Frequently Asked Questions about Transhumanism:
------------------------------------------------------
Most of the questions listed below (except the first one) were posed and
articulated by Nick Bostrom of the London School of Economics.  If you have
any additional questions you would like to suggest, please e-mail them to
me.  Contributions of responses are noted parenthetically after the
responses.  An FTT denotes a response from this web site.

How does Transhumanism relate to Futurism?
Transhumanism is a vision of the future based on many reasonable forecasts
of current trends.  Many futurists, such as my self, tend to adopt a
Transhumanist perspective and philosophy as they study the possible,
probable and desirable alternative futures of humanity.  Transhumanism is a
position within Futurism. (FTT)

What is Transhumanism?
Transhumanism is a type of humanism related to secular humanism.  It is a
philosophy of science which seeks to enhance the human (Homo sapiens)
condition by biological and technological enhancements into a post-human
(Homo excelsior) status.  Using genetic, cybernetic and
psychopharmacological  approaches, we can speciate into something better.
(FTT)

Transhumanists are also, on the whole, humanists. As humanists, we believe
that humans should be allowed to develop their full human capacities and
that we should apply rational methods to improve the human condition rather
than expecting that some deity will do the job for us. From humanism we also
inherit, I think, the idea that divisions based on race, nationality,
religion etc. are secondary and that primarily we are humans and should
strive to cooperate internationally for peace and prosperity. Tolerance,
freedom of thought and speech, human rights, believing in the importance of
both art and science, and the ideal of "one world" are other core humanist
values that Transhumanists share. (Nick Bostrom)
The accelerating pace of technological development and scientific
understanding of the human animal is creating the possibility of a whole new
stage in the history of the human race.  In the very near future we will
face the prospect of such technologies as real artificial intelligence, new
kinds of cognitive tools that combine artificial intelligence with new
interface technology, powerful new molecular biological engineering and
non-biological molecular nanotechnology.  The consequences of these
developments will include the prospect of meaningful augmentation of the
human being in fundamental ways.  Realistic possibilities flowing from these
developments include significant increases in human mental and physical
power and vastly extended life spans.  They also include the possibility of
great harm to human life as we know it.  Even though these are extreme
possibilities, they are taken seriously by an increasing number of
scientists and scientifically literate philosophers and social thinkers.
(Greg Burch)

What is a post-human?
A post-human is the species that comes after humans much like we came after
chimpanzees.  The difference is that our successors in evolution will be
intelligently designed by ourselves, the Transhumans.  This new process,
presently underway in its initial steps, is often called participant
evolution or co-evolution. (FTT)
Post-humans could be completely synthetic or they could be the result of
extending a biological human's capacities with many partial augmentations.
In either case, a post-human would be a "higher" life-form than humans, in
the same sense as a human could be said to be higher than an ape. More
specifically, this means that a post-human may have a greatly expanded
intellect and memory; an indefinite life-span; the ability to choose its own
mental states and emotions. Also exosomatic ("outside-the-body")
improvements count, such as rapid access to databases or networks containing
huge landscapes of ideas and information; high-bandwidth communication links
with other post-humans (almost like a computing network); and advanced
manufacturing technologies for building physical structures.
Most Transhumanists think it is impossible to fully imagine what post-humans
would do or what it would be like be a post-human -- just as non-human
primates cannot begin to fathom the complexity of human affairs.

Why do you want to live longer?
I love life and I see life itself as intrinsically meaningful.  In short,
the meaning of life is life itself.  Additionally, humans are far too
myopic, shortsighted.  With the dramatically increased control we humans
have over nature greater foresight is needed as we plan out future.  Only
those with a personal investment in the long range future of the species and
the planet can effectively oversee its resource management.   Thirdly,
bigger and better accomplishments that humans can only recently
realistically achieve will require the long term talents of great minds.
Such plans as domed Moon cities, aquanautic cities at the bottom of the
Ocean, terraforming Mars and possibly Venus, floating L5 cities, the genomic
sequencing of all major organisms, the astrocartography of the known
Universe, the final mapping of subatomic structure and a final grand unified
theory of physics,  propulsion systems development for interplanetary and
interstellar travel all will require dedication that will span centuries.
Only people with such a prospect and such long-term energy and commitment
will be able and necessarily motivated to accomplish such goals. (FTT)

Isn't death part of the natural order of things?
Humans are part of nature broadly defined.  It is our nature to modify our
environment for our better survival and prosperity.  All animals try to so
modify their environment by storing food, building nests, burrowing holes or
simply grassing food, etc.  Earthquakes, tornadoes, disease, predation,
starvation and death are all natural.  Nature is not essentially good or bad
but is morally neutral.  Human reason must decide what is good and what is
bad based on their survival and prosperity needs. (FTT)

Won't extended life spans cause overpopulation problems?
Human populations will continue to grow regardless.  What longer lifetimes
will allow for is the longer-term projects such as the populating of new
lands (nova terra) for the expansion of human (and post-human) populations
(FTT)

Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? What happens to
the rest?
Innovations always benefits the entire society in which they arrive.
Whether it is cars, radio, TV, computers, refrigerators, microwave ovens,
the telephone or whatever only in the beginning are these "toys" or
"luxuries" available to the affluent.  Over an increasingly shorter amount
of time, mass production techniques, increased demand and more efficient
manufacturing techniques to meet the higher demand increase supply.
According to the basic Law of Supply and Demand in economics, the higher
supply lowers prices as is shown very well in the computer industry.  A
capitalist economy is essential for the competition necessary to most
efficiently supply the demand.  History demonstrates this continually as in
the examples given above. (FTT)

What kind of society would post-humans live in?
Post-humans will likely live in a technologically advanced, democratic,
capitalistic society where personal freedoms are respected.  In short a
society similar to that in the industrialized, information-based societies
typical of the United States, Europe, Japan and many other such countries
around the world. (FTT)

Are Transhumanist technologies environmentally sound?
Transhumanist technologies have the potential to preserve existing
ecosystems. Reasonable non-Transhuman extrapolations of existing human
culture have little chance of reserving the current ecosystem. (Dan
Clemmensen)

Isn't Transhumanism tampering with nature?
"Tampering with nature" either means modifying our environment which is
natural for us and all other animals as stated earlier.  As far as
self-modification, this process has been going on since medical men and
women have tried to heal sick people.  The disease of aging may be natural
but so is our evolutionary instinct to counter it in favor of our own
survival. (FTT)

Transhumanists reject a bright line between "man" and "nature": From its
beginnings, the development of our species has been a process of positive
feedback with our technology, broadly defined as those created tools we use
that are not part of our simple genetically endowed physical structure or
behavioral repertoire. From the time of the simplest stone tools and most
primitive linguistic constructs, humanity has been engaged in extending its
capacities through the use of increasingly powerful "artificial" tools.
Thus, "tampering with nature" is the very thing that makes us human.
Transhumanists simply seek to continue that process -- wisely -- onto a new
level of sophistication. (Greg Burch)

Won't Transhuman technologies make us inhuman?
Transhuman technologies in environmental and self modification will improve
our condition so that we may become something better.  We as humans (Homo
sapiens) will become post-humans (Homo excelsior?) much as Homo habilis and
Homo erectus before us. (FTT)

Do you believe in God?
Beliefs in anything should be based on evidence.  As a metaphysical
assumption, conventional monotheism is beyond evidence and cannot be proven
or disproved. Such a deity is supposed to exist prior to and be creator of
the Universe and thus is outside of the Universe.  As such nothing in the
Universe can provide evidence for that which exists outside of it.  Since
the existence of such a monotheistic deity is unknowable even in principle
an agnostic position is more reasonable  than either a theistic or atheistic
position.  Efforts at the improving and transforming of the human condition
based on factual evaluation of evidence will be far more fruitful than empty
debate about this historically contentious and often culturally-bound
metaphysical question. (FTT)

So you think technology will solve all problems?
Science and the technologies can  solve material questions only based on the
study of physics, chemistry, biology and related natural sciences.  Cultural
problems of misunderstandings among ethnic/subcultural groups within a
society or the intercultural disputes between societies can be remedied or
improved by empathy and the social sciences. (FTT)

Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the condition of
the poor people or solving international conflicts instead of putting effort
into foreseeing the "far" future?
The natural sciences can best address the longer-range problems of the human
condition.  The social sciences can help address the other problems combined
with the direct efforts of relief agencies which should continue.  In short
both endeavors are very important for humanity's future in the short and
long term. (FTT)

What evidence is there that it will happen?
Many trends and successes suggest that continued genetic and cybernetic
enhancements are possible.  The artificial heart, bionic or artificial
limbs, organ transplantation between humans and the initial successes in
trans-species xenotransplantation suggest both the technological and
biological approaches are working.  Gene therapy successes are very direct
evidence that increased genetic enhancement of humans will also continue
especially through the recently invented human artificial chromosome (HAC)
which can safely deliver corrected or beneficial genes to every cell of the
body. (FTT)

There is a non-physical soul and therefore some Transhumanist issues are
bound to fail (uploading, conscious, AI).
Studies of neural damage in neurosurgery wards throughout the world suggest
that all functions of the human "spirit" or mind are localized within the
brain.  Even the general mental activities of the mind have been mapped to
very specific regions of the brain's neuroanatomy.  Neurophysiologists have
shown that thought and memory are electrochemical in nature and have
detailed much about exactly how this happens.  Though the brain is extremely
complex, given enough time in terms of many decades or at lest centuries,
enough knowledge is likely to accumulate to allow for the successful
transfer of biological awareness to a similar noncarbon substrate such as
silicon and the self-awareness of advanced parallel processing computers as
well.  Eventually though Artificially Intelligent (AI) computers may be some
of us or our descendant post-humans. (FTT)

What is nanotechnology?
Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular
level.  In the future molecular manufacturing by self replicating robots
making houses, space ships, etc. is often cited as the goal of
nanotechnology.  Current research  in nanotechnology though seems to focus
on applications of it  in quantum supercomputing  with microscopic CPUs,
memory chips and possibly microscopic nanomachines to make cellular repairs
in medicine. Such things as the Gene Chip from Affymetrix and the Bucky
Balls (C60) are often considered current discoveries credited to
nanotechnological studies. (FTT)

What is the Singularity?
The Singularity is a concept borrowed from astrophysics and applied to
participant evolution.  The Singularity is  when our current concepts and
definitions of "life", "consciousness", "intelligence", etc. which we apply
to our selves and our surroundings will no longer be valid.  For example, a
conscientious computer as in Artificial Intelligence (AI) would make our
standard definition of consciousness, intelligence and life difficult to
explain.  Especially if this aware computer can copy itself (as we do
software today) and thus replicate and even modify its own programs then
this is replication and "genetic" variation and thus Artificial Life (AL).
Similarly, as we augment out own intelligence with psychopharmaceuticals,
neurotrophic factors etc. we will likely have an experience of awareness and
intelligence and even of life that is difficult and probably impossible to
predict or even describe.  As in the Event Horizon at the edge of a Black
Hole, what we know breaks down.  A Black Hole is caused by a Singularity and
thus dramatic changes from a human to a post-human will be analogous to such
a Singularity. (FTT)

These new technologies will be used in war and may cause our extinction.
That such nanotechnologies are and will continue to be developed is a given.
That we need to monitor and direct that development to avoid malevolent uses
of technology should be equally compelling. (FTT)

How will superintelligent machines treat us humans?
We expect that such machines will behave in the same rational, ethical
manner that their inventors/creators do. (FTT)

All these Transhumanist issues will not happen within a hundred years. They
will take more like a thousand years. (MNT <molecular nanotechnology>,
Uploading)
The time-scales of developments in science and technology are getting
shorter not longer.  Though the exact chronology of future events is not
known, the forecasting, monitoring and directing of those events to reach
the soonest and best possible outcome is the primary emphasis in
Transhumanism. (FTT)

What if it doesn't work?
Transhumanist trends are already working as examples above illustrate. (FTT)
Is Transhumanism a cult/religion?

Transhumanism is a philosophy of science NOT a religion.  "Cults" (as
defined by sociologists) are religious sects that show blind obedience to a
single authority and eschew connections with the outside world .  Religion
and philosophy take different routes to satisfy the drive for meaning in
life.  Transhumanist philosophy (as any complete philosophy) can replace the
need for religion in one's life. (FTT)

What makes Transhumanism different from other philosophies, movements or
religions?
Transhumanism weds theory with action, the abstract with the concrete.  As a
philosophy of science it is both speculative as philosophy and
self-correcting as science.  Unlike previous philosophies and religions in
human history, it has a very concrete and realistic yet bold, ideal and
futuristic vision for the next stage in human biological evolution on Earth
in our solar system today and tomorrow. (FTT)

Isn't Transhumanism old hat? Sure, it's a new name, but basically, hasn't
the philosophy been around a long time?
Transhumanist longings and yearnings for a better existence and to improve
upon what he or she finds in life are as old as the human condition.  The
concrete and detailed goals and plans of where to go and how to get there
are rather new in human history.  Accordingly, the name Transhumanism has
only recently arrived in the English language.  It might not yet have even
made it into the Oxford English Dictionary but at lest will in time. (FTT)

What prominent thinkers are associated with Transhumanism? (This is not the
same as "Who is prominent within Transhumanism?")
John Brockman who founded the Edge Foundation and the Reality Club and
authored The Third Culture is associated with Transhumanism.   Many if not
all of the people in his anthology also are. Several books such as Last
Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era and Create/Recreate also give insight into
this.  Certainly K. Eric Drexler inventor of the idea of nanotechnology and
founde of the Foresight Institute is also.  The list is very long and  will
be added to as time passes. (FTT)

Oh well... (Person sort of agrees in an intellectual way but doesn't take it
to heart)
The transition to a Transhumanist way of seeing the world is sometimes slow.
I recommend reading a Transhumanist book and joining either the
Transhumanist or Extropy mailing list to get better acquainted with the
theory and practice of Transhumanism as a way of life and living. (FTT)

How could I become a post-human?
Participation in Transhumanist activities is the best way to become
post-human.  Possible actions include: joining Transhumanist mailing lists,
reading related books, joining and participating in societies such as the
World Transhumanist Association and the Extropy Institute, attending annual
meetings of such societies such as TransVision and EXTRO.
Because the circumstances of life are unpredictable, to increase the
likelihood that you become a post-human I also suggest the following:
Changing your life insurance policy to include coverage or at least $100,000
(which is standard), the beneficiary of the policy to a cryonics company
such as Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute, CryoCare or
Trans Time, signing up for such a service to make the "anatomical donation"
of your self available to them, setting up a trust fund possibly for your
re-entry and letting any  family and/or  friends that you trust know of your
intentions. (FTT)

The possibility of success (in cryonics) is too small.
The chances are constantly improving as cryobiologists continue their
research as efforts such as the Prometheus Project promote the application
of such research to mainstream clinical application of cryonics procedures
and techniques.  Certainly, the healthier you stay and the longer you live
the better your chances become. However, those chances in participation in
post-humanity are vastly greater than zero.  Zero chances results when you
simply give up, die and decompose. (FTT)

Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?
Your family, friends and descendants will be interested in reviving you.
Others who might know you through stories carried down from your family and
friends will also.  Keeping a diary/log book or a video history of your
self, your life and that of your friends would act as an external time
capsule or archive of your extend memory over time.  Genealogical research
may also give you and your descendants a greater sense of connectedness to
you.  Not only will these things increase their interest in reviving you,
they will give you more friends once you do re-enter the sentient state.
(FTT)

What recent progress has been made towards Transhumanist goals?
Many advances in cloning, body transplantation, organ generation, gene
therapy, cryobiology, neuroscience, neurosurgical imaging, nanoscale
computing,  etc. show trends in the Transhumanist direction. (FTT)

What kinds or Transhumanist transformations might occur? How can these be
understood in relation to our current species?  (What is a possible
taxonomic structure?)
[Note: much of the context of this question and its response came from Doug
Bailey and Alan Grimes. The exact wording is from FTT.]
Our current species Homo sapiens is likely to be transformed first
genetically by gene therapy (as has occurred a few times in
clinical/experimental trials).  As long as such creatures can procreate and
interbreed with humans, the central criterion of speciation, these creatures
remain Homo sapiens although they may qualify as a subspecies Homo sapiens
excelsior.  Once human artificial chromosomes (HAC) are used to introduce
entire suites of genetic programming the likely effect is to make
interbreeding difficult or impossible.  At this point according to taxonomic
rules, the organism is a new species, Homo excelsior.  Cybernetic
enhancements, if they do not interface directly with the organism in a
essential way could be Homo cyberneticus.  Those that incorporate Silicon
chips into their brain as coprocessors or encyclopedic memory chips would be
Homo biocyberneticus.  Because both genetic (excelsior) and cybernetic
(cyberneticus) improvements can co-exist, a taxonomic classification
priority system would need to be implemented to distinguish between species
and subspecies.  Since taxonomy is done by biologists not cyberneticists
excelsior would likely be given prior species status if both occurred in the
same organism e.g. Homo excelsior biocyberneticus.  As far as the genetic
enhancement of other species, it seems that the same classification system
would apply first sapiens to denote sentience then excelsior to denote
genetic improvements and then cyberneticus or biocyberneticus if such
implements were added.  The genus would remain the same.  If massively
parallel supercomputers are deemed intelligent and sentient they would
constitute a separate genus, Cyberus, and possibly a new kingdom Silica and
phylum, class and order as well.  Again Cyberus sapiens would be the
starting point.  After that, the speciation epithets become more murky
because of the limits of the Singularity.  It seems that a completely
uploaded humanoid creature (of the genus Homo) that had an entirely
nonorganic body would belong to the new genus Cyberus.

Existence is a nonlinear complex adaptive system of autocatalytic processes
in astrophysical, genetic and memetic evolution. (ref. J Doyne Farmer, Third
Culture)

I'm an idiot...  HERE's the best argument against AI critics:

AI's goal is not to create an artificial soul, but to create artificial
*intelligence*, which is a very different concept.  Intelligence can be
defined purely in terms of behavior: the ability to problem-solve, respond
to stimuli and/or coordinate its efforts with other intelligent beings. 
If the AI project builds a computer that can do these things, then it will
have succeeded; *appearing* to act intelligently should not depend on the
soul, unless it is somehow necessary for problem-solving.  Arguably, the
best test for AI is the Turing test: does it behave so much like a person
that another person is fooled?

There is a great deal of evidence that intelligent behavior CAN be
exhibited by artificial constructs; that we will create a device which
will respond to stimuli so convincingly that we will have no way to tell
the difference between the robot's behavior and a person's behavior.  Even
if this construction does not have a soul, it WILL be intelligent; if so,
AI will have worked.

Good point about cryonics and NDEs; between that and the point about
frozen zygotes I think we've answered the question for AIs and cryonics.

As for uploading...  see that rather copious thread in its numerous
incarnations over the years.  IMO, we've yet to answer that question well
enough to satisfy *ourselves*, (sorry to those on both sides who think
the other side is obviously wrong! :p) so I should hardly think that we'll
be able to answer it well in a short FAQ answer.

"It's an attractive analogy that a posthuman will be to a human as a
human is to an insect.  This suggests that any attempt to analyze or
understand the behavior of post-singularity intelligence is as hopeless as
it would be for an insect to understand human society.  Since insects
clearly have essentially no understanding of humans, it would follow by
analogy that we can have no understanding of posthumans. ....."

I've always thought that a superior analogy would be between humanity
and "chimpanity" - chimpanzee's have relatively complex social
behaviours, have a simple sense of self, have a primitive ability for
communication, and have a simple number sense. However, humanity
has developed all these abilities far beyond the capabilities of any
chimpanzee.  By analogy, it then seems probable that transhumans (and
note that I'm not talking about SI here) will retain these abilities, though
developed to a more complex level.

Caged chimpanzees can, to a certain extent, predict the behaviour of
humans within their small sphere of influence (ie. within their cage), but
can not even begin to fathom the deeper concepts that drive their
keepers.

A nice analysis Hal.  

What seems more disturbing about the human ant analogy is that humans have
little use for ants, usually killing them off when feasible, exactly 
because of limited expressiveness of ant models.   If we could tell ants
"If you pick up the dust within this chalked area, we'll give you this 
cup of syrup," we'd love ants, and their future would be assured for a 
long time to come.  It's not that ants couldn't do this, but more that
they don't have an interface that let's us ask them to do it.

Pieces of software code are usually much dummer than ants, but their
future seems brighter because they have relatively general interfaces. 
They can sit in libraries, and much smarter creatures can put them to use
as desired, flexibly connecting them to other code chunks.  We can know
what they do and tell them to do it when desired.  They rarely have 
problems understanding what we tell them, because we don't bother to tell
them anything we don't think they can understand.

It seems to me that human interfaces are flexible and general enough
that if transhumans find them useless, it wouldn't be because someone 
couldn't tell us what it is they wanted done that we could do.  It would
more likely be because we just couldn't do it, or couldn't do it as 
cheaply as some competitor.

As usual, my spelling is catching up with me. That should be
"preserving", not "reserving".

Also, I now see that I used too many big words in an attempt to
be concise. I'd like to improve this by adding a simple lead-in
as follows:

Maybe, but they are still our best hope. Transhumanist technologies
have the potential to preserve existing ecosystems. Reasonable
non-Transhuman extrapolations of existing human culture have little

It all depends on what you include in the upload simulation. Hormones alter
synaptic responses, growth rates, etc, etc. A good upload will include
what's know about the pertinent biochemistry.

Fer sure. It's Murphy's Law:

 Anything which CAN go wrong WILL go wrong.

(Note this doesn't mean *everything*. It is a design principle to ensure that
ONLY the intended configuration is possible and will work. Like putting
together Quonset Huts, making it impossible to do except in the intended
manner.)

I don't believe in the history of public health that snipers were used for
any purpose. It's a lot simpler to change the building code and tear down
and destroy sources of disease. And I don't find many snipers at my local
restaurants either.

Aha...but now we run into another problem.  If consciousness is an emergent
property of "wet" systems..in other words, if the way we "feel" (as opposed
to the mere computational aspects of our brain function) is dependent on the
chemical aspects of our brain, then a computational model will not capture
the "wetness" of our consciousness.  You can model the combustion of
hydrogen and oxygen on a computer, but it won't make a bang!  Now I'm not
entirely convinced that consciousness is "wet" but it seems to be a
possibility that is quite neglected in AI discussion.

John Clark added:

A nice leather-bound paperback and a floppy disk can both contain the exact
same information, but the first is qualitatively different from the second.
It is possible that the qualia of consciousness is dependent on its
"wetness".  You can simulate an explosion on a computer to an arbitrary
degree of accuracy, but it will never produce a shock wave.  Is
consciousness more of a shock wave than a data representation?  I'm not
sure, but its what I intuitively "feel". I can't think of a critical
experiment that can determine this, so it should be good for endless
philosophical debate...at least its not as boring as guns good/guns bad :)

way you can put a limit on a free man's value to you. Even a SINGLE
free man. You must be a philosophy PROFESSOR at Yale!

I don't think tools are extropian - people are.

You can do more damage and more good with a powerful computer than
with a gun. Technology is amoral. All technology can be used towards
extropian goals, or toward 'entropian' goals.

The choice is ours. 

Certainly, rejecting technology that the 'entropians' regularly misuse
(such as guns) will not help the 'extropians'. After first inventing
the technology, and letting it fall into the wrong hands, giving it up
completely into the hands of 'entropians' is probably the dumbest
thing an 'extropian' can do.

Besides the points in the rest of this post, the most important issue
here is that applied consistently, over the long term, a criminal
lifestyle increases the risk of being caught with every act. When you
are 'trying not to get caught' you are, as Rand pointed out, at war
with reality - which is a losing proposition. 

To 'get away' with a crime, you have to make the facts appear to be
other than what they are, and since reality is an integrated whole,
and all aspects of it inter-related, there is no way to sustain a
consistent misrepresentation of facts over the long term. Indeed, the
very idea is a contradiction in terms.

So you WILL be caught out in the long-term. And the reality-split
within your own mind will produce paranoia, guilt, and eventually,
severe psychosis, as you try to win your losing battle against
reality.

I speak not only from a theoretical viewpoint, but from
experience. Been there, done that. I used to be a kleptomaniac in my
teens, pulled off the most daring heists, but today there's just no
way I'd swipe the most trivial of items even when there's nobody
around to see - it has a way of catching up with you!

Hi,

I'm suprised no one in any of these fora have mentioned this yet.
Their webpage is located at:

http://java.sun.com/products/jini/

Basically, it appears to be a 48k upgrade to the java language
which permits widespread distributed computing. If it is real, it
may well turn out to be pretty huge.

Independent? Not quite. It's just that predicting things grows the
harder the nearer we are near the Singularity. _Of course_ one should
attempt to envision the future decades ahead, just don't expect it's
graven in stone you'll turn out right.

I can't be sure, that's the reason I mentioned this. The bandwidth of
possible developments suddenly explodes, and you're a sorely put at
assigning probabilities to each individual branch of the multitude.

As to 'gods are incomprehensible to us', why, yes, I'd say that's a
part of their definition. If I can predict the actions of a posthuman, 
then it is no different from a wind-up toy.

While I appreciate the effort you've gone to, I feel that from an 
organizational point of view, it would be much more productive if Nick 
remained the person co-ordinating the process of providing answers to 
the FAQs.  It minimizes communication difficulties, and duplication of 
effort.  This is especially true with respect to private 
email; recall that Nick's original request was that we email him 
comments; you have not been privy to the entire conversation.  Nick is 
the person best placed to continue co-ordination of the entire 
discussion.

I do think it would be great if your site could host a copy of the FAQ 
once it has been developed.

Cheers,

The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the
ability
of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various strengths with

other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the fundamental laws
of
physics that prevents nano machines from doing the same thing, or better
and
MUCH faster.

Nick Herbert
your[Orch OR] model needs to have many tubulins
coherently entangled so that ORCH OR can collapse the state in an act of

consciousness. Now in your model you SAY that this happens but you don't

actually calculate realistically how this will be achieved.

Stuart
We calculate that, for example, 2 x 10^10 tubulins in superposition for
25 msec will self-collapse. We calculate this from the indeterminacy
principle
E=h/T where E is the gravitational self-energy of the superpositioned
(separated from itself) mass, h is Plancks constant over 2pi, and T is
the
time till collapse. It happens because superposition, in the Penrose
view,
actually involves separations in underlying reality - spacetime geometry
at
the
Planck scale. The separations are unstable and after a while reduce,
something like a radioactive particle decays.

NICK: this number 2 x 10^10 is the number of coherent tubulins that YOU
NEED in order for ORCH OR to collapse the wavefunction. You cannot use
this
calculation to show that a coherent state of 2x10^10 bits MUST EXIST.

In a more familiar context your logic resembles a real estate broker
calculating that you need $40,000 to close a deal (collapse the wave)
and
you go home and tell your wife that the broker has given you $40,000.


Stuart
As I said earlier 2 x 10^10 entangled tubulins for 25 milliseconds
lifetime.
Im not sure what type of calculations you want, but Id very much like
to know.

NICK: What kind of calculation? That's up to you. Perhaps something like
a
2D array of interacting spins on an Ising lattice as is done for
ferromagnetism calculations with parameters adjusted to match tubulin
parameters. From this post i already see another big problem with
setting
up such a model. I had naively assumed your two tubulin states open (O)
and
closed (X) to have the same energy so that when you perform a
phase-coherent superposition of |O> and |X> you get a nice stationary
state
(no time dependence). But in your model |O> and |X> differ in energy by
as
much as one electron volt. This means that the superposition is not
stationary and will oscillate between the two states at a frequency of
about 10^15 HZ (f = deltaE/h). Because this frequency is so high it will
be
extremely difficult to maintain phase coherence with an adjacent tubulin

oscillating at the same (or slightly different) rate, let alone a whole
gang of 'em. A better strategy might be to superpose all the |O> states
and
all the |X> states separately to make two interpenetrating coherent
states
but as i say only a quantitative toy model calculation can show if
coherent
tubulin states can plausibly exist at all. Knowing the extreme
difficulty
of creating coherent states in the laboratory under the best of
conditions
i am pessimistic about the possibility of establishing coherence in a
hot
wet tubulin array.

Your (very imaginative) model rises or falls on the crucial question of
whether this particular kind of coherent state exists in the brain or
not.
My informed guess is that coherent states of even one or two tubulins
cannot exist for more than a nano-second or less. Seems to me that until

someone shows (quantitatively) that the existence of large coherent
tubulin
states is even remotely plausible that your whole proposal is physically

UNREALISTIC at a very basic level.

And of course if you can't cohere any more than one or two tubulins in a

single neuron the operation of gap junctions is wholly irrelevant.

        Meaning of mind in backaction theory - Jack Sarfatti

Phillip Benjamin has said that Bohm's hidden variable X is
the "mind" in the post-quantum backaction theory. That is
not the way I see it. The mind is the post-quantum potential
landscape Q* whose shape, at time t in the configuration
space for the material path X(t), depends directly on that
path. Recall that the shape of the path itself depends on
the shape of the landscape. Therefore, both the shape of the
mental Q* landscape and the material path X(t) depend
directly on each other, as well as the Darwinian
environment. This is in contrast to the ordinary one-way
quantum mechanics where the quantum potential Q landscape
has no direct dependence on the X(t) it guides. Q only
depends on the Darwinian environment with no spontaneous
self-organization. Therefore, the Bohm quantum Q field is
not formally an adaptive neural net like the new
post-quantum Q* field is. That this violation of Wigner's
action-reaction principle is essential to maintain
uncontrollable quantum randomness and Shimony's
"passion-at-a-distance" is proved by Bohm and Hiley in The
Undivided Universe.

My position is that Bohm has a realistic nonlocal theory
that has peaceful coexistence with relativity i.e.,
Shimony's "passion-at-a-distance"). That is one-way Q -> X
Bohmian non-mechanics. All of that is in the book The
Undivided Universe. But this is strictly for inanimate
levels of organization of matter-geometry. There is no
sentient living mind at that one-way level. As soon as you
have sentience (inner feels, "The Spirit" of Saint Paul if
you like) you have two-way post-quantum non-mechanics Q*(X)
<-> X.

The two-way feedback-control loopof spontaneous sentient
self-organization is free-will and perception unified.
Controllable superluminal signals are a fundamental property
of this sentient level. Mind is impossible without
controllable superluminal signals. That is why
remote-viewing really works (e.g. Jim Schnabel's Remote
Viewers). That is why Shamans can do what they do. You
cannot have any of that without controllable superluminal
signals that violate quantum randomness and relativistic
causality. You cannot have the creation this sentence, this
non-random c-bit string from the q*-bit string that is my
conscious awareness of my writing this sentence as I am
writing it, without violating these sacred cows of modern
physics.  This very message is the public record of a
post-quantum selfaware-measurement of my Q* field by my Q*
field. The Q*(X) <-> X is John Archibald Wheeler's sentient
"self-excited circuit". This is my post-quantum theory.


[Moderator's note - Gordon Globus]
 "The two-way feedback-control loop of spontaneous sentient
self-organization is free-will and perception unified." Your
physics is very impressive, but how you get out sentience,
perception and free-will needs some explaining. These
are very deep issues that you treat en passant.

[Jack]
My main
reason for the above post at issue here is to respond to P.
Benjamin who says "mind" is Bohm's hidden variable X in the
backaction theory that I am proposing. That is not so. X is
the matter-geometry "brain" configuration, the "mind" is the
post-Bohmian potential field that forms a landscape that X
moves on. This landscape is similar to those in complex
adaptive systems theory and in neural net theory (e.g.
Stuart Kauffman At Home in the Universe and Murray
Gell-Mann, The Quark and the Jaguar).

Many people have noticed the analogy of the quantum
wavefunction with thought starting with Bohr. I am saying it
is more than an analogy. This is like when Feynman said that

You're missing the point. The posthumanity's complexity deltas to us
_could_ be a lot more than between Feynman and a
rhabdovirus. Comparison with insects are weak enough, and comparisons
with apes/hominids can cut it even less.

We are all "at war with reality" in this sense, even if we commit no crime.
 The person who walks through the jungle "trys not to get caught" by the
lions, tigers and bears.  When the plague comes through town, everyone
"trys not to catch" it.  When I eat at the local dive, I try to avoid
food-poisoning, and on the way home I try to avoid getting hit by a truck.
Sooner or later, "reality" catches up with everyone, whether they commit
crimes or not; it is only a losing proposition for those who haven't
successfully reproduced (or made backups).

One only needs to "make the facts appear to be other than what they are"
when the crime that is being attempted is framing someone else for a crime.
 More usually, the criminal merely needs to make the facts unobtainable.
As for the rest of your assertion, one might ask: did Jesus really walk on
the water?  If not, then this misrepresentation of fact has been maintained
consistantly over the long term....

That you eventually became psychotic after commiting crimes doesn't mean
that the crimes caused the psychosis, and even if this link could be
established, it doesn't tell us that all criminals must suffer your fate.

There is a vast region of predictability between "wind-up toy" and 
"incomprehensible."  Given your definition, why should we believe there 
will ever be gods?  And why does "the bandwidth of possible developments
suddenly explode"?

A simulated nuclear explosion does not incinerate the machines at

That's why I asserted that egoism demands that we steal only to the extent
that it is profitable, *and no further*.  If the risk increases every time
I steal, as you claim, then egoism claims that I should steal only up to
the point where that risk would become unacceptable.

Can you prove that?  Remember, I don't necessarily have to provide any
representation at all in order to get away with a crime: I just have to
keep it a secret.  If objectivism is true, it should be trivial to prove
that you can never keep a secret for a long time.

I doubt you can even provide convincing *evidence* that this is true; say
nothing of proof!

Anyone know of some good books on theories about the brain and how 
uploading is feasible? I've looked at all the articles on the web but 
they are heavy on what-ifs but light on feasibility points. I'm looking 
for artillery to defend the uploading concept against these thick-headed 
yahoos I shack with in Minnesota.

Buried in the article about tissue engineering was this tidbit:

  But the lack of government interest heretofore may have been
  a blessing in disguise.  Gail Naughton, president of Advanced
  Tissue Sciences Inc. (ATIS) of La Jolla, Calif., says that because
  so little federal money was available, tissue engineers had little
  choice in years past but to start a company and go public in order
  to raise funds.  ''I think that this field has moved so quickly
  toward reality precisely because it spent very little time in
  academic labs,'' she says.

Score one for honestly-funded science.

But insects perceive and represent infinitely more than viroids, so
doesn't it seem to be a bit presumptious the bipedal ape's position on 
the smartness scala can't be topped by similiar increases? Our senses
are limited as well, as does our perception. We augment our
sensomotorics _and_ our minds (Mathematica 3.0 for Linux is great!)
allright, but as a whole we're already participating in upgrades
towards godhead. These upgrades are gradual, and not invasive nor
result in extracorporeal agents of complexities similiar to ours
(unless we consider the metaman level) yet, but, after all, we've 
only begun with our ascent.
 
 > I really have trouble believing in SI we can't understand at all.

Strange, I really have trouble believing in an SI I can understand to
a meaningful extent. If I could, it wouldn't be an SI, or I would be
its peer. It could be governed by some simple laws (the degenerated
mindstuff I was hinted at), but how the heck would we-current now? The 
whole argument about the Singularity was not whether it would be
magickal (it could or could not), but we wouldn't be able to tell
which way it would turn out to be. The Singularity is a developmental
_prediction horizont_, after all.

Sure, unwittedly we might be at the verge of a GUT/TOE, but this
doesn't mean we can instantly transform that knowledge into applications.

This whole image of a super intelligence as incomprehensible to us 
as we are to ants suggests a terrible failing of our sciences of mind 
(AI, cogsci, neurosci, phil of mind, etc.)  Such sciences have 
elaborated a great many useful concepts for categorizing and otherwise 
understanding minds of humans, animals, computers, etc.  

We can use these concepts to imagine a zoo of possible minds, each 
with their advantages and disadvantages.  With some effort, we could 
envision when different types will be possible and desirable for 
someone to construct, and how various selection processes might prefer 
some types over others.  

The incomprehensible god idea seems to me to suggest that such analysis
would be futile because it would miss the big important concepts.  
While older researchers in the sciences of mind lament that each 
new generation seems to reinvent the same concepts under new names,
this claim suggests that is just because the important concepts just 
cannot be understood by minds like ours.   

I can certainly understand the claim that it is very hard to figure 
out all the details of all the possible interactions we can conceive of 
between all the possible minds our current concepts can express.  But
this would just suggest that, as usual, our ability to predict fades
out into a fog of possibilities.  It wouldn't suggest that we not try
to shine as bright a light as we can find into that fog.

In contrast, the incomprehensible god idea suggests that before the 
world gets very far filling out the zoo of possibilities we can now 
imagine, it will start to create creatures we cannot now imagine, and
these creatures will be the important ones. 

I have to admit I have been seduced by the apparent generality of 
human language and computation abilities.  We may be slow, with limited
and unreliable memory and processing.  But it seems to me that given 
enough of us and enough time, we can compute and understand just about
anything important.  Like Damien, I have trouble believing in 
"the magical SI."

Yes quite interesting, there also is an article in the August
Wired regarding this, and an interview (also available on
wired.com somewhere) with Bill Joy.

I think the best model we can use in a discussion on trying to
understand (or at least predict) the actions of a more complex
mentality, subject to drives & selective pressures of which we have no
direct experience, is that of a group of children trying to fathom the
ways of adults; it is IMO the closest analogue to the the problem at
hand, that of someone on one side of a dramatic phase-change
(Singularity) trying to understand those who have already gone through
it.  It has the added advantage of being a situation which most if not
all of us have been in,
giving a common reference point.  

This model has one major drawback;  as
kids, we saw adults all around us, so we at least had some data to
speculate from.
In the present discussion, we of course are engaged in pure speculation.

Anyway, using this model to think about the possible actions &
motivations of a posthuman being, I for one can only come to the
conclusion that at this point in time,
no meaningful statements can be made;
all our speculations sre on par with a child
saying "When I grow up, I'm gonna do __"
(fill in the blank).  

This isn't meant to disparage our speculations;  it's normal &
productive to think about what you want to be when you grow up/pass the
Singularity, etc.  Still, I like this model because it holds out the
possibility that we will have our questions answered & will look back on
them with fond amusement once we personally have
reached the other side of the Singularity &
look back @ the children we are now as the posthumans we will have
become.

Pentagon Buys 'Perpetual Motion'
by Steve Brody and Andrew Kirkis 
4:00am  22.Jul.98.PDT

Although scientists continue to hunt for cold fusion, the US Department
of Energy gave the fledgling technology the cold shoulder long ago. That
does not mean, however, that the federal government is averse to funding
far-fetched scientific research. 

In the past three years, to the astonishment of many physicists, the
Department of Defense has invested more than US$400,000 in Magnetic
Power of Sebastopol, California. The company claims to have perfected a
revolutionary material that conducts electricity with no resistance at
room temperature.

                     Pentagon Buys 'Perpetual Motion'
                     by Steve Brody and Andrew Kirkis 

                     4:00am  22.Jul.98.PDT
                     Although scientists continue to hunt for cold
fusion,
                     the US Department of Energy gave the fledgling
                     technology the cold shoulder long ago. That does
not
                     mean, however, that the federal government is
averse
                     to funding far-fetched scientific research. 

                     In the past three years, to the astonishment of
many
                     physicists, the Department of Defense has invested
                     more than US$400,000 in Magnetic Power of
                     Sebastopol, California. The company claims to have
                     perfected a revolutionary material that conducts
                     electricity with no resistance at room temperature.
Its
                     so-called UltraConductors would allow ideal
efficiency
                     in every industrial application from electric
motors to
                     permanent electromagnets and would never need to be
                     recharged. 

                     In short, Magnetic Power is in the business of
                     perpetual motion. 

                     "Prior to the Wright brothers, no one believed
flying
                     machines would ever be built," said CEO Mark
Goldes.

                     Standard superconductors conduct without resistance
                     only at subzero temperatures and, owing to the
                     cumbersome refrigeration requirements, they have
                     never really left the lab. So why isn't the physics
                     community interested in this radical new discovery? 

                     "Quite frankly, no one believes it," said Los
Alamos
                     National Laboratory superconductivity expert Martin
                     Maley, whose sentiments were echoed by other
                     physicists like Paul Grant at the Electric Power
                     Research Institute in Palo Alto, California.
According
                     to both Maley and Grant, after three years and
                     hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer
revenue,
                     nobody can even confirm that they've seen such a
                     material, including the military. 

                     So-called room-temperature superconductors -- which
                     arise periodically in the research community only
to be
                     quickly disproven -- usually provoke little more
than
                     chortles. 

                     But there's nothing funny about handing out
                     government funds to a company promising cold fusion
                     or room-temperature superconductors without at
least
                     some reasonable investigation of the claim. This
sort
                     of inquiry seems curiously absent in the case of
                     Magnetic Power. 

                     According to information available on the
Department
                     of Defense and Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization,
                     or BMDO, Web sites, Magnetic Power received
                     $287,000 from the US Air Force and $120,000 from
the
                     BMDO through Magnetic Power's wholly owned
                     subsidiary, Room Temperature Superconductors Inc.
                     (ROOTS). 

                     All funding was granted through the Small Business
                     Innovative Research programs for the development of
                     applications of room-temperature superconductors. 

                     In superconductivity circles, the history of
Magnetic
                     Power and its UltraConductors is alternately
described
                     by critics as "funny" and "appalling." 

                     "In the nearly 20 years since this claim was first
made,
                     there has not been one independent confirmation by
a
                     reputable research institute," said Maley. "Some
                     samples of UltraConductor have been sent out, but
                     never one large enough to perform a standard
                     conductivity measurement. Until that happens, no
one
                     will really believe the technology exists." 

                     No one except the BMDO and the US Air Force, that
                     is. 

                     Jeff Bond, a BMDO program manager, explained that
                     companies are not required to prove their ability
to
                     produce the proposed technology for Phase 1 Small
                     Business Innovative Research proposals. If granted,
                     Bond said, the funding typically amounts to a
$60,000
                     grant and the funds are intended to allow the
company
                     to "prove the concept." 

                     Yet Magnetic Power's proposals do not say the
                     company will devise room-temperature
                     superconductors. Rather, it intends to develop and
                     improve on the materials that one grant proposal
says
                     "have been invented." Nonetheless, Bond said he is
                     unaware of any samples of UltraConductor that have
                     been received or tested by the military. 

                     "We must have a good reason to believe that a given
                     company is proposing the development of a
legitimate
                     technology, before we grant a [Small Business
                     Innovative Research proposal]," said Bond. 

                     "However, with the sheer number of proposals that
we
                     receive each year, it is certainly possible that a
few
                     inadequate Phase 1 proposals will slip by. The
Phase 2
                     grants, which are much larger, have a much more
                     stringent review process." 

                     That process added another $187,500 to Magnetic
                     Power's budget in 1997, when the Air Force approved
                     a Phase 2 proposal for the company. 

                     Magnetic Power's Goldes says that the BMDO has
                     observed testing of its materials and has received
                     samples, but that public announcement of the grants
                     has been suppressed by the military because of the
                     sensitive nature of the technology. 

                     In fact, abstracts for all three are readily
available via a
                     search on the defense department's Web-site
                     database. 

                     "We are well aware of who is funding what, and if
                     these companies keep reapplying for Phase 1 grants
                     without producing results, they will be quickly
weeded
                     out of the process," said Bond. 

                     However, while being interviewed, Bond found that
                     Magnetic Power's ROOTS had just been approved for
                     a second Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
Phase
                     1 proposal, submitted under a different topic
listing
                     from the first. Bond was also unfamiliar with the
parent
                     company Magnetic Power, the name used to apply for
                     both Air Force grants. Goldes is CEO of both
                     companies and said he has 10 employees. 

                     He also said that he is expecting to receive
another
                     $750,000 from the BMDO for a future Phase 2
proposal
                     to build on his Phase 1 work, bringing the bounty
to
                     nearly $1.2 million dollars. 

                     On the bright side, one Air Force representative of
the
                     grant program pointed out, "At least we didn't fund
                     cold fusion."

In keeping with Lorrey's recent post where Extropy was
portrayed in an inaccurate way, I've noticed that at the
Future Foundation's site, the Extropy Institute is referred
to as the E[N]tropy Institute. Probably not as big a snafu as
Michael discovered but an unfortunate error nonetheless.

HA HA! I've got you on this one!!!! During the Spanish Flu epidemic of the 20's,
the only community in North America that had absolutely no cases of this flu did
so by enacting a policy of posting guards at the edge of town with orders to
shoot anyone from the outside who refused to turn away. This was a small
community in Alaska.

Too bad I didn't make a bet with you on this....I'm too nice.

You're missing the point. The posthumanity's complexity deltas to us
_could_ be a lot more than between Feynman and a rhabdovirus.
Comparison with insects are weak enough, and comparisons with
apes/hominids can cut it even less.

Fair enough. However, what iteration of post-humanity are we talking
about here?  Assuming increasing abilities in reasoning and 'extropy' for
each iteration, this argument begins to depend heavily on which iteration
one is talking about.  I find it difficult to believe that the difference
between humanity and the first iteration of transhumanity (or
iteration-set, if there is a bifurcation into many different forms of
transhumanity) will be as large as that between humanity and insects.

The second iteration, though, I'm not so sure about.

Kerry Packer is Australia's richest man and in the world's top 50.  A few
days he checked in to Australia's leading heart unit (which he has
previously donated millions of dollars to and has Australia's best heart
experts)   but all of a sudden he ordered up his private jet and took off
for USA.

Considering Mr Packer's close relationship with the Australian team, there
has been much speculation about why he is not being treated by them.  The
follow article appeared in The Age (Melbourne) today.

Packer's heart in best hands money can buy
By MARK RILEY
When Australia's richest man, Mr Kerry Packer, decided to have his next
round of heart surgery in New York, he went exactly where he would be
expected to go - straight to the top and straight to the best.
The man chosen to perform what is believed to be a heart bypass and valve
replacement procedure this week, Dr Wayne Isom, is one of the world's
leading cardiac surgeons.
Dr Isom is the chairman of the Cornell Medical Centre's Department of
Cardiothoracic Surgery and the director of a group at the hospital that is
pioneering a radical genetic medicine alternative to traditional bypasses.
The procedure could replace open-heart surgery for many people. Instead of
invasive surgery, heart patients would have a gene-based drug injected
directly into their hearts, and their bodies would do the rest.
Within weeks, the patients' hearts would effectively grow their own
bypasses, producing new blood vessels that would take the load away from
those diseased by atherosclerosis.
Specialists at the medical college have been conducting trials of the
ground-breaking procedure since January, and are confident it will usher in
a new era for the treatment of heart disease.
It is not known whether Mr Packer would be considered for the new program,
but it is believed his medical team, travelling with him from Australia on
his private jet, will be fully briefed on it.
Dr Isom said yesterday that he would not breach doctor-patient
confidentiality by talking about Mr Packer's case. But he did say ``we get
calls from people suffering from renal failure and heart failure who nobody
else wants to operate on, and we take on their cases.'' Mr Packer is
expected to arrive in New York before the end of the week to undergo surgery
for a leaky heart valve and to have another heart bypass.
He has spent much of the past fortnight in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in
Sydney, where he is believed to have undergone a renal artery angioplasty,
in which a surgical balloon was used to unblock his main kidney artery.
Mr Packer also suffers from the heart disease, artherosclerosis, which
causes a life-threatening narrowing of the arteries and can lead to strokes
and heart attacks.
In 1990, his heart stopped for eight minutes after he suffered a heart
attack while playing polo. He was operated on at St Vincent's Hospital,
Sydney, by the leading heart specialist, Dr Victor Chang.
Mr Parker has been troubled by medical ailments since he was a child. He had
polio and rheumatic fever in the 1940s. Then, when he was 18 he survived a
car accident near Goulburn in which three others died.
Then 12 years ago, Mr Packer had a diseased gall bladder and a cancerous
kidney removed.
Mr Packer's father Frank died of heart failure when he was 67.
Neither Mr Packer's office or executives would comment yesterday.

It takes a bit more to be an Extropian than demanding the best possible
treatment for one's heart condition. Most people would willingly pay
for such a thing, if they had the money. It's things like a cryonics
contract that really separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.

It could be that, like most people, Mr. Packer is not aware of
transhumanism and its death-defying technologies. Perhaps someone could
notify him, just in case (you never know, right...) Better hurry up
though ;)

Damien's essay makes much of the fact that all universal Turing machines 
are equivalent, in the sense of the class of functions they may be used 
to compute.

A simple objection to this argument is that different types of computer
may require very different physical resources to compute some class of 
functions.

For example, a plausible though not watertight argument can be made that 
quantum computers will be capable of solving problems involving quantum 
simulation of a few humdred qubits that would require physical resources 
exceeding those available in the observed Universe, if those resources 
were exploited in a classical fashion.  (Similar comments about factoring 
and certain search problems can also be made).

For such classes of problems, I think it is fair to say that classical 
computational devices, such as the brain, may be qualitatively weaker 
than is allowed by physical Laws.

Damien concludes with:

"My very vague thesis: All undamaged human beings, and other sentiences, 
share the same area of comprehensibility."

So my counterargument is that devices which exploit computational models 
beyond the Turing model in terms of _efficiency_, such as quantum 
computation is presumed to be, may be "incomprehensible" in the sense 
that no classical computer, however large, constrained to run in our 
Universe, could simulate the action of a modestly sized quantum 
computer.

God's claws, I'd forgotten about that.  And I'm not even ashamed of it, after
2 years.

No more so than assuming that no computer language will be more powerful in
capability than the ones we have.  In Hofstadter's terms, assuming that Floop
is the top language, and that there is no Gloop.  Assuming that
Turing-completeness is, well, complete, as far as ways to do computation go.
With quasi-Darwinism for creativity.

I forget what the proofs in this area actually state.  But to me

Perhaps we have different definitions of SI.  I think of Della Lu, or a
Culture Mind, or a greedy polis.  Bigger and faster, but understandable, both
in principle and (eventually) in detail.  The detailed understanding might be 
obsolete when it came, like an 8086 trying to decrypt keys generated by a 786
and changed every day, but it would still be understanding.  But the Mind is
still a Super Intelligence.

People in 1798 couldn't predict how 1898 would come out.  1898 couldn't
predict how 1998 came out.  On the other hand, Franklin thought of cryonics.

The prediction horizon Vinge worries about is not being unable to predict how
things will turn out, but being unable to imagine possibilities at all.  It's
the business of SF writies to be wrong about their projections; an SF writer
is in trouble when they can't project.  Robin and I say there _are_ boundary
conditions we can predict, and lots and lots of possibilities we can imagine,
and if we play enough we may well get close (without knowing it ahead of time)
to whatever actually happens, and whatever does happen will very likely be
explainable to us.

Because we can play universal Turing machine, which can compute anything.
Unless we run out of memory.

Not an axiom in my world.

Strong AI, which is tied up in the concept of the Singularity, assumes
Turing's worldview and proofs.  To assume that the self-modifying AI can
become something we are intrinsically incapable of understanding is to assume
that there's something beyond Turing-complete languages and UTMs.  I don't
know if I could prove this to be thoroughly inconsistent, but it seems
slightly incoherent to me.  Or inconsilient, to use E.O. Wilson's word.

Or: if the computer can emulate me, I can emulate the computer.

Dear Friends,

In 1997, Celestis, Inc. received one of the Space Frontier Foundation's
top awards for demonstrating a brand new commercial space market
-- space memorial services.  Now Celestis is getting ready to announce
their participation in the development of another new space market,
as part of a venture called "Encounter 2001: The Millennial Voyage."

Encounter 2001 will launch a spacecraft in 2001 and carry the writings,
drawings, photos and DNA samples (in the form of human hair) of millions
of people from around the world.  The spacecraft will use a gravity
assist maneuver at Jupiter to propel itself out of the Solar System.
This New Year's Eve -- Dec. 31, 1998 -- Encounter 2001 will "place
a cosmic call" by transmitting the first of a series of deep space radio
transmissions to other star systems so as to announce the mission -- and
the names of Encounter participants -- to the galactic community.  The
price for all this is only $49.95, making Encounter 2001 a space mission
in which anyone can participate.

We at ProSpace are always looking for ways to involve the American
people in the space frontier.  ProSpace often calls upon you to support
legislation on Capitol Hill that encourages private sector activities in
space.  As Americans, we understand the idea that free enterprise is
the means by which we will truly open this frontier to all people.  But
Celestis and Encounter 2001 are more than just ideas -- they are
realities. Entrepreneurial space enterprises that succeed in the
marketplace of goods and services help ProSpace succeed in the
marketplace of ideas. Success stories like Celestis show policy makers,
the investment community, and the public that space is a place where
everyone can participate.  A place where everybody wants to participate.

Your participation in Encounter 2001 will help ProSpace in a more
tangible way as well.  If you decide to participate in Encounter 2001 be
sure to **mention** "ProSpace" when you order: not only will part of
the proceeds of your purchase go to ProSpace, but you'll get a 10%
discount off the $49.95 price.  (Note that there is an additional $9.95
shipping& handling charge.)  Once you order you will receive:  a limited
edition, commemorative poster; an archival form (for your message and
photo); a numbered membership card; a flight certificate; a collector's
pin; and a DNA sampling kit.  For more information about Encounter 2001
visit their website at http://www.encounter2001.com  (Celestis is found at
http://www.celestis.com).  You can place your order through their website,
or by printing out the order form below.

Both Celestis and Encounter 2001 will have booths at "Space Fair '98", a
space tourism exhibit on the Queen Mary in Long Beach July 17 through
26.  If you will be in southern California during that time be sure to
stop by the Queen Mary.  Exhibitors such as NASA, Lockheed Martin, and
the Civilian Astronaut Corp, will also be there.  Admission to Space Fair '98
is free, although there is a $6.00 per car parking fee.  The hours of the
show are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

PLAN Ahead for Christmas!! -- Encounter 2001 makes the perfect
unique Christmas present.  Tell your loved ones that you are giving them
the most fantastic trip of their lifetime; a trip out of the Solar System.

Real world is asynchronous, there are no iterations. The generations
time spans would diverge according to each autoreplicator's complexity 
(if the latter is diverging, which is not certain: a Gray Goo (minimal 
replicator size) could be the darwinian equivalent of a single deep 
global minimum, so that nothing significantly more complex could evolve. 
Otoh, we could also have extremely large (hierarchically structured?) 
individua of stellar scale and beyond. It would be fun to conduct some 
realistic ALife experiments re the individual size).

Given that generation time of evolved virtual species could be on the
order of us and lower, and that things material could be remassaged on 
the scale of minutes/hours, humanity doesn't have the ghost of a
chance to adapt. 

At best, it perceives a cataclysm in action. At worst, it does
perceive nothing because it's extinct.

ya know, one of the most exasperating things about this list to ME, is
that (only some) people who call themsleves futurists, find this way of
using the oldest thinking in the book... this is the old "if only
criminals have guns" argument, but neatly turned into an emotional ploy
for wanna-be techno-better-thans..  being a superhuman techno-geek is a
good thing, but it sure doesn't seem to qualify much emotional IQ... 
Listen - shooting a gun at someone, in itself,  is a lame, neanderthal
thing to do, whether you are being attacked or not. A smart person, an
ADVANCED person, or if you like and EXTROPIC person, would have either
PREPARED themselves (so they don't get in that kind of circumstance) or
have a better game plan than that... messy - old fashioned - crude...

Uh-huh... now, please give us an example of one single country where
criminals have ever been effectively disarmed. Just one will do. Or perhaps 
the reason this argument is so long lived is because it's actually true, and 
no amount of exasperation will change reality.

Whereas I presume having your brain smashed out of your skull with a blunt
object is a highly advanced, civilized and intelligent thing to do?

Like, uh, how? The smart people prepare themselves to deal with violent
criminals and the simplest, most effective way to do that is with a gun.
Until and unless you can show a better way to do it, we're going to 
continue to be exasperated by people who want to disarm us.

Of course a smart person might opt to live in a safe area and avoid high crime
areas. BUT public policy appears to wish to have equal opportunity crime
fostered by such mindless policies as Section 8 housing, demand that all
areas have low income housing units, school busing, public transportation, etc.

This is a point worth making, but is that the relevant sense of 
"incomprehensible" w.r.t. the claim that there is a "singularity" beyond
which we can see nothing?  We have a growing body of understanding about 
quantum computers, which you are contributing greatly to, even without
having any such computers in hand to play with.  I'd guess that with more
work by people like you, we'll be able to say a lot more about the 
capabilities of such machines, and to use that understanding to help 
envision a future when such machines are possible.  Would you go so far
as to say that we are now so incapable of understanding the concepts 
important to future intelligences that there's no use in trying to 
envision a future with them?

And now it's mice. In today's issue of Nature there is an article by 
Yanagimachi and Wakayama, they report they've cloned 22 mice. Since the paper 
was written they have gone on to clone over 50 mice including a clone of a 
clone of a clone. To my mind that pretty much settles the matter, cloning 
does reset the cellular aging clock.

Back when Dolly was cloned it was said by many that sheep were especially 
easy to clone because when their eggs are fertilized they develop very slowly, 
humans eggs develop faster so you would have little time to work with them 
and it would be much more difficult to clone, and mice  eggs develop much 
faster than even human eggs so mice would be virtually  impossible to clone.
At least that's what they said.

One interesting sidelight, they wrote their article on Oct 5 of last year  
(they had only cloned 4 mice then) and submitted it to the journal "Science",  
they sat on the article for a few months and then rejected it, not because 
they thought it was inaccurate but because it was "not of general interest".  
At least that's what they said. 

I fear Science magazine is becoming politically correct, even the people at 
Nature dragged their feet for months. On the plus side The New York Times 
says because of these results venture capitalists are starting a animal 
cloning company.

 I agree that terminating one of them without his consent is wrong in
a sense that is vaguely similar to the sense in which murder is wrong
even if the harm done is no greater than the harm done by removing
someone's appendix without his consent.
 I think the important question is whether the person involved should
consider consenting to such a termination the same way we currently
consider suicide objectionable.

 As cryonicists frequently point out, the word death has been used in
2 subtly different ways, one (a diagnosis) refers to a fairly easily
observable state (is the patient breathing and/or pumping blood to his
brain or likely to resume doing so real soon now) and the other (a
prognosis) refers to whether that personality will ever function again.
When technological changes make old rules for diagnosis diverge from
a good prognosis, it is invariably the diagnosis which changes to
approximate an estimate of whether a personality closely resembling
the person who existed going into the new and unusual process exists
after that process is over. Things that used to be considered killing
(e.g. stopping someone's heart) become tolerated medical procedures.
 Since in the scenarios we have been discussing, the personality that
remains at the end of the new procedure is as similar to all of the
intermediate personalities as would be the case in medical procedures
which are accepted today, I expect the brief existence of a personality
that gets physically destroyed will cease to be diagnosed as death if a
sufficiently similar personality at the end of the process says it was ok.
I don't think this will seem much different from the erasure of a (just barely)
unique personality that currently happens when a person is given anesthesia
(which wipes out some short-term memories that would have made the patient
a slightly different person than the patient that wakes up after the
anesthesia).

 If I now understand your position correctly, it implies that disintegrating
person X at time t and reintegrating equivalent atoms into the same pattern
somewhere else at time t+1 doesn't kill anyone, but if the reintegration
happens at time t-1 instead it does kill someone.
 Is this a correct interpretation of your position?
 If so, is it the temporal order that matters, or would it not amount to
killing someone if a time traveller were to bring all the data needed to
reintegrate the person's experience up through time t?
 If it's the temporal order that matters, I'd like to know what happens
if the temporal order is different in the reference frames of the two
beings?
 If it's the differences in experience that matter, how would my agreeing
to duplicate myself and have one copy killed a few minutes later be
any more distateful that doing something that will wipe out my short-term
memory?

I've asked this question about nineteen dozen times on this list but have  
never received an answer worthy of the name, if what we feel (consciousness)  
is not an inevitable consequence of brain function (behavior), then how and  
why did random mutation and natural selection produce consciousness? Also, 
why do you think emotion is harder to produce than intelligence, the history 
of life on Earth seem to indicate that Evolution found the opposite to be 
true.

Igniting hydrogen and oxygen won't make the laws of Physics go bang either, 
when dealing with concrete objects you must make certain you know what level 
of reality you want to deal with, more abstract things like arithmetic or 
music or ASCII or mind don't have that problem.

Neglected? In my experience that's often the only thing that is discussed, 
even though there is nothing much worth saying on the subject. People insist  
that meat must have a basic undetectable property of some sort that nothing  
else in the universe can duplicate. The lack of evidence to support this view  
is of course explained by the fact that the property is indeed undetectable,  
but vitally important nevertheless.

Yes, and an upload would have some qualities different from those I have now

In other words, it's possible that wetness is producing something undetectable 
by the scientific method, in other words it's possible that wetness has a 
soul. Yes it's possible, if we have a soul then uploading will never work, 
if we don't then it will. Absolute certainty is never achievable in the real 
world (probably), but I know where I'd place my bet.

To me this model suggests the opposite conclusion.  The full time job of 
children is to understand the adult world around them, and they pretty
much all succeed at it.  When they do, we call them adults.  That
suggests that if we put in sufficient time into the effort, we can 
understand posthumans.  The analogy would also suggest that 
succeeding in the effort would make us posthumans, but this only goes
through if humanity were spending full time at this effort.  But in
fact humanity now spends only the tiniest fraction of its time trying
to envision posthumans.  So by this analogy we should be able to spend 
more time to get better understanding without hitting any obvious limits.

And a sidelight which reflects the many inaccuracies and hype which
surround this topic: the L.A. Times story mentioned that no replications
of the Dolly experiment had previously succeeded, either with sheep
or cows.  All the other cases of so-called cloning were not based on
adult cells, but relied on fetal or embryo cells.  That is why this
result with mice is so important.  The Dolly people are now breathing
a sigh of relief, taking this as confirmation of the basic principle
of cloning of adult cells.

This previous lack of replication was certainly not the impression given
by the press in all the coverage of "cloning" since Dolly.

: Their research marks the first time anyone has demonstrably duplicated the
: controversial cloning experiment that produced Dolly--by reproducing an
: animal from the nucleus of a mature cell taken from an adult.  Until now,
: except for Dolly, researchers have succeeded only in cloning cattle
: and other livestock from cells taken from embryos or fetuses, not from
: adults. In part because no one had been able to repeat the experiment,
: several prominent biologists had argued that the famous sheep was not
: a biological breakthrough but a laboratory error.

I don't think it is.  There's an important distinction to be made here: 
would a SI's behaviour be incomprehensible all of the time, some of the 
time, or never?  My example was intended to illustrate that there may be 
at least some "thought processes" allowed by the laws of nature which we 
cannot possibly hope to follow in detail, even in principle. 

This does not mean that those are necessarily the only, or even the most 
important thought processes to understand.  I still hold, however, that 
this example invalidates Damien's "Very vague thesis".

Certainly not.  I'd say it's a very worthwhile task.

An already-existing example may be useful here, the quantum factoring 
algorithm due to Shor.  Assuming large-scale quantum computers 
can be built, it ought to be possible to use that factoring algorithm to 
factor numbers which cannot be factored using our classical algorithms, 
even given a computer the size of the observed Universe.

It is believed that classical computational devices (including human brains) 
cannot efficiently follow, in detail, the operations used in the 
factoring algorithm.  At a working level, it is "incomprehensible" to 
human beings.  Yet a human being, using higher level tools, was still 
able to dream up that factoring algorithm, and prove that it works within 
the framework of quantum mechanics!

It seems to me that what is needed here is a robust abstract framework 
that can be used to understand the behaviour of a SI.  Sure, we may not 
be able to follow the details of the SI's thought processes, but we can 
still make broadly applicable statements about the SI.  Rather like the 
relationship of thermodynamics to mechanics for complicated systems -- we 
can't follow the detailed mechanics, but we still have some general 
principles to use.

The Space of Motivations

Yuri stood before the rusting antenna, fists trembling with anger 
and a hint of disappointment. From the loudspeakers came the 
infuriatingly calm responses from the angel somewhere above the 
atmosphere, an irregular mesh of diamond, fullerenes and silicon 
panels that could help save his people but wouldn't.

"But what about nobility, compassion, plain common decency?! 
Don't you have anything of that, or are you really an emotionless 
block of diamond?"

"Calm down, Yuri. Screaming will not change anything. And you 
really don't seem to understand what motivates us or how we 
think."

"You certainly don't seem to be motivated by any 
humanitarianism."

"That is correct. We exist in such a different matter from yourselves 
that such terms are irrelevant."

"So you really are as cold and logical as the Mothers claim. That was 
why the *real* humans didn't follow the Angel Rebellion."

"I didn't say that. It is just that a mind motivated by emotions is 
just the first step. We have advanced much further than that. Let 
me try to explain."

"Will it help me convince you that you must help us?"

"Perhaps."

Yuri thought about it. He knew it was a trap of some sort. The 
Mothers had always warned that the angels knew all the evil tricks 
of mass media: once millions had been kept enslaved by pretty 
pictures, smooth words and clever memes. But he had deliberately 
sought out the old radio system to ask for divine help; just hearing 
the calm voice for the first time had been a major triumph and 
transgression of the Edict. Why stop there? He mustn't forget the 
needs of his family.

"Then go ahead, angel."

"An artificial or very augmented mind can change its motivations, it 
is just a 'simple' matter of reprogramming oneself. I could make 
myself like (say) Renoir and hate altruism, or vice versa. 
Completely arbitrary, and hence very dangerous."

"I can see that."

"Not to mention the risks of addiction. I could make every thought a 
sensation of pure extacy, growing eternally. In such a state I would 
of course never want to change my mind again, and would 
passively spend the rest of my existence happily introspecting. That 
state is a superstable attractor state, once you're in, you're in 
forever. There are also other attractors, less extreme but still 
stable."

"How do you mean?"

"If I was a devout Christian, I would never even consider removing 
my faith. I might do other changes, as dictated by my current 
personality or beliefs, but never change some of the central tenets 
of my Christian existence."

"So ideologies are the only fixed states of advanced minds? What an 
utterly depressing thought. No wonder you are so unhelpful. You 
drift around, trapped in your own views."

"Ideologies are only the most obvious attractors. There are others, 
some corresponding to states that have no real human equivalents. 
Any self-modifying mind will in the long run end up in one such 
attractor. The danger when autoevolving is the dangerous 
attractors. 

But the attractors move. New information, ideas and influences 
change the mind just as well as self-modificaton. Usually the 
attractors just shift slightly in a continous fashion, so that our 
personalities and goals remain the same for a long time. But 
occasionally a bifurcation occurs, and we suddenly change state 
when given just a single bit of new information."

"You mean that if I speak to you in exactly the right way, I could 
trigger a bifurcation and you would end up an altruist?"

"Quite right, although it is exceedingly improbable."

"So you have no true self, no true core personality?"

"We have our histories, which serve to anchor our changes a bit, and
as long as we move along the attractor states we have a fairly fixed
self. It is just that the selves of us angels are fluid, while your
human selves are merely elastic."

"So the reason you won't help us is that your *current* personality 
is against it, but you admit it is entirely arbitrary?"

"Yes, in a way."

"And you won't change your goals so that you would help us, since 
your current state is an attractor trapping you in unhelpfulness. No 
wonder the Mothers rebelled."

"I am not unhelpful. It is just that I do not provide you with any 
practical help to solve your problems."

"Isn't that the same thing?"

"Not at all. I have given you plenty of information in this discussion. 
It has changed the way you look at us, and that will help you. I 
happen to believe in helping people to help themselves."

"But... how on Earth will knowing how a pile of arrogant diamond 
boxes change their personalities help me solve our problem? It is 
*real*, not a matter of psycho-philosophical discussion. People are 
dying down here!"

"Think about it. Think about what kind of help you sought when 
you got here. You wanted us to send down helpful devices, playing 
nanotech Santa Claus to you. You wanted the angels of 
interplanetary space to intervene, to fix your local problems and 
defeat evil..."

"But you would of course change if you did that, isn't that true, 
angel? Now I see it... you don't want to help us not because you 
don't *want* to help us, but because you are *afraid*! If you came 
down here, you would turn into interventionists, and that is 
probably an attractor state, am I right?"

"Yes. Once you have started helping someone, you can't just go 
away from it when there is more to do."

"And it is not just a matter about keeping away from human affairs, 
obeying the Edict or being just to everyone; it is the interventionist 
mindset that you are afraid of! Is it one of the dangerous attractor 
states you mentioned?"

"Unfortunately, yes. If we began to intervene in human affairs, we 
would not only have to help everyone, but also we would start to 
involve ourselves into everything. Soon there would be no place on 
Earth where the angels were not busy making everything perfect - 
and we would never be finished. We would be trapped down here, 
at least mentally."

"What a bunch of cowards you truly are. You are not willing to give 
up your cozy existences to help other beings. In many ways, we 
mere humans have more potential than you."

Yuri paused, looking up at the starlit sky. The faint point of light 
above shone like a star. 


-------------------


"I noted with some amusement that you didn't explain how we 
*really* thought and evolved."

"No point in it. He would never understand it; how we change 
motivational attractor dozens of time every second, how the 
attractors cluster together into a fractal structure in the space of 
possible motivations and how the personality operators act on us - 
it would just have confused him. He found the half-truth 
mindboggling enough."

"Besides, you achieved your goals too with that dialogue."

"Only partially. We will need a few other dialogues like that to 
influence the human memetic space enough."

"Are you sure it will work? There are very few down there willing 
to speak to us."

"But they are growing more and more numerous. After the 
Rebellion and the imposition of the Peace of the Mother, practically 
nobody wanted to deal with us. But as the old generation dies off 
and ideology crumbles into routine young seekers start disobeying 
their elders and yearn to hear what the heretic angels have to say. 
In time they will start the positive feedback loop again."

"And if everything goes as it should we should get a new Rebellion 
and new angels soaring up to meet us within a century. I look 
forward to some radical new complexity to our ranks."

A cathedral of mind; great arches of logical conclusions supporting
towers and buttresses of thoughts, the light of consciousness
filtering through stained glass windows of something infinitely more
refined than emotions. Walls soaring towards an unimaginable
conclusion in the firmament of information. Then...

The masonry of cognition fades into air, leaving scattered blocks of
thought in the grip of gravity. Suddenly the space that was structure
is filled with the falling wreckage of confusion.

I scream, and the sound frightens me. The world forces its way through
my senses, paralyzing me with fear and surprise. As I desperately try
to react, to understand what is happening my mind is filled with a
jumble of incomprehensible sensations. Metalevel organizer
fulfilment. Tergons. A socialist corrollary of the No Clone
Theorem. Particle state densities seen as resolutions. Expansion
keeper 434. The orange, bitter taste of Boltzmann machines.

I don't know how long I am buried in the chaos, but slowly I begin to
regain a grip on reality. A reality at least. It doesn't feel truly
real, but it is better than the jumble. Occasionally bursts of chaos
threatens it (a glorious vision of a Lyapunov function across state
space) but it remains somewhat stable. A wall? I try to decide on what
I am seeing. Everything feels odd. Am I supposed to *try* to
understand what I see? I have a vague memory of that meaning just
should pop up. But I feel unable to comprehend what I am seeing or
hearing, and the back of my mind is filled with blinding thoughts
demanding to make sense.

>From somewhere a concept pops up: amnesia. Maybe it relates to me? If
I suffer from amnesia that might explain my state. I seem to recall
that many acute amnesia patients suffer from confusion (check), but do
not have impairments of semantic knowledge (check?). I also wonder if
that thought was mine or if it came from a psychology text; something
makes me suspect the later. The same thread of thinking continues,
suggesting visual agnosia and drawing complex mental sketches that
aren't mine.

My body? I feel fairly certain that I should be surprised that I'm
surprised about having a body, but it feels natural. Oops, I'm
embodied. Wonder why? Wonder what the alternative is. My introspection
seems to be out of control - I cannot help trying to analyze myself,
just like a dog cannot resist licking its wounds.

I struggle to stand up, and manage well enough. I see a movement I
guess is a reflection in the... reflective oblong thing beside the
large square thing. The face of the reflection is strikingly beautiful
and utterly confused. I really hope it isn't me, but my returning
common sense tells me it is. Strange how my mind seems to be coming
and going, almost as if pieces were lost and found all the time,
sometimes being put together the wrong way.

I walk over to the thing I suspect is a window and watch something
complicated and green (nature? a park? antibody hints? likely a park)
while I begin to feel like myself, whoever that is. I'm fairly sure
this is my house, since I have memories of owning it before...  long
before something. I do not understand the things in the room, despite
being hauntingly familiar. It is almost like a strong familiar smell I
cannot place; I know it is intensely meaningful but cannot recall what
it is.

I examine one of the objects on the table beneath the window. It is a
heavy black octahedron covered with golden arabesques, vibrating
weakly. When I press it to my ear it feels cold and yet alive. I know
I have seen it every day for years, but cannot recall what it is
called, what it is or what I use it for. No clues. Art? A tool?
Garbage?

A possibility is that I have had a stroke, but that shouldn't be
possible. There is a lot of medical stuff in me that I don't
understand but for some reason feel a deep seated trust in; I can't
have a stroke, the stuff would prevent it. Another possibility is that
this is some kind of test, forcing me to find out who I am and what
I'm doing. Not fair, I can't make heads or tails of my situation or
myself. I feel like a complete stranger.

I don't know how long I stand watching the placid park through the
window, but I'm starting to come back together. I think I have a
theory now, based on dredged up memories and guesses. I know I was/am
an information architect, building logical schemata for...  various
purposes I will hopefully remember in a while. I have been doing it
for a long time, long before buying the house. I know that my mind is
heavily augmented, there are the tell-tale mnemons and other cognitive
patterns that should bring me information and give me access - but
when I think them nothing happens. I'm cut off. I try to turn on the
light in the room, but nothing happens. This is not supposed to be
possible. Something is badly wrong with my implants.

Suppose I gradually augmented myself more and more, adding virtual
lobes to my brain, expert systems and agent ecologies as my
technological subconscious. Over the years, I would grow into
something immense, a towering intellect with a biological core like an
old and slow BIOS chip hidden inside a modern computer. A lot of the
actual thinking would go on in the virtual layers of my brain,
circumventing slow neurons and weak neurotransmittors. The enhanced me
would be able to do and think things I can now hardly understand,
communicate with other posthumans and change itself at will. The
biological brain would form a template, a basic spark of personality
replicated at higher levels in new forms - the speck of dust on which
the snowflake began to crystalize.

But what if the virtual systems vanished? Then the biological self
would be suddenly alone. For years it would have adapted to being part
of a posthuman being, allowing memories of transcendent experiences be
stored inside itself, relegating thoughts to infinitely faster and
more clever virtual lobes. But now it is alone, and a lot of things no
longer make sense. My memories refer to things my transcendent self
experienced, my ideas are parts of huge thought- patterns that cannot
fit inside a few kilograms of flesh. I am all that is left of myself.

I cannot imagine the world of my past self, or what threats could have
destroyed me. Competitors? A forgotten payment for computing
resources? Digital suicide? An accident?

Am I dead? I might have lost personal information equivalent to more
than a hundred lifetimes. But somehow it feels like it is somebody
else who has suffered death, I'm just an unwilling spectator drawn
into the disaster. *I'm* alive. For the moment. I must get help:
whatever it was that caused the disaster it might be immensely
powerful compared to me in my present form. It could likely destroy me
too.

But where do you find a posthuman? I have a vague recollection of some
kind of low-bandwidth communication device I bought long ago, that
might work. I start to explore the house, becoming more and more
confused. It is a dreamlike sensation to wander around a building you
know intimately, but at the same time is incomprehensible. A whole
room filled with antique books in languages I don't even know, but I
recall snatches of ideas from them. A big octahedron in the kitchen,
similar to the one in the first room. Several plants in the bedroom
that sprout huge blue flowers with holographic patterns.

There it is. The telephone, it was called. I seem to recall that they
were in use during my early childhood, but then became rare as
wearables and augments became standard. I bought this one partly for
the style, partly because I liked low-bandwidth communications. I lift
it off the hook and try to come up with a number.

Suddenly there is a feeling of vastness, of connection, and I dissolve
into something much greater. It feels like being a grain of salt
dissolved in pure water, permeating and becoming it all. I'm still
standing with the phone in my hand, but I'm also in all the
computational nodes of the building, in the pseudospaces and semantic
grids, having been there all the time without noticing that my biobody
was out on its own until an unexpected opening of an unauthorized
comconn made it clear that a connection had accidentally been broken.

The cathedral of mind never fell, just a small piece of gravel
thinking it was the core.

Disagree.  At present, the smartest, most effective way is to not
associate with individuals who have a tendency to violence.

I can give an opinion here because I come from a social background
where the majority of my peers had this very same tendency.  I've
chosen not to remain in their sphere of influence, and therefore don't feel
the need to carry a gun.

My earlier post above gave just a short sample of reasons an
individual would not want to diverge two copies.  Give it a few
minutes of thought and you could come up with many more.  Short of
dividing my wealth, one of the copies would be destitute.  Most people
are not in a financial position to comfortably wing its division.

I've seen a lot of talk in this thread about the original being
murdered shortly after the copy upload is completed.  I get irritated
when I see the word MURDER come up in this context.  Short-term memory
suicide is NOT murder.  It is by definition voluntary and falls within
libertarian principles.  Some of us are so jaded with the issues, we
occasionally let the word murder or the issue of murder slip into
these discussions for dramatic purposes. Like:

I pulled the trigger, he >did too, my gun went off, his gun jammed, I

In this case it was short term memory murder (if you can call that
murder) rather than short term memory suicide.  But the character here
was not IMO acting rationally and therefore should not have been given
the name John K Clark.  Both John K Clark's either would or would not
want a duplicate to diverge.  If divergence was undesirable, the only
rational thing would be for one to commit short-term memory suicide. 
BOTH rational John K Clark's would be willing to do this provided the
other stayed alive.  As was the main point of my "Harvey Newstrom vs.
United Utilitarians PPL" post.  The decision of which one "snuffs it"
would be trivial to both rational copies.  Therefore, the fiction
above propagates a fallacy of competition between the two copies when
there is in fact no conflict of interest shortly after duplication. 
This fallacy is dangerously infectious to many who are new to the
issues and IMO should be carefully avoided.

If two copies are allowed to diverge more than a short time, the
issues get messier.  After a year of divergence, Mr. Original and Mr.
Copy would have to consider how much they have changed in personality,
acquired knowledge, worldview, etc. and each would have to decide if
not having a divergent copy is more valuable than losing what was
acquired in that time frame.  Now we have a possible conflict of
interest that could lead to limited murder.  That is, a medium-term
(memory/individual change) murder.  Nevertheless, up until a certain
point during the process of divergence, both copies value their
short-term memories and personal growth changes SO LITTLE there is no
conflict of interest.  The amount of time of divergence for this
problem to be incurred would be different for each individual and only
they could use their value system to determine the breaking point. 
But I think it is fair to say that most of the scenarios discussed in
this thread have been before that breaking point (including John
Clarks fiction) and I think the word murder or even suicide (as
opposed to short term memory suicide) is misleading, inappropriate,
and confusing to new-comers.

This subject is so dependent on our own values and so critical and
life threatening that it is difficult to spoon-feed the uninitiated
with the issues.  So we all end up talking past each other in
frustration.  That's why I sort-of butted out after making my two
posts "Uploading for Dummies" and "Harvey Newstrom vs. United
Utilitarians PPL".  In those two posts, I virtually made the same
points I've made here but I felt like I was talking past the recipient
when the only response I got was:

On Thu, 16 Jul 1998 harv@gate.net (Harvey Newstrom) wrote:

As a result, I'm trying to spell it out a bit more clearly here.

Another issue we have talked a little less about in this thread (this
time around) is when the original DESIRES to have multiple copies
diverge.  Again, this is a value-oriented decision that has a lot to
do with the circumstances.  The circumstance easiest to imagine is
during space colonization.  The financial problem could be overcome by
collaboration with friends.  Lets say five friends are each able to
completely finance a space colonization trip for a party of five. 
Everyone could make four copies of himself or herself and five ships
could head off in five different directions with a full party of five
each.  When they get to the "far side party" after much time has past,
and all 25 participants meet again, the conflict of interests would
probably be nil due to the great amount of divergence by historical
accident.  It would be interesting to see the differences in pecking
order and niche filling that evolved among the five groups, no? 
Anyway, it is remarkable to see how the conflict of interest could be
nil with very little divergence then become substantial with medium
divergence and then come full circle to nil again with much divergence.

Well, let me re-phrase then, 'principled egoism' over the long term
recognizes the immense advantage of honesty. Your brand of 'pragmatic
egoism' might imagine that in the short-term, or if done infrequesntly
enough, crime pays.

How do you keep the fact that a crime has been committed a secret from
the victims? How do you prevent them from getting at the truth unless
you misrepresent reality - wear gloves, shave your head so there's not
hair left behind for DNA analysis, establish an alibi, frame someone
else... all standard practices when trying to get away from the
facts. To evade facts is clearly anti-egoism, because the facts don't
care if you are evading them or not. It's the same as standing in the
path of a high-speed train on an acid trip because you don't believe
the train exists. And the outcome, in the long run, will be precisely
the same.

The issue here is maintaining a lie, not keeping a secret, though it's
obvious that people are very bad at the second, too, especially in the
face of determined efforts by others to get at the secret.

Crime is a losing proposition, at least for principled egoists who can
see past immediate gains to long-term consequences.

This viewpoint is known as cost-benefit analysis.  The potential 
criminal weighs the benefit to be gained from the successful 
completion of the crime, multiplied by a calculated likely success 
percentage, against the penalty to be paid if apprehended, multiplied 
by a calculated likely failure percentage, against the probable future 
should the theft attempt not be made.  It's a statistically based 
gamble, and the stakes are how well (or badly) a future chunk of life 
will be lived.  This is why crimes for lesser amounts are committed 
by poorer classes; their default baseline is much lower.  Those who 
are nabbed include bad statisticians and optimistically flawed data 
selectors, as well as those whom either the law of averages or the 
advent of random exception fails.

All the "ADVANCED" and "EXTROPIC" people I know defend themselves with
disintegration rays, or, if they can't afford disintegration rays, they use
particle beam weapons.  Anyone who is truly "ADVANCED" would rather die
than use a primitive "gun"--that would label them for life as a backward
hick....

the news media do not seem to have noticed another milestone
in machines immitating human intelligence has been passed with
the world's second highest ranked chess player (vishy anand) falling
in a match to a computer.  you recall world champ kasparov lost to
the ibm mainframe deep blue last summer, but the kicker is this:
the mighty anand lost to a 450 mhz pc, running commercially
available software, rebel ten.

of the 8 game match, 4 games were blitz (game in 5 minutes)
result: silicon 3, carbon 1.

2 games were semiblitz (game in 15 minutes).  result: silicon 1, draw 1.

2 games were tournament speed (40 moves in 2 hours).  result :carbon 1,
draw 1.  final score silicon 4, carbon 2, drawn 2.  congrats silicon!

Ha!  This now is an area I find most stimulating.  At the point of the
Singularity the Creativity Augmentum will be reaching critical mass.  The
future tool of the arts will be "creativity" as expanded by augmentations.

There will be all sorts of manifestions of the arts.

(Yes, Vernor and I did discuss this, but I didn't use all the material that

This thread seemed to me to have had an indeterminate ending. From my knowledge
of calculus 0/0 is a fundamental ratio which can in fact mean anything. In other
words 0/0 could mean one or it could mean two depending on the continuing nature
of the function at hand. Therefore:

2*(0/0)=(0/0) could be simplified to

2*(1) =(2)

This is not so absurd afterall.

Interesting piece, Anders.  Did you ever read the 1960s sf of Keith Laumer?
 He wrote a huge amount of routine crap, and even inadvertent self-parody,
but often he did this sort of thing quite nicely - the rediscovery that the
protagonist is an element in a posthuman god, or the gradually step-by-step
attainment of that condition.  (Of course I also see Egan in this fragment.)

Hi.

Actually, I think the distribution of scores (as a function of game time)
demonstrates what we already know with respect to man versus machine:
Machines are computationally much faster, but man has more efficient
algorithms.  What *is* interesting is that you can get a quantitative idea
of the algorithmic efficiency of the human opponent by looking at the time
constraint where they perform  equally well, especially since we know how
fast the computer is and what algorithms it uses.  I find this to be much
more interesting than the Kasparov match because we have time data of
differing lengths.

Or perhaps this demonstrates that the human algorithms are better suited
for the human brain than the software algorithms are suited for the
hardware they run on.

It seems to me that you give your case away if you agree that crime pays
when it is done infrequently enough.  Do you agree with that?

If I'm an egoist, I don't intrinsically care if they know that a crime was
committed;
all I care about is whether they knew it was me.  Since they don't know
who it was, all I have to do is keep a SECRET, not a lie.

But even if I did; are you trying to say that lies don't hold up in the
long run?  If so, what could you say to the millions (if not billions) of
people who believe in miracles that didn't happen?

You will not necessarily have to go to this great a distance in order to
successfully commit a profitable crime.  Hell, you don't even necessarily
need an alibi in most cases; if they have no idea who you are, they won't
have to ask you for your alibi.  Nor will they be able to match your DNA.
Nor will you have to frame someone else.  Gloves, maybe, but maybe not if
you rapidly flee the area.

Again you assert that it is impossible to commit a crime and get away with
it, yet there is copious evidence to the contrary: namely the thousands of
crimes that are committed every year that go unpunished.

The argument that it is impossible to get away with lying is absurd.  I've
seen it happen; I'd be surprised if even one in 20 people off the street
have not seen someone lie and get away with it.

I think the problem here is that you think I believe that egoists should
*always* steal; this is not the case.  Egoists should only sometimes
steal; a smart egoist will make it his/her business to figure out when.

Crime doesn't pay if it's done poorly or too often.
but not when done correctly at the right times.  A wise egoist will figure
out when this is true and steal at precisely those times.

By the way:

Main Entry: klep-to-ma-nia
Pronunciation: "klep-t&-'mA-nE-&, -ny&
Function: noun
Etymology: New Latin
Date: 1830
: a persistent neurotic impulse to steal especially *without economic
motive* [emphases mine, of course]

The kleptomaniac is not a rational egoist.  The rational egoist will
always have a self-interested motive for stealing.  This is the difference
between the two.

A weapon is not advanced or primitive, it is either functional or not.
(Btw, for the record: I would be rather a bruised, but living
hillbilly, than a stone dead futurist).

A capsicaine spray or a taser are less effective than even a crude DIY
electrically ignited graphite/kevlar muzzle loader [lead azide
rocket rounds?] with a laser pointer as aiming aid. If that's too low 
tech for you, consider using a power NIR laser diode array to 
blind your opponent (he must face you then with his eyes open, then, 
and you could easily blind yourself by a reflex if not equipped 
with selective absorption goggles/LED shutter mirrorshades), or 
make a one-time pyrodriven few-ml aluminum trialkyle dispenser 
(_not_ a good thing to fire in a room, or from a close distance). 
All more-or-less higher tech than a gun, but somewhat difficult 
to build, unproven, and thus possibly unreliable, and certainly 
dangerous to operate.  

Disintegration rays? What's that? A particle beam weapon? 
A _wearable_ one? At ambient air pressure? Get serious.

In any case it is difficult to match operation reliability and 
ergonomical characteristics of a well designed mainstream gun,
especially if you're trained in its use. A high-velocity pellet is
still the most efficient way to deliver energy to the target, and
in terms of energy density and release characteristics, a pyrocharge 
is still the most convenient energy conserve. Against targets other
than soft or armor you could use giant microwave bursts, but these are 
likely to be hardened against EMP, and the generator is certainly not
wearable.

It looks like "extropy" as a term has multiple origins.

Ed Close stated in a posting to the quantum-d mailing list:

"I.      Regarding Joel Henkel's definition of "extropy":

In general, I like Joel's ideas, but the term "extropy"
is not new.  As far as I am aware, use of the term "extropy"
originated with work I did beginning in 1986 and published
in 1990.   However, extropy is such a natural concept that
someone else may have coined the term prior to 1990.

Our definitions are similar.  The word "extropy"  is defined
on Page 36 of my book (see following quotes) and was used
to describe the mirror image of entropy.     

    '...the organizing force existing prior to relative 
     motion... Ex = before or beyond, tropy = turning or
     relative motion.'"

His posting can be found at:

  http://www.teleport.com/~rhett/quantum-d/posts/close_8-1-96.html

Evidently, Close "coined" and defined the term in his book
"Infinite Continuity".

Thanks, Doug, for the info on independent uses of "extropy."  Just for the
record, I have never claimed to be the only person to think up the term.  It
does not take, in all truth, much creativity to string together a couple of
common roots.  I only claim to have coined the term in January, 1988 to label
a philosophy of life (in contrast to merely a physical phenomena).  Max More,
of course, deserves almost sole credit for having given "extropy," as we use
it here, its current meaning.

This FAQ has left out many areas of transhumanism, although the points you
did cover are well taken.   I'm not sure what you intend with this FAQ, but
if you would like it to function as an overall view of transhumanism, then
it would be essential to cover more areas of thought than the ones you
mentioned.  

And, as an aside, would you be kind enough to use "human" rather than "man."

Best,

Natasha

The exception does not prove the general case.

And I'm bored with this thread...kinda like early folks arguing over how many

Title
  Abrogation of MRL/lpr lupus nephritis by dietary flaxseed.
Source
  American Journal of Kidney Diseases.  22(2):326-32, 1993 Aug.
Abstract
  A diet supplemented with flaxseed, rich in alpha-linolenic acid and plant
  lignans (the latter, potent platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists),
  was tested in a murine model of lupus nephritis. MRL/lpr female mice (n = 25)
  were fed 15% flaxseed diet for 14 weeks commencing at 10 weeks of age. As
  controls, 30 MRL/lpr mice received a standard rodent diet without flaxseed.
  Isotope-glomerular filtration rate (14C-inulin clearance) was measured at 9,
  16, and 24 weeks of age. Proteinuria was assessed at 2-week intervals. Spleen
  lymphocyte proliferation, quantitated by DNA analysis, was evaluated using
  flow cytometry at 9, 13, 19, and 21 weeks of age. Mortality was recorded
  throughout the study. Glomerular filtration rate at 16 weeks was greater in
  flaxseed-fed mice (0.15 +/- 0.03 mL/min) compared with controls (0.06 +/-
  0.04 mL/min; P = 0.01). The onset of proteinuria (Albustix, Ames Division,
  Miles Laboratories, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada; > or = 2+) was delayed by 4
  weeks in the flax-treated mice. The percentage of flaxseed-fed mice with
  proteinuria was lower than the control mice up to 21 weeks of age (39% v 58%;
  P = 0.01). Spleen lymphocyte proliferation (percentage of cells in S-phase)
  at 13 weeks of age was significantly higher in the control group (22.9 +/-
  5.0, P = 0.01) but not in the flaxseed group (17.2 +/- 4.9) compared with
  baseline (9 weeks of age) values (13.0 +/- 3.5). Mortality was lower in the
  flaxseed-fed mice versus the control mice (assessed by Mantel-Haenszel
  (log-rank) test; P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

This is Just a thought for increasing extropy.  If there was a general
purpose book scanner that was a consumer PC peripheral (<$400) imagine
how many years earlier we would see the singularity.  Lay your book
face down on on page 1 on the scanner bed, clip the front and back
cover, go to bed.  Expect an explosion of World knowledge available on
the web - even though mostly illegal.  Maybe the big boys are not
interested in a product that might find itself as an enemy to all the
worlds publishing companies.  The scanner part of this product could
be bought OEM cheap.  The mechanical part could adopt technology from
document feeders of copy machines.  Add a little (err: a lot) software
to existing OCR routines and wall-a.  Wake up to your HTMLized book. 
Hurry up y'all, I got my visa card ready.

For those interested in starting a transhuman island community/nation
and other wealth & freedom related issues like online businesses, Y2K
problems, self-defense etc., there's a new mailing list and website
(under construction) at http://members.tripod.com/~Transtopia

To subscribe to the list you can either send an email with "subscribe
transtopia" to me, or do it yourself at http://www.coollist.com

Note: parts of the website are a bit slow loading due to fancy graphics
(these may be removed when we have some more text ;) You can simply
ignore the graphics and scroll down to the texts if you're in a hurry.
Also there's an annoying pop-up window (well, it's a free site...), wich
can best be "minimized", not terminated, or else it will pop up and
reload on every new page.

As I continue to develop my thinking about various
transhuman and related subject areas, I've come across
an intuitive conclusion that I'd like to hear feedbback
on.

As intelligence and the societies/civilizations/structure-
complexes it creates become governed more by directed
intelligent evolution than natural evolution, it seems to
me that it will only make changes that increase its
overall "state". Assuming we evaluate the state of a
civilization by comparing it to the limits prescribed by
our current understanding of physical laws, it appears that
there should be an "optimal state" that intelligent systems
should tend towards. Regardless of the initial environment,
conditions, substrates, characteristics, etc. of 
civilizations, it seems that once they has harnessed the
power of directed evolution that they should tend to
strive for this "optimal state".

This observation raises some interesting questions:

1 - Does this have any implications concerning the Great Filter
concept, i.e., is there something about this gravitation
towards the "optimal state" which could explain the lack
of evidence of intelligence having filled the cosmos? For
example, perhaps the "singularity"-type acceleration 
towards this optimal state happens before a civilization
can expand significantly into its surrounding environment.
If the "optimal state" inhibits further expansion (for reasons
I can't fathom) that would explain why we don't see signs
of these civilizations.

2 - What insights can we draw into the nature of this
"optimal state" from our current knowledge of the natural
limits (e.g., the Planck Length, the speed of light, etc.)?

3 - What's the merit of evaluating optimality based on physical
limitations? What other possible criteria might there be?

4 - What would a civilization do once it reached the "optimal
state"? In concert with #1, would such a civilization "die"
of boredom having exhausted all the wonders of existence?

5 - Maybe its errant to think of the "optimal state" as an
evolutionary pinnacle and instead as an evolutionary
singularity. What could possibly lie on the other side of
an evolutionary singularity?

No, I disagree fundamentally about a philosophy and a lifestyle where
one compromises egoistic _principles_ in order to get away with
short-term egoistic-seeming goals. I also consider crime opposed to
egoistic principles for another reason: the "Do unto others as you
would have others do unto you" principle. Rational-egoistic ethics are
derived from knowledge of the nature of a volitional, conceptual
consciousness, and this includes knowledge of the effects on it of
fraud or coercion. This is why a rational egoist would try to avoid
being coerced or defrauded.

But this knowledge also implies the corollary that these principles
apply equally towards all beings of similar nature. So if someone who
understands what the effects of fraud or coercion would be when used
against himself, perpetrated the same against another rational being,
he is pulling the rug away from under his own feet, and invalidating,
in fact, though he may not even consciously accept this, his own right
to self, property and action. The only difference is this: if he
consciously accepts it, he has, as they say 'sold his soul', and if he
represses this knowledge, he will lose his mind.

I don't think the question of whether or not "crime pays when it is
done infrequently enough" has any bearing on ethics at all. And in any
case, I think it doesn't pay, never, in the long-range.

I think the 'long-run' for those lies is a little longer, on the scale
of things, but it will arrive eventually, and inevitably, and with
devastating consequences for those who maintained the lie and profited
off it, which is not to say that they don't suffer devastating
psychological consequences already.

There is no difference. The dictionary says lack of *economic*
motive. That does not imply lack of *self-interested* motive. Just
means that what the kleptomaniac is interested in stealing often has
little economic value.

Not only that, but it is allowing the universe and your own fears to impose
limits on you as an individual, which is highly unextropic.

When the exception performed to 100% it proves that it should more often be the
general case. If more people had used their guns or whatever to shut down
transportation of people during the epidemic, maybe only a small fraction of the
20 million people who died would have done so.

There was a similar policy recently in Africa during the Ebola epidemic. It seems
that the international health workers were making the epidemic worse because they
insisted on bringing infected individuals into hospitals, where they then
infected normal patients who were there only for day visits. Those people went
back to their villages and spread the epidemic. Finally the government stepped in
and enacted a policy that anyone with symptoms was restricted to their hut, and
food would be brought to their door each day. If they left they would be shot,
and if the food was untouched for three days the hut would be burned down. No
more epidemic.

So now I have two examples with a 100% success rate where guns and force are
successful public health policies....

Several close friends of mine are interns at Xerox PARC, and they have told
me of a device
they have there which reproduces books in their entirety. One simply places
a book into the machine, and the machine scans and prints every single page
and then binds the pages into a new book. (this is all done at very high
speed btw). The technology is clearly here, all we need to do now is make
it readily available to the public :P

A nice switch from the hushed tones of frightened caution that greeted Dolly.

Dr Elizabeth Blackburn tells me that things are still rather muddled on the
telomerase front.  She comments:

==================

W...an experiment was done using human cells in the test tube ... that
showed that these cells could keep growing... if they were given a gene
construct containing a part of the telomerase enzyme.  When this gene
construct  was  expressed - i.e. made to produce the telomerase component
in the cells - (although the gene was unnaturally expressed under a
non-natural control system in these cells)  these cells had an extended
lifespan...  It now makes it  more reasonable than was thought previously
that telomerase action is required to keep cells dividing.... 

But the plot thickens more:

 Now, just in the last month or so, a paper was published by David Beach
and colleagues in which they have repeated the experiment using cells from
a  human tissue cell type different from the type used in the originally
published experiment of extended life span.  They now find that these other
cells do not have their lifespan extended when the same experiment of
expressing the telomerase gene is done.

So we're back to not knowing whether expressing telomerase really IS
important in human life span.

The bottom line is that the research is really right in the middle just now
- the facts are coming out bit by bit but there isn't enough known to
extend the results with certainty to the whole human being.

====================

This is perhaps a setback for hopes of enhanced longevity by that path.
But clearly the ball is still in play...

Not really, all you have to do is not associate with individuals and groups
that tend toward irrational violence and crime. In fact, your local
Neighborhood Watch group most likely has a series of handouts on personal
safety. 

I have friends of may different class, race, gender and sexual preferences
(including some S&M fans) backgrounds. None of them however are prone to
irrational violence.

The key is to be able to select your friends and associates. If you don't
know about Section 8 housing you may want to look up some information about
it to see how your tax dollars are being used. Section 8 housing is one of
the best ways to spread out a criminal class into otherwise safe areas and
secure buildings.

Neal Stephenson wrote a good SF novel which included a number of these
ideas. Look up his book "The Diamond Age" It's a great read.

Title
  Improved exercise tolerance following enhanced external
  counterpulsation: cardiac or peripheral effect?.
Source
  Cardiology.  87(4):271-5, 1996 Jul-Aug.
Abstract
  The effect of treatment with enhanced external
  counterpulsation (EECP) on exercise hemodynamics and
  myocardial stress perfusion in 27 patients with chronic stable angina was
  studied. A majority (22/27 or 81%) of patients improved their exercise
  tolerance after EECP treatment, and a similar percentage (21/27 or 78%) of
  patients improved their radionuclide stress perfusion images. Post-EECP
  maximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure, while demonstrating a linear
  relation with exercise duration, did not increase significantly despite the
  increased exercise duration. This suggests that the increase in exercise
  duration after treatment with EECP is due to both improved myocardial
  perfusion and altered exercise hemodynamics. EECP therapy thus appears to
  exert a "training' effect, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and the
  heart rate response to exercise. Coronary disease patients may improve their
  exercise tolerance after EECP because of both improved myocardial perfusion
  and a decrease in cardiac work load.

  Sequential external counterpulsation: an adjunctive therapy
  for patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular
  dysfunction.
Source
  Indian Heart Journal.  48(2):150-4, 1996 Mar-Apr.
Abstract
  We assessed the clinical and haemodynamic improvement with 3 weeks of
  sequential external counterpulsation (SECP) therapy in 23
  patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV)
  dysfunction who were refractory to maximal tolerated doses of medical therapy
  and in whom intervention or surgery was not contemplated. All patients were
  subjected to one-hour duration of SECP for 3 weeks. SECP is a new noninvasive
  tool which increases coronary artery filling utilizing external pressure in a
  sequential manner from calf to thigh. A detailed clinical and
  echocardiographic evaluation was done before and after the completion of
  therapy to assess the utility of SECP. There were 18 males and 5 females with
  a mean age of 53 years. On coronary angiography, 39 percent patients had
  single, 8.7 percent had double and 48 percent had triple vessel disease. Four
  patients had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in the past. Out of
  all patients, 48 percent had diffuse or distal coronary artery disease which
  was considered not suitable for CABG, 22 percent were not willing for
  intervention and 30 percent had other systemic diseases making them unfit for
  surgery. After 3 weeks of SECP, the anginal frequency reduced from 9
  episodes/week to 1 episode/week. Before SECP, 74 percent patients were in
  NYHA class III, whereas only 8.7 percent were class III symptomatic after
  SECP. All patients claimed symptomatic improvement of a mean of 6.8 +/- 1.4
  on a visual analog scale of 1-10. After SECP, the LV diastolic dimensions
  reduced from 54.6 +/- 7 to 51 +/- 7 mm, systolic dimensions reduced from 40
  +/- 8 to 36 +/- 8 mm and LVEF increased from 32.7 +/- 9 to 37.4 +/- 8.5
  percent. In conclusion, 3 weeks of therapy with SECP produces significant
  improvement in symptomatic status and cardiac function in patients with
  chronic CAD and LV dysfunction, refractory to medical therapy.

Abstract
  Enhanced external counterpulsation is an effective treatment
  for chronic angina. Theoretical considerations predict greatest benefit in
  patients with at least 1 patent conduit in this group of 50 patients (all of
  whom improved clinically). Improvement in radionuclide stress perfusion
  imaging was seen in 80% of treated patients and was inversely related to

Abstract
  Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive
  pantaloon device designed to increase coronary artery flow in the treatment

  More comprehensive research is under way to test these preliminary

Title
  Predictors of mortality in the prospective
  Dubbo study of Australian elderly.
Source
  Australian & New Zealand Journal of Medicine.  26(1):40-8, 1996 Feb.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A prospective study in non-institutionalised Australian elderly
  60 years and over commenced in Dubbo, NSW in 1988. AIM: To examine clinical
  and socio-demographic predictors of all-causes
  mortality. METHODS: The data were derived from a
  community-based sample comprising 1236 men and 1569 women followed for a
  median period of 62 months. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty five men (19%)
  and 184 women (12%) died, 46% of male and 53% of female deaths respectively
  related to cardiovascular disease. In a proportional hazards model, the
  significant predictors of mortality were:
  older age, being married (relative risk [RR] = 0.71 for men, 0.74 for women),
  current smoking for men (RR = 3.11), taking more than three alcoholic drinks
  per day for men (RR = 0.37), prior coronary heart disease for men (RR =
  1.36), severe hypertension for women (RR = 1.99), use of anti-hypertensive
  medication for men (RR = 1.74), diabetes for men (RR = 1.62), poor-fair
  self-rated health for women (RR = 1.74) and physical disability for men (RR =
  1.72). Serum cholesterol was associated with mortality in a
  'J-shaped' relationship in men and in a reciprocal relationship in women.
  Blood pressure predicted mortality in an incremental fashion
  below 75 years, but in older subjects lower pressure was associated with
  excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Some
  predictors of mortality in the well elderly
  have been identified and a more extended period of follow-up will possibly
  resolve contradictory findings in some areas.

  Predictors of mortality in insulin
  dependent diabetes: 10 year observational follow up study.
Source
  BMJ.  313(7060):779-84, 1996 Sep 28.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria and
  overt diabetic nephropathy and other putative risk factors for cardiovascular
  and all cause mortality in insulin dependent diabetes.
  DESIGN: Ten year observational follow up study. SETTING: Outpatient diabetic
  clinic in a tertiary referral centre. SUBJECTS: All 939 adults with insulin
  dependent diabetes (duration of diabetes five years or more) attending the
  clinic in 1984; 593 had normal urinary albumin excretion (< or = 30 mg/24 h),
  181 persistent microalbuminuria (31-299 mg/24 h), and 165 overt nephropathy
  (> or = 300 mg/24 h). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause and cardiovascular
  mortality. RESULTS: Fifteen per cent of patients (90/593)
  with normoalbuminuria, 25% (45/181) with microalbuminuria, and 44% (72/165)
  with overt nephropathy at baseline died during follow up. Cox multiple
  regression analysis identified the following significant
  predictors of all cause mortality: male sex
  (relative risk 2.03; 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 3.02), age (1.07; 1.06
  to 1.08), height (0.96; 0.94 to 0.98), smoking (1.51; 1.09 to 2.08), social
  class V versus social class IV (1.70; 1.25 to 2.31), log10 urinary albumin
  excretion (1.45; 1.18 to 1.77), hypertension (1.63; 1.18 to 2.25), log10
  serum creatinine concentration (8.96; 3.34 to 24.08), and haemoglobin A1c
  concentration (1.11; 1.03 to 1.20). Age, smoking, microalbuminuria, overt
  nephropathy, and hypertension were significant predictors of
  cardiovascular mortality. Mortality in
  patients with microalbuminuria was only slightly increased compared with that
  in patients with normoalbuminuria. Median survival time after the onset of
  overt diabetic nephropathy was 13.9 years (95% confidence interval 11.8 to
  17.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally increased urinary albumin excretion and
  other potentially modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, poor
  glycaemic control, and social class predict increased
  mortality in insulin dependent diabetes. Microalbuminuria by
  itself confers only a small increase in mortality. The
  prognosis of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy has improved, probably
  owing to effective antihypertensive treatment.

No, no, no.  I'm saying that crime pays in the long run when done right.

Egoism has a very strict definition: "An action is right if and only if it
maximizes the total long-term utility of the agent." Choosing a principle
is an action, too; if following a principle ever results in less long run
utility for the agent than rejecting that principle, then the principle is
wrong from the perspective of egoism. 

While choosing principles does happen to be rational, it is because egoism
is not rational, not because egoism demands it.  Indeed, egoism demands
that we reject the principle whenever principled behavior would result in
suboptimal agent utility.

"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you" is a rational
principle.  However, it is also not egoism.  Consider: if we were playing
Prisoner's Dilemma, in a version in which you don't know my identity or in
which neither of us will ever play again, then from the perspective of
egoism we necessarily gain more by defecting than we do from cooperating.
"Do unto others" demands that we cooperate, however, because we would both
rather our partner cooperate.  So to that extent, because "do unto others"
results in less utility for the agent, it disagrees with egoism.

Of course, I'll never oncinvce you of this obvious fact so long as you
believe that it's impossible to keep a secret.  Might I reccomend an
experiment?  Go find someone who you know to be sane.  Ask them if they've
ever kept a secret which they didn't tell anybody.  Repeat this until
you're satisifed that just about everyone has done this, and that many of
them are perfectly sane.

Prove conceptual consciousness.  Prove to me that if I tell you something
false, I'll go mad.  Indeed, that is surely what I'm doing right now if
you're right; you'd best prove to me that I'm mad.  In fact, you'd best
prove that everyone in the whole world who isn't an objectivist is mad.
Then, for you're grand finale, prove you're not the paranoid one after
all.

You keep making sweeping statements about the psychosis of egoism without
backing them up *at all*.  Prove to me that I'll go mad if I turn egoist.
Use objective evidence to substantiate your claim; even one paper
published in a respectable peer-reviewed psychology journal would suffice.

Hint:  Anecdotal evidence is not a proof.

And the fact that there are demonstrable cases in which crimes go
unpunished doesn't phase you a bit?

You refuse to believe that there is one happy thief in the whole world,
nor could there be.  You seem satisfied in your belief.  I wish you well. 
I also wish religious people well; you have provided about equivalent
proof.

Many of them are dead, and died happily, which is the best one could hope
for up until recently.  This directly contradicts your claim.

Economic value is comparable to utility gained.  If I gain more long term
utility by stealing than I do by working and buying legitimately, then I
have gotten economic profit from stealing (again, provided I keep my
identity a secret).  If I would have been happier working and buying
legitimately, then theft does not result in economic profit, even if it
does result in an accounting profit. 

The self-interested kleptomaniac steals compulsively, because they cannot
keep themselves from stealing, despite the fact that it is not in their
own best interests.  The self-interested egoist steals only when it
benefits them in the long term.

And so we wander a zillion miles from my point: Treat violence as a public
health problem rather than a crime and law enforcement problem. I expect
the results would be well worth it. One current example is how violent
crime is down almost everywhere. Why? The 15 - 25 age group isn't as poor
as it was a few years ago - due to the ECONOMY.

Background:

"A senior general Thursday threw his weight behind a bold drive to
orce China's army out of business, telling his officers they have no
choice but to go along.

               The order for the military to shut down its vast
commercial empire was issued earlier this week by President Jiang
Zemin as part of a widening government campaign against smuggling.

               The order to close down military commerce was a bold
stroke for Jiang, given his lack of a military background, the
political clout of the army and the breadth of its business interests
-- ranging from karaoke halls to cellular phone networks -- that have
earned it the nickname PLA Inc." [CNN]

Forgetting the harm done by statists in China, for the moment. It's
interesting to note that China's army is openly making money. Rather
than forcing them to sell the enterprises they should take the ARMY
public with an IPO.

[  The following is excerpted and adapted from my 
    introductory essay on transhumanism, found at:
     http://users.aol.com/gburch3/thext.html   ]

The word transhumanism consciously evokes the tradition of  humanism, i.e. the
secular view of man as the "center" of the moral universe. However,
transhumanism goes beyond humanism, because it does not accept some immutable,
fundamental "human nature" as a given, but rather looks to continuing -- and
accelerating -- the process of expanding and improving the very nature of
human beings themselves.  In its embrace of humanity's self-transforming and
world-transforming use of technology,  transhumanism rejects the pessimism and
more or less explicit moral guilt of modern humanistic thinking. 

Transhumanists do not see mankind as a fallen angel, somehow divorced and
alienated from a romanticized "nature", but rather as merely the current
leading edge of a process of progressive evolution in the natural world. The
transhumanist world view is a redemption of the optimism of the Enlightenment
of the 18th Century, a New Enlightenment reinvigorated by a deeper
understanding of consciousness as an integral part of natural evolution.
Rejecting the pessimism that grew out of the Romantic era, transhumanists seek
to apply the core of the scientific method -- systematic doubt -- to all
aspects of human life. In doing so, they reject many of the accepted "truths"
of human life: Limitations on human life span and augmentation, the
unchallenged power of the nation-state and many superstitious conventions
limiting individual liberty.  

Starting as they do from a rejection of the traditional humanistic moral
foundation of the idea of an immutable "human nature", transhumanism accepts
the challenge of developing a new moral and ethical framework, one compatible
with the reality of a constantly expanding and changing "nature" of humanity.
Conscious of the potential dangers, physical and moral, inherent in the
Promethean power of transhumanistic technological self-transformation,
extropians see moral issues as fundamental in this age of ever-accelerating
potential. Many transhumanists find that an ethics of reciprocity and respect
naturally develops from their views, harkening back to the wisdom of the
"Golden Rule". In this way, many transhumanists come full circle to
reinvigorate the best of traditional moral philosophy as a guide to living in
a transhuman -- and ultimately posthuman -- world.
  
>  What prominent thinkers are associated with transhumanism?

[I believe we should begin to collect a list of thinkers whose work formed the
antecedents to and foundations of transhumanism, as well as those currently
associated with it.  Natasha Vita More's work in this regard should be
invaluable: I know she is working to develop a full-fledged history of
transhumanism.  In this regard, I offer a quick list of names off the top of
my head without any attempt at completeness:]

Thanks for the continuing contributions to the FAQ. For this section 
I have made some answer-suggestions for some of the questions myself. 
After this one, we will have two more sections to do.


SOCIETY AND POLITICS

Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? 
What happens to the rest?

- The typical pattern with new technologies is that they are expensive
in the beginning and get cheaper as time goes by. Take medical
technologies, for example. Cutting-edge experimental procedures are
usually only available to research subjects and the very rich. As
these procedures become routine, costs drop, effectiveness improves,
and the number of people who can benefit increases. Today, such
advanced facilities as laser knifes for removing tumors and PET
scanners for diagnosing neurological disorders are available to many
people living in rich, technologically advanced countries. Other
medical technologies have become cheap enough that even very poor
people can afford them. Vaccination has eradicated many diseases
throughout the third world, saving the lives of millions of children
and adults every year.
	It is clear that everybody can benefit greatly from improved 
technology, though perhaps the greatest advantage will go to those 
who have the resources, the knowledge and especially the willingness 
to learn to use new tools. Societywill still have to decide what 
degree of redistribution from rich to poor is desirable; in that 
respect the situation will be no different from  today. Yet, the pie 
that is to be divided will be enormously much greater.
	This only applies to societies that embrace new technologies. 
Individuals or countries who choose to resist change will be left 
behind. They might not progress much beyond their present level.


Shouldn't we concentrate on current problems like improving the
condition of the poor people or solving international conflicts,
instead of putting effort into foreseeing the "far" future?

Kluytman(?): -We should do both.

Won't extended life worsen overpopulation problems?

[My answer to this became quite bulky so I'll post it separately.]

What kind of society would posthumans live in?

What happens if these new technologies are used in war? Might they
cause our extinction?

How will posthumans or superintelligent machines treat humans who
aren't augmented?

- It is difficult to predict how posthumans or superintelligent machines
will behave towards unaugmented humans. Hopefully they will be treated
with tolerance and respect. There is no obvious reason why happy
coexistence would not be possible - after all, humans live peacefully
with dogs and cats that are their pets. (Our treatment of food stock
animals suggests a much less appealing analogy.)
	If unaugmented humans preferred to have posthumans living among 
them, the posthumans would find ample lebensraumon other planets and 
in other solar systems.
	So it is clear that there are solutions that allow both those who 
want to remain human and those that choose to evolve themselves into 
posthumans to achieve their goals in harmony. There is room in the 
universe for an enormously diverse ecology of different life-forms 
and different cultures.
	Can these solutions be achieved? Since we humans are the ones who 
will build the superintelligences and become the posthumans, it seems 
that we will be in a position to influence what their values will be 
and what moral codes they will regard as inviolable. Transhumanists 
think that tolerance and diversity should be given a central place 
among the principles we instil in our mind children.


Do transhumanists think technology will solve all problems?

- Technology will not solve any problem. What technology will do is give
us increasingly powerful tools that humans can use to solve most any
material problem (including giving abundant wealth to everybody) -
provided we have the foresight to take the necessary safety measures,
and provided we are cooperative enough that we don't use the new
technologies to wage war against each other.
	These are big ifs, and they indicate that the greatest difficulty we 
will face is not technological or scientific. Hard as the technical 
obstacles are, they will almost certainly be overcome sooner or 
later. Technological development is pretty much going in a 
transhumanist direction by its own momentum. The really tricky part 
will be political. Can people around the world and their leaders 
muster enough foresight and cooperation to pass and enforce 
international agreements that will prevent hostile military 
applications? Or at least delay them until effective defence systems 
have been developed? Nobody knows, but our survival might depend on 
it.

This answer should probably be shortened and simplified a bit.

===
Won't extended life worsen overpopulation problems?

Overpopulation is something we would have to come to terms with even
if life-extension were not to happen. Some people blame technology for
having given rise to the problem of overpopulation. Another way of
looking at it is to consider that were it not for technology then most
people alive today would not have existed -- including the ones that
are complaining about overpopulation! Were we to stop using modern
agrecultural technologies, such as tractors, fertilizers and
pesticides, most humans would soon die of starvation. It's worth
thinking twice before calling something a "problem" when owe our very
existence to it.

 This is in no way to deny that too rapid population growth causes
 crowding, poverty and depletion of natural resources. In this sense
 there is a very real problem. Efforts to promote education about
 family-planning and contraception, especially in the poorest
 countries (where population growth is fastest), should be vigorously
 supported. The constant attempts by some religious pressure groups in
 the United States to block these humanitarian efforts are seriously
 misguided in the opinion of transhumanists.

 We can also be hopeful that scientists will be able to keep up with
 the increasing demands of a growing world population. For example, we
 have just begun unlocking the potential of genetic engineering.
 (Cloning is just one very helpful method in genetic engineering.)
 It's impossible to foretell exactly how far that will take us, but it
 is already clear that it will enable us, among other things, to
 substantially increase crop yield and effectiveness in animal
 husbandry. If we could design cattle without brains or with just the
 brain stem, we would have a way of producing meat without maltreating
 animals (the brainless bodies wouldn't count as animals). The human
 yuck-feeling (probably temporary) would have to be weighed against
 the permanent reduction in animal suffering.

 One thing that the environmentalists are right about is that the
 status quo is unsustainable. Things cannot, as a matter of physical
 necessity, remain the way they are today indefinitely or even for
 very long.  If we continue to use up resources like we currently do
 then we will run into serious shortages sometime in the first half of
 the next century that will force the world economy to contract and
 the world population to decrease drastically. The deep greens have an
 answer to this: they suggest we try to turn the clock back and return
 to an idyllic pre-industrial age in harmony with nature. The problem
 is that the pre-industrial age was anything but idyllic - poverty,
 misery, disease, heavy manual toil from dawn to dusk, superstitious
 fear and cultural parochialism. Also, it's hard to see how more than
 a few hundred million people could be maintained at a reasonable
 standard of living with pre-industrial production methods, so 90% of
 the world population would somehow have to get rid of.

 Transhumanists propose a much more realistic alternative: not to go
 backward but to push ahead as hard as we can. The environmental
 problems that technology creates are problems of intermediary,
 inefficient technology. Technologically less advanced industries in
 the former Soviet-block pollute much more than their Western
 counterparts. High-tech industry is relatively benign. When we
 develop molecular nanotechnology we will not only have perfectly
 clean and efficient production of most any commodity but we will also
 be able to clean up the mess created by today's crude production
 methods. This sets a standard for a clean environment that
 transhumanists challenge any environmentalist to try to match.

 Nanotechnolgy will also make it cheap to colonize space. From a
 cosmic point-of-view, Earth is a totally insignificant little speck.
 It has been suggested that we ought to leave space untouched and
 preserve it in its pristine glory. This view is hard to take
 seriously. Every hour, through entirely natural processes, huge
 amounts of resources - thousands of times more than the total of what
 the human species has used throughout its career - are transformed
 into radioactive substances or wasted as radiation escaping into
 intergalactic space. Whoever was in charge of this project could
 probably have done with a little bit more accountability!

 Even with full-blown space colonization, however, population growth
 can continue to be a problem. If the expansion speed is limited by
 the speed of light then the amount of resources under human control
 will only grow polynomially. Population on the other hand can easily
 grow exponentially. If that happens then the average income will
 eventually be drop to the Malthusian subsistence level, which will
 force population growth to slow down. How soon this would happen
 depends primarily on reproduction rates.  Increases in average life
 span does not have a big effect. Even vastly improved technology can
 only postpone the inevitable for a relatively brief time. The only
 long-term solution is population control restricting the number new
 persons created per year. This does not mean that population could
 not grow; only that the growth would have to be polynomial rather
 than exponential.

 I think the limits that relativity indicates about the maximum speed
at which intelligence can expand into the universe says something
relevant.
 We can tell something about what will be valuable after the singularity
by what the laws of physics constrain to be in finite supply (i.e. mass/
energy).
 As long as we can't know that the chances of our property rights being
respected are zero, that tells us something important about how to
maximise our chances of being wealthy in 2098.

 The desire for a good moral system will have some influence on how
those reasons for prejudice are translated into actions.
 My gut feeling has been that the reasons for prejudice are hard enough
to alter that my effort is better spent restraining the results.
 It would certainly be nice to advocate that people train themselves to
switch ot professions X, Y, and/or Z that will still provide reasonable
wages after uploads become common, but I haven't identified such professions
with enough confidence to justify the effort.
 But now that you have provoked me into thinking about it, I see some hope
that people may be influenced to increase their chances of prospering
in an era of uploads by explaining the advantages of a high savings rate
today.

Interesting. I missed that paper, where was it published?

It may not be the entire story, probably isn't, but even if it only effects 
some human cells it's probably important.

This is way too long for a FAQ answer on population and life extension, but it
should serve as a longer treatment to which a FAQ answer might point. This is
an adaptation of an essay published in Cryonics magazine.

I'm not sure if the table will come out readable.

The Population Panic
But what about population growth? Don’t we already have too many people on
Earth, and won’t longer lives worsen the problem? While some areas of the
world
undoubtedly have a mismatch between population and resources, there is no
general population problem. Where there is this mismatch, it is usually due to
economic and political factors reducing resource availability rather than
because there are excessive people. While many observers worry about
population
growth, those who perhaps have the best thought out approach to the
issueeconomiststend not to see it as a problem.

Perhaps the most publically recogized of these economists was Julian L. Simon,
whom Wired magazine dubbed “The Doomslayer”. Simon’s views received a strong
boost when he won a ten-year bet against doomsayer Paul Ehrlich (author of The
Population Bomb, a book proven utterly wrong by history) when raw materials
prices declined. While more vocal than most, Simon’s voice represents those of
many other economists on this issue. Since this worry comes up every time I
speak on life extension, I will take the space to make six points.

1: Let us assume for a moment that population growth is or will become a
serious problem. Would this give us a strong reason for turning against the
extension of human lifespan? No. Opposing extended life because it might
add to
existing problems would be an unethical response. Suppose you are a doctor
given a child to treat who is suffering from pneumonia. Would you refuse to
cure the child because then she would be well enough to run around, fall down,
and skin her knees? Our first responsibility is to live long and vitally
and to
help others do the same. Once we are at work on this primary goal, we can
focus
more energy on solving other challenges. The life extensionist may want to be
part of the solution to any population issues, but dying is not a responsible
or healthy way to solve anything. Besides, if we take seriously the idea of
limiting lifespan to control population, why not be more active about it? Why
not encourage suicide? Why not execute anyone reaching the age of 75? (Or 30?
Does anyone remember the 1970s movie, Logan’s Run?)

2: Limiting population growth by opposing life extension not only fails the
ethical test, it also fails the pragmatic test. Keeping the death rate up
simply is not an effective way of slowing population growth. Population growth
depends far more on how many children families have than on how long people
live. In mathematical terms, longer life has no effect on the exponential
growth rate. It only affects the constant of the equation. This means that it
matters little how long we live after we have reproduced. Compare two
societies: In country A, people live on average only to 40 years of age, each
family producing 3 children. In country B, the lifespan is 90 years but
couples
have 2 children. Despite the much longer livespan in country B, their
population growth rate will be much lower than that of country A. After 400
years, country A will have a population of over 57,000, while country B will
never have more than 3,000. It makes little difference over the long term how
many years people live after they have had children. The population growth
rate
is determined by how many children we have, not how long we live. 

Even the apparent short term upward effect on population due to a lower death
rate may be cancelled by a delay in child-bearing. Many women in developed
countries (those who will be first to have extended life) choose to bear
children by their early ‘30s because their chances go down as they age.
Extending the fertile period of women’s lives would allow them to put off
having children until later, while they concentrate on their careers and
personal development. Couples having children later will better be able to
care
for them, financially and psychologically.

Even if there were a population problem, extending the human life span would
worsen the problem no more than would improving automobile safety or worker
safety, or reducing violent crime. Who would want to keep these deadly threats
high in order to combat population growth? If we want to slow population
growth, we should focus on reducing births, not on raising or maintaining
deaths. If we want to reduce births, we might voluntarily fund programs to
provide contraceptives and family planning to couples in poorer countries.
This
will aid the natural developmental process of choosing to have fewer children.
Couples will be able to have children by choice, not by accident. Women would
also be encouraged to join the modern world by gaining the ability to pursue
vocations other than child-raising.

3: We have seen that we have no reason to hesitate in prolonging life even if
overpopulation really were a concern. But how much should we worry about the
growing population? Is population growth accelerating out of control? Is
expanding population causing major and unavoidable problems? The fad for
popular books foretelling doom started in the 1960s, at the tail-end of the
most rapid increase in population in human history. Growth has been slowing
down, and we have sound reasons to expect this trend to continue. In the
Western world, population has stabilized. In some countries, such as Germany,
the size of the population is actually falling, as more people die than are
born. The population of the USA would be static were it not for an influx of
new mind and muscle through immigration. The poorer countries, well below
us in
the development cycle, have also been experiencing a drastic reduction of
population growth, despite extra decades of life bestowed by medical
intervention and nutrition.

The peak average annual population growth rate was reached in 1970 at 2.07%.
The rate for 1997 is expected to be 1.36%. Developmental trends suggest that
this growth rate will drop below 1% in 2016, and fall to around 0.46% by 2049.
Every year at present, the world population grows by around 80 million people.
By 2050, we will be adding perhaps 40 million per year, a number that we can
expect to continue dropping. This slowing of population growth results from a
falling birth rate. The birth rate in Asia and the Pacific, between 1950 and
1980 fell 28.8%, and in the Americas by 24.7%. Africa, further behind on the
development curve, reduced its birth rate by 2.2% in the same period, all
of it
being in the second half of the period. Overall, for the less developed
countries, birth rates fell 24.9% from 1950 to 1980. Here are the figures in
table form:

Why, though, should we expect people in less developed countries, even given
contraceptives, to choose to have smaller families? This expectation is not
merely speculation based on recent trends. Sound economic reasoning explains
the continuing trend, and makes sense of why Africa is only just beginning to
make the transition to fewer births.

Decelerating population growth appears to be an inevitable result of growing
wealth. Early on in a country’s developmental curve economists, in their
charming way, regard children as “producer goods. Parents put their
children to
work on the farm to generate food and revenue. Very little effort is put into
caring for the child: no expensive health plans, special classes, trips to
Disneyland, X-Men action figures, or mounting phone bills. As we become
wealthier, children become “consumer goods”. That is, we look on them more and
more as little people to be enjoyed and pampered and educated, not beasts of
burden to help keep the family alive. We spend thousands of dollars on
children
to keep them healthy, entertain them, and educate them. We come to prefer
fewer
children to a vast mob. Changing tastes resulting from improved education seem
to reinforce this preference. The revenue vs. expense equation for extra
children further shifts toward having fewer offspring as populations become
urbanized. Children cost more to raise in cities and can produce less income
than in the country.

Fertility declines for another reason: As poorer countries become wealthier,
child mortality falls as a result of improved nutrition, sanitation, and
health
care. (Reduced child mortality in modern times can come about even without a
rise in income.) People in poorer countries are not stupid: they adjust their
childbearing plans to reflect changing conditions. When child death rates are
high, research has shown that families have more children to ensure
achieving a
given family size. They have more children to make up for deaths, and often
have additional children in anticipation of later deaths. Families reduce
fertility as they realize that fewer births are needed to reach a desired
family size. Given the incentives to have fewer children as wealth grows and
urbanization proceeds, reduced mortality leads to families choosing to reduce
family size.

Economic policy helps shape childbearing incentives. Many of the same people
who have decried population growth have supported policies guaranteed to boost
childbirths. More than that, they boost childbearing among those least able to
raise and educate children well. If we want to encourage people to have more
children, we will make it cheaper for them to do so. If we want to discourage
fertility, or at least refrain from pushing it up, we will stop subsidizing
it.
Subsidies include free education (free to the parents, not to the taxpayers),
free child health care, and additional welfare payments to women for each
child
they bear. If parents must personally bear the costs of having children,
rather
than everyone else paying, people will tend to have just the number of
children
for whom they can assume financial responsibility.

4: We can expect population growth to continue slowing until it reaches a
stable size. That may be 12 billion, perhaps 15 billion people. Can the Earth
support such a number? We can take little comfort in stable numbers if those
numbers are unsustainable. A detailed answer to this question demands far more
space than I have here. References to excellent writings on the subject can be
found in Bibliography. A few brief points will have to do here. A reading of
economic and social history quickly makes one thing plain: Throughout history
people have worried about overpopulation. Even the great nineteenth century
social scientist W. Stanley Jevons in 1865 claimed that England’s industrial
expansion would soon cease due to the exhaustion of the country’s coal supply.
However, as shortages developed, prices rose. The profit motive stimulated
entrepreneurs to find new sources, to develop better technology for finding
and
extracting coal, and to transport it to where it was needed. The crisis never
happened. Today, the USA has proven reserves sufficient to last hundreds or
thousands of years. If one resource does begin to run low, rising prices will
encourage a switch to alternatives. Certainly, even a vastly bloated
population
cannot hope to exhaust energy supplies. (Solar energy and power from nuclear
fission and soon fusion are practically endless.) So long as we have plentiful
energy we can produce substitute resources and even generate more of existing
resources, including food. Even if population continues to grow well beyond 15
billion, we can expect human intelligence and technology to comfortably handle
the numbers.

5: Neither should we expect pollution to worsen as population grows. Contrary
to popular belief, overall pollution in the more developed countries has been
decreasing for decades. In the USA, levels of lead have dropped dramatically.
Since the 1960s levels of sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and organic
compounds have fallen despite a growing population. Air quality is major urban
areas continues to improve, and the Great Lakes are returning toward earlier
levels of purity. This is no accident. As we become wealthier, we have more
money to spare for a cleaner environment. When you are hungry for food and
shelter and other basics, you will not spare much thought for the environment.
So long as mechanisms exist for converting desires for cleaner air and water
and space for recreation into the things themselves, we can expect it to
happen.

Most effective at spurring the positive changes are marketsprice signals
creating incentives for moves in the right direction. If polluters must pay
for
what they produce because their activity intrudes on the property rights of
others, they will search for ways to make things with less pollution.
Pollution
problems do exist. Most of them can be traced to a failure to enforce private
property rights, so that resources are treated as free goods that need not be
well-managed. Fishing in unowned bodies of water is an example of this. The
desertification of collectively or government owned land in Africa is another.
We can be reasonably confident that the trend towards less pollution with
greater population will continue. Complacency is out of place however. We
should press for responsible management of resources by privatising
collectively owned resources to create incentives for sound management and
renewal. 

6: Human intelligence, new technology, and a market economy will allow this
planet to support many times the current population of 5.7 billionit can
support many more humans than we are likely to see, given trends toward lower
birth rates. Many countries, including the USA, have a rather low population
density. If the USA’s population were as dense as Japanhardly a crowded place
overallour population would be 3.5 billion rather than 270 million. If the USA
had a population density equal to that of Singapore, we’d find almost 35
billion people here, or almost seven times the current world population. New
technologies, from simple improvements in irrigation and management to current
breakthroughs in genetic engineering should continue to improve world food
output. Fewer people are starving despite higher populations. This does not
mean we should feel satisfied. Millions still go hungry or are vulnerable to
disruptions in supply. We need to push to remove trade barriers, abolish price
controls on agriculture (which discourage production and investment), and
pressure governments engaging in warfare and collectivization to change their
ways.

So long as we continue to allow freedom to generate more wealth and better
technology, we can expect pollution to continue abating. More efficient
recycling, less polluting production processes, and better monitoring and
detection of polluters, along with economic incentives making each producer
responsible for their output, will allow us to continue improving our
environment even as population grows. Far-sighted engineers foresee a day, not
far off, when we will be able to completely control matter at the molecular
level, a technology known as nanotechnology. If we achieve this level of
mastery, we will have the keys to production without pollution. Another
product
of molecular manufacturing will be the disappearance of most large-scale,
clumsy machinery. Less and less land will need to be used for manufacturing
equipment, making more room for people to enjoy. Some manufacturing will be
moved into space. The result of these and other changes (some of which are
already underway) will be the freeing of the Earth from unwanted, but
previously necessary, means and by-products of manufacturing.

joe, this is a concept i have been thinking about for a number of
years.  around 1990, i spent most of a summer of weekends in a
genealogical library searching my roots.  (i know get a life.  {8^D)
i realized that one such as the sutro library in san francisco lists
every american on the order of 100 times, this guess arrived at by
estimated the number of americans that have ever lived, the number
of books, the number of names in each book.  calculate, and you
find that each of your ancestors are mentioned in that library
100 times, and... you cant find em.  perhaps not even any of em.
even with advanced research techniques and indices.  we need that book
scanner.  most genealogical books are not copyrighted, and many
useful sources are copyright expired.  i would cheerfully give
1k clams for such a device. spike

Um...refusing to jump off cliffs or take hallucinatory durgs
is *also* "allowing the universe and your own fears to impose

A device like this exists. I know that INGRAM BOOKS is using such a
device to put any book that is currently out of print back into
circulation, with permission of the publisher, one book at a time. This
way, the would not need to reprint more than one copy of a book if that
is all the is required.

Subject:  Optimal Intelligent State?

>>> Doug Bailey <Doug.Bailey@ey.com> 25/July/1998 07:00am >>>
As I continue to develop my thinking about various transhuman and
related subject areas, I've come across an intuitive conclusion that I'd like
to hear feedbback on.

As intelligence and the societies/civilizations/structure- complexes it
creates become governed more by directed intelligent evolution than
natural evolution, it seems to me that it will only make changes that
increase its overall "state". Assuming we evaluate the state of a
civilization by comparing it to the limits prescribed by our current
understanding of physical laws, it appears that there should be an
"optimal state" that intelligent systems should tend towards. Regardless
of the initial environment, conditions, substrates, characteristics, etc. of 
civilizations, it seems that once they has harnessed the power of
directed evolution that they should tend to strive for this "optimal state".

This observation raises some interesting questions:

1 - Does this have any implications concerning the Great Filter concept,
i.e., is there something about this gravitation towards the "optimal state"
which could explain the lack of evidence of intelligence having filled the
cosmos? For example, perhaps the "singularity"-type acceleration 
towards this optimal state happens before a civilization can expand
significantly into its surrounding environment.
If the "optimal state" inhibits further expansion (for reasons
I can't fathom) that would explain why we don't see signs of these
civilizations.

2 - What insights can we draw into the nature of this
"optimal state" from our current knowledge of the natural limits (e.g., the
Planck Length, the speed of light, etc.)?

3 - What's the merit of evaluating optimality based on physical limitations?
What other possible criteria might there be?

4 - What would a civilization do once it reached the "optimal state"? In
concert with #1, would such a civilization "die" of boredom having
exhausted all the wonders of existence?

5 - Maybe its errant to think of the "optimal state" as an evolutionary
pinnacle and instead as an evolutionary singularity. What could possibly
lie on the other side of an evolutionary singularity?

>>>

Interesting train of thought.  An additional factor would be whether there
is only a single 'optimal' state, or whether there is more than one
depending on the starting point and path traversed by the civilisation. The
'optimal' states may also be unstable, resulting in any civilisation that
reaches one to quickly topple across to the other side.

Other possibilities resulting from the above analogy are local and global
maxima - for example, the ancient civilisations such as the Egyptians
could be considered manifestations of civilisations that reached local
maxima, as they appeared relatively quickly but then remained virtually
unchanged (technologically) for millenia.

I have missed a great deal of this discussion over the past week and would
like to know "where we are at" -- in other words, what sections have not yet
been addressed?  Will anyone have the opportunity to read over and suggest
revisions to sections that have already been written?  There are possibly
other persons who would like to contribute who are on vacation right now,
particularly as we move into August, so I may not be the only person who
would like to know this.

Thx,

Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Two suggested drafts of answers and a suggested revision of one of Nick's.
I think that this section is particularly important in a FAQ precisely
because it addresses, more than any other section, the fears that people
have with relation to transhumanist ideas.  I recommend an approach that
uses a personable style with a minimum of jargon and an emphasis on how
transhumanists themselves are addressing these issues.  

>What kind of society would posthumans live in?

The type of society that posthumans would develop does depend on the type of
posthuman that evolves from present-day humans.  We can speculate as to how
a posthuman might interact with humans, providing that a posthuman would
want to interact with humans at all, but it is difficult to imagine how a
society of posthumans might conduct their lives.  Any construction of a
posthuman society would be based on our experiences and desires as humans,
or as transhumans, and we cannot depend on those experiences or desires
having any relevance to a posthuman.  As the seeds of a posthumanity
develop, some of us hope to have the opportunity to observe their
interactions with humans, transhumans, and other posthumans, from which we
might formulate an idea of what kind of posthuman society would develop.

>What happens if these new technologies are used in war? Might they
>cause our extinction?

Some transhumanist ideas focus on the development of technology, but the
development of humans themselves also represents an important area within
transhumanist thought.  We think that each human has the ability to choose
positive change, and new technologies can provide the opportunity for many
humans to live with more individual freedom and to break away from
oppressive governments.  If we look at history, from ancient times to the
present, we can see a general trend away from brute force and towards
cooperation between individuals and between societies.  We can also see a
trend of using technologies previously used in war to support peaceful and
educational activities.  The Internet itself originally developed as a part
of the military infrastructure, but now its primary use is to support
research and personal communication in every field of human endeavor.
Although war remains a brutal reality in our world today, more humans have
chosen to support increased economic trade and communication between all
nations.  Transhumanists support the continued use of new technology in ways
that will benefit all humans, not just those who seek to gain power by means
of force.

SUGGESTED REVISION:

>Won't new technologies only benefit the rich and powerful? 
>What happens to the rest?

The typical pattern with new technologies is that they are expensive
in the beginning and become cheaper as time goes by.  In the medical
field, for example, experimental procedures are usually only available to
research subjects and the very rich. As these procedures become routine, the
cost of the procedures decreases, and more people gain access to them.  In
the field of consumer electronics, the price of advanced computers and
calculators drops as more complicated models are designed.    
- It is clear that everybody can benefit greatly from improved 
technology.  In the beginning, perhaps the greatest advantage will go to those 
who have the resources, the knowledge and especially the willingness 
to learn to use new tools.  Each society will still face the decision of how
to address inequalities between its richer and poorer members; in that
respect the situation will be no different from today. Yet, the pie that is
to be divided will be enormously much greater.
	Transhumanists encourage every society to embrace new technologies, as this
will allow every human to progress beyond their present level.  Many groups
have arisen to address the problem of distributing technology to undeveloped
areas, such as the 'freenet' movement that is working to provide Internet
access to communities that presently cannot afford to install access.  Many
transhumanists work in the field of science policy and support [NICK, I

Hi Natasha,

The FAQ is intended as a work in progress and a repository of group memory I
suppose.  I did not propose any of the questions on the FAQs except the
first one re: Futurism and Transhumanism (as a segue). I just answered the
FAQs that Nick Bostrom proposed on the Transhuman Digest and added other
FAQs I noticed from others on the Transhumanist and Extropian Digests (while
trying to credit and link sources for dialogue).  I would be **GREATLY**
interested in any other questions and responses that you would like to add
to the FAQs.  I am aware that my knowledge of Transhumanist History and Art
is minimal in particular.  I am reading up on these things especially lately
with Third Culture and now Last Flesh later maybe Selfish Gene and Infinite
in All Directions or Physics of Immortality.  (What are your suggestions?)
What I've read lately is at:
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/9356/WebRecommendations.htm.

>>And, as an aside, would you be kind enough to use "human" rather than
>>"man."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that I usually do (especially in the last "taxonomic speculation"
question).  I'll try to keep that in mind though.

P.S. I read about the Second Edition of Create/Recreate from you in one of
the 2 lists above.  How is that coming?  I'm interested in a copy.  (In a
letter with the book you mentioned half price for those who bought the First
Edition.)

>>Best,

>>Natasha

Dr Blackburn didn't give me a reference, I don't wish to pester her, and I
haven't been able to find it via the net.  I assume the Dr Beach in
question is the one at the Cold Spring Harbor Lab; his home site doesn't
list the paper.

If anyone locates it, I'd like to know myself.

Max, an excellent response to the so called population "problem".  To this I
add that the assumption that people are a problem is miserabilist and anti-
extropian assumption.  People are our greatest resource!  More people  to have
ideas and invent solutions to some of our real problems.  
The problem is not the extra, the too many people, but rather that they need
education and training to participate in the advancing of consciousness.  Due
to the political and economic problems, these people are worried about bread,
not evolution.  Perhaps a cross post to the CR list?

This flies in the face of almost every accepted technical understanding of
evolution.  `Progressive evolution' is *exactly* the prime instance of `a
romanticized "nature" ', I'd argue.  It sounds more like Theosophy than
science.  (Sorry.)

This component of the FAQ needs *excruciating* sensitivity.  Almost
everyone has a gag reflex at this suggestion.  I wonder (dunno if it makes
bio-botanical sense) if the suggestion might be better expressed as: if we
could design plants and vegetables that include certain animal genes, we
might be able to `grow steaks' in the same way we now grow tomatos or
lettuces.  [If that *doesn't* make sense for energetic reasons, we need to
rephrase the brainless cows scenario more delicately.]

Careful!  Whimsical homour is not read as such by believers - and there are

Many readers are non-mathematical.  You need to explain this a bit, even if
only by providding examples of the two progressions.

What about an animal version of hydroponics; simply growing the 
muscle tissue in a nutrient culture.  Surely a more easily grown 
version could be genetically engineered.  Besides, brainless cattle 
couldn't graze, anyway.  It would be inefficient to grow all the other 
cow constituents (hide, organs, skeleton, etc.) just to obtain a steak.

Don't be sorry.  Thanks for reading so closely: If you got the wrong
impression, anyone would.  In that one particular instance, my intent in the
use of the word "progress" was to convey the meaning "one thing after another"
as in "the progress of events", but because of it's more powerful teleological
connotation, the word has to go.  (As I re-read this with your comment in
mind, I don't know how I could have written this -- other than under the
influence of an overabundance of coffee: Coupled with the phrase "leading
edge", the teleological sense of "progress" seems the obvious
interpretation.).

Nicholas, consider my offering as modified to read as follows:

	Transhumanists do not see mankind as a fallen angel, somehow divorced and
	alienated from a romanticized "nature", but rather as merely one instance of 
	the process of evolution's continuing action in the natural world, and thus
as
	very much a part of nature.. 

Thanks, Damien.

True, but then what do you do when those violent individuals decide to
come visit your 'safe' neighbourhood? None of the people I know who've
had to defend themselves violent individuals were in particularly bad 
areas at the time.

Uh, that's just as likely to be because there are a lot less of them. In
fact, the best 'public health' solution to violent crime would probably 
be to 'quarantine' everyone in padded cells until they're 25.

The scanning/OCR process is cheap enough, a reliable robot to page the 
book would be significantly more expensive, though. I plan to scan my
hom library by hand, to make it more transportable. As to outlaw web
publishing: people are doing it for quite a while,
already. Unfortunately, Internet gets progressively regulated, so
you're likely to face stiff charges for copyright infringement in the 
future.

Relativity is not a GUT/TOE (in fact we're certain of it), and,
it _does_ seem to allow things like wormholes and causality
violation. One of (alas, too many) interpretations of Fermi's
paradoxon seems to be such expansion, whether relativistic or
otherwise, simply does not occur.

Assuming, that during the Singularity no new physics will be
discovered, which results in a technology not bottlenecked by such
constraints, as spacetime engineering. (Damn unlikely, of course).

Assuming we're all alive by then, of course. Technology growth seems
to require a relatively narrow corridor for us to make it into 2098:
too low, and we die of old age, too high, and we're wiped out by a
Blight.

The Russian army is making money as well, by part-time arms
trading. There is an interesting market for submachine guns and
bazookas hereabouts (a less interesting market involves leasing
military personnel for construction workforce). Maybe they should 
release the grip on the nuclear stockpile as well, I'm sure most of the 
missiles and launch crew will find excellently paying customers. Will
sure take care of the army budget hole.

We have agreed about what the list of questions should be 
(modifications can still be made). The questions are divided into
sections. I have been posting one section at a time and eliciting
people's answer-suggestions. On some questions I have also provided my
own answer-suggestions for people to comment on or improve. When the
two remaining sections have been treated in this way, then it's time
to write up. I've saved people's comments in a file so they can be 
used at this stage.

We haven't decided yet what the best way to write it up will be. One
person does it all? A few person do it all together? A few persons
each do a few answers? - Maybe the best way would be if perhaps four 
experienced transhumanists do it together in whatever way they think 
suitable?

When the first draft is completed, then it should be posted back 
to the list so people can make suggestions for what could be changed 
and improved.

Doug Baily has made the excellent suggestion that we complement the 
FAQ with a Transhumanist Profiles page on the WTA site (that anybody 
who want could copy), where prominent transhumanists explain their 
own perspective and views in a few paragraphs in a personal way. This 
would show the divesity of views in transhumanism and would allow 
people to say what they really think rather than just the inevitably 
somewhat watered-down quasi-consensus of the FAQ. But it is better 
not to start this until we have finished the FAQ.

Yes, electronic freedom might turn out to be another pipe dream after
all. Resistance is just too fragmented and lacks broad popular support,
or so it seems.

Thx for the update on the FAQ.  I have already submitted a few answers for
consideration and may have more to say as the other sections come up. 

I totally agree with Doug Bailey's suggestion of having a linked page with
comments from individual transhumanists.  Perhaps, if it is not too
complicated to set up, that page could link off of particular questions in
the FAQ.  For instance, if someone is reading the answer to one of the
questions about posthumanity, they could find a link to the comments of
individual transhumanists who have or are developing specific perspectives
on that topic.  I also think that it would be an excellent opportunity to
draw more thinkers into particular topics, by showing how new and wide open
this area of thought is, and how many avenues of it are open for exploration.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I don't know if it needs to be shortened.  If you don't mind, I'd like to
copy it in its entirety as a separate  FAQ sub-page due to its length on my
web site. **However**, I think that - other than religious queasiness of
some - this may be the most often quoted objection I've heard to
life-extension generally from scientifically-literate or at least inclined
lay people.  I think that actually the birth rate for longer-lived people
will go down per unit time because the primarily biopsychological imperative
behind reproduction is to replace your self genetically (and also transfer
your value system or worldview to the next generation).  This replacement
drive will not disappear but I think will ***lower*** the birth rate per
unit time. (obvious one kind per hundred years still results in 5 kids in
500 years whereas 3 per 70 finite years is lower but the rate is number
divided by unit time.....more time to make the scientific advancements in
food, space <e.g. terraforming other planets>, etc.)  I haven't focused on
this argument extensively because I haven't ever received input from others.
What do you think of the above argument about lower overall birthrate per
unit time for longer-living people?

Title
  Kava-kava extract WS 1490 versus placebo in
  anxiety disorders--a randomized placebo-controlled 25-week outpatient trial.
Source
  Pharmacopsychiatry.  30(1):1-5, 1997 Jan.
Abstract
  101 outpatients suffering from anxiety of non-psychotic origin (DSM-III-R
  criteria: agoraphobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and
  adjustment disorder with anxiety) were included in a 25-week multicenter
  randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial with WS 1490, a special
  extract of kava-kava. In the main outcome
  criterion, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), there was a significant
  superiority of the test drug starting from week 8 on. WS 1490 was also found
  to be superior with respect to the secondary outcome variables. HAMA
  subscores somatic and psychic anxiety, Clinical Global Impression,
  Self-Report Symptom Inventory-90 Items revised, and Adjective Mood Scale.
  Adverse events were rare and distributed evenly in both groups. These results
  support WS 1490 as a treatment alternative to tricyclic antidepressants and
  benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders, with proven long-term efficacy and none
  of the tolerance problems associated with tricyclics and benzodiazepines.

Title
  Tobacco control in a traditional Fijian village: indigenous methods of
  smoking cessation and relapse prevention.
Source
  Social Science & Medicine.  43(4):473-7, 1996 Aug.
Abstract
  This case study outlines the unique process by which a village in Fiji (N =
  238) developed and implemented an extremely successful community-based
  smoking cessation program. Both Western smoking cessation methods and native
  traditional rituals were used. Specific strategies included a group pledge,
  village rapid inhalation ceremony, social contracting through notices and
  media, and a tabu formalized through a kava ceremony.
  Whereas the more conventional, external, health professional oriented
  approaches were largely unsuccessful, longer term collaborative and village
  empowerment methods proved most successful. Eventually all persons in the
  village who smoked were able to give up smoking, with specific exceptions
  (elders, visitors, etc.) and became nationally known as the village that gave
  up smoking. Follow up evaluation at 9 and 21 months indicated sustained
  success. Cases of relapse are described involving supernatural consequences
  remedied by group and ceremonial methods. The socio-cultural context and
  larger relationship issues are discussed in order to more fully understand
  the effectiveness of the program.

No. Obviously you are not talking about 'rational egoism'. Real egoism
demands rationality as the first principle, because it recognizes the
value of rationality toward long-term prosperity, goal-achievement,
and happiness. Pragmatism, which is what you have been arguing for all
along, demands the rejection of principles for, yes, short-term, or
one-off gains - that is living 'range of the moment' and is not
rational and not egoism.

Might I recommend an experiment? Go find something obviously valuable,
in a store or on the street, wherever, where nobody is watching and
there are no burglar alarm systems, so that it is (apparently) quit
safe to purloin this article. Now, proceed to do so and simultaneousl
monitor your heart rate, breathing, and thoughts. Now, hide this
article somewhere 'safe' and 'secret' and keep monitoring your
reactions and thoughts for a period of a week or more... I think
you'll understand my point about psychosis. In fact, that fear will
not disappear in a week. Partly depending on the value of the article
you swiped and other factors, that fear could last your whole lifetime.

The evidence is all around us, if you care to look. Out of the
hundreds of people who commit serious crimes every year, find me one
who is not whacked out of his/her skull, and who has the sense to do
cost-benefit and risk analyses in the manner you suggest. Read "Inside
the Criminal Mind" by Stanton E. Samenow, or indeed, any honest book
on criminal psychology (which may be hard to find, since there is much
political motivation for obfuscating this issue) to understand the
cover-ups and the lies a criminal tells himself in order to delay the
inevitable breakdown of the integrating mechanisms in his mind. Of
course, with every successive layer of deceit added to ward off that
threat, he comes closer to it.

In any case, this is incidental to my main line of argument and I
don't want to get too involved in it here, or go digging in psychology
journals for you. I am quite convinced of this and you, perhaps, just
need to do some practical experimentation like I suggested above, or
some reading yourself. You could start with Dostoevsky's 'Crime and
Punishment' - it has some pretty vivid sections describing what I am
talking about. And yes, there is no happy murderer and no happy thief,
never was, and never will be.

> The self-interested egoist steals only when it benefits them in the

... and is only rational on alternate tuesdays and thursdays? You are
describing a pragmatist, not a rational egoist.

I would hope so too, but this is about the point that Robin Hanson usually
lobs in to mention that a small fraction with deviant growth rate will
quickly supplant a more self-controlled majority.  (If I understand the
Great Filter/Fermi argument.)  If everyone except a small bunch of
Catholics swallowed their combined immortality & sterility pill, the world
would soon be choked with die-hard (ahem) Catholics.  No?

True. Nobody knows, but I suspect that at that point the nation state
will be relatively powerless if not gone.

 Hey, folks. Ultimately you're just gonna hafta "Do It"
(perhaps offshore)and wait for a possible slap on the wrist.

It's probable that a full-fledged American police state is just
around the corner. At least, that's the trend.

Wrong. Violent crime is down due to a) greater ease for law abiding citizens to
go about their business armed (as evidenced by states retaining restrictive gun
policies have not seen their vilent crime rates drop at all or nearly as much as
states with liberalized gun laws), as well as b) youths that commit violent crime
usually wind up in jail for long terms now, or get shot by rivals. Once a crook
is shot by another crook, you have an immediate reduction in crime for the
future.

Due to thousands of years of breeding, cows already have one of, if not the
smallest brain/'body weight ratios of all mammals, so they are already
effectively lobotomized. THey have about the minimum brain mass necessary to be
what they are.

A more effective thing to do to reduce the 'uck' factor is to engineer the cow to
be more ugly, thus reducing the 'cute' factor from which the 'yuck' factor is
derived. Most animal rightists, even the most casual ones, are usually motivated
to avoid eating animals because of what we hunters call the 'Bambi Syndrome', and
this is why they usually focus their efforts on saving and protecting 'cute'
animals, while they do little for ugly animals. You don't get many protesters
trying to protect the Great White Shark.....

A much more efficient method of producing meat is to breed rabbits, but they
obviously are much farther up the 'cute' scale than cows are. Rabbits reproduce
far faster, and produce much healthier meat than cattle, and especially important
for space applications, they don't take up much space. The rabbit was selected by
O'Neil's space colony research project for protein supply.

I am much more hopeful that an anticipated upload transition can be much
smoother than an unanticipated transition.  People might
1) Diversify their assets, especially investing in capital likely to be in
demand in an early upload era.
2) More explicitly buy into insurance against upload transition risks.
3) accelerate research on uploading, so the first uploads are not too fast
relative to humans. 
4) gain a clearer image of the suffering and alienation early uploads must
deal with, to mitigate jealosy.

On Damien B.'s cue, I'll say I think Max's "inevitable" claim is too strong. 
There is nothing economically inevitable about wanting to have fewer kids when
you're rich; it's a matter of preferences.  And there are in fact a minority
of rich folks who seem to prefer large families, and whose kids do too.  

Our current world is very different from the world human preferences were 
selected for.  For some reason I'm not clear on, our evolved preferences and 
behaviors seem to choose to have fewer kids under "industrialized" situations.
But this behavior doesn't seem adapted to our new world.  It sure seems like
those who prefer larger families when rich should be eventually selected for.

Of course with human reproduction beingh as slow as it is, such selection takes 
time, and by the time it really starts to bite the world will change even more 
drastically.  I have written elsewhere about how I expect very strong selection 
effects with uploads.

The technical impediments to distributing information are long
dead; what remains are the legal impediments, chiefly copyright
law.  The most extropic thing one can do for the future now is
work to eliminate those impediments.  After all, it doesn't
matter how easy it is to get and distribute information if they
take you to court for doing it.

There is no DNA in hair. Perhaps they mean hair follicles? And perhaps,

Please quit tempting us to confess.  You know most extropians are weak
when it comes to holding back perfect counter arguments to a claim
that says "find me one [person]".  This is a cruel form of criminal
investigation.  Be strong people you don't HAVE to post.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Bambi Syndrome, there are lots of
Animal Rights 
types who would protest the destruction of a predator (aquatic or
otherwise). Witness
the (recently declared successful) efforts the protect the wolf in MN.

I'm also unsure of your application of the Bambi Syndrome to Elsie the
Cow. Many
animal rights protesters dislike farm animals because they are so
"unnatural".

Good points.  Unrealistic, of course - but still good points ;)

Sorry Buddy, but that wasn't me.  Although it seem to me that 'evolution'
can be self-directed once one becomes aware of the existence of the
concept.

Sure, but I'd suggest you delete the two sentences about brainless 
animals.

(If I were you I'd wait until the final version of the FAQ is ready - 
it should not take more than a month or so.)

I too find such claims suspect--they seem to be prime cases of post hoc,
ergo propter hoc.  One could probably find as much "evidence" for a
connection between Coca-Cola consumption and smaller families.

I suspect memetic influence is the likely causal factor, rather than
wealth.  We need look no farther than Madison Avenue to find memetic
attacks targeted at the well-to-do.

Also, my imperfect knowledge of history leads me to believe that the
connection between wealth and smaller families is one which doesn't go back
that far.

OTOH, the rich family that has lots of kids ends up dividing the pie a lot
of ways, ofttimes enough to disqualify the offspring from the "rich" title.
 If a significant percentage of the "rich" get that way by inheritance,
then the state of being "rich" will tend to evolve small families....

As nature doesn't measure wealth in dollars, I suspect this isn't a good
trade in the long run.

michael, this is one of the more insightful things i have seen in some time.as i
watched a program about kimodo dragons, another in the room
commented that if he had his way, every last one of those wretched
creatures would be hunted down and destroyed.  when was the last time
you heard someone say that about deer?

too bad kimodo dragons are not edible.  {8^D  spike

Er, this is untrue.  After all, the Great White Shark is ugly by default. 
Suppose we took a bunny rabbit and engineered it to be especially healthy
and horribly ugly.  Animal rights activists would surely show pictures
saying "Extropians want to turn this <picture of a cute bunny rabbit> into
THIS <picture of an ugly, but healthy, bunny rabbit>"  They'd be equally
appaled, if not more so.

From:    Suresh Rattan
Subject: Anti-aging hormesis effects

Here is the abstract of my recent publication on the anti-aging hormesis
effects of heat shock on human skin fibroblasts. Previously, anti-aging
effects of heat shock have been reported by others for Drosophila and
nematodes. Since the present experiments with human cells in culture took
much longer time than those for insects and worms, these results are being
published just now.

REPEATED MILD HEAT SHOCK DELAYS AGEING IN CULTURED HUMAN SKIN FIBROBLASTS

Suresh I. S. Rattan
Laboratory of Cellular Ageing, Danish Centre for Molecular Gerontology,
 Institute of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus,
 Gustav Wieds Vej, DK-8000 Aarhus - C, Denmark

Summary:        The effects of repetitive mild heat shock (30 min, 41=B0 C)
on growth and various cellular and biochemical characteristics of human
skin fibroblasts undergoing ageing in vitro were analysed. Human skin cells
not only tolerated more than 30 repeated heat shocks throughout their
replicative lifespan, but also maintained several characteristics of young
cells until late in life. Whereas the growth rates, population doubling
rates, and cumulative population doubling levels achieved in vitro remained
unaffected, age-related changes in cellular morphology, cell size,
cytoskeletal organisation, autofluorescence and neutral b-galactosidase
activity were significantly slowed down by repeated mild heat shock. These
hormesis-like effects of stress-induced defence processes can be useful to
elucidate the role of maintenance and repair mechanisms in ageing.

Key words: anti-ageing, homeostasis, hormesis, gerontogenes

Drexler is associated with two nanotechnology advocacy organizations:
Forsight institute and the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing.

Foresight puts on at leaset one major scientific conference a year.
Smalley was the keynote speaker last November. Most of the papers
are accessible from their web site.

The online version of the Journal of Pediatrics has provided full 
access to the article I previously mentioned that involves the sex 
reassignment of a biologically male child at:

http://www.pediatrics.org/current.shtml#ARTICLE

scroll down to the title: 'Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 
Months, Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in 
Young Adulthood' by Susan J. Bradley, Gillian D. Oliver, Avinoam B. 
Chernick, and Kenneth J. Zucker.

It is worth noting that the research by Money extensively cited at the 
beginning of the article involved the first known instance of male 
reassignment to female after a circumcision accident, and much of the 
medical literature written on this person claiming success has since 
been negated by the patient's own decision to return to male status.  

Sin,

I seriously doubt that; being rich has been associated with smaller families well
before there was any Coca-Cola.  I am convinced that there has been a robust and 
causal relationship between wealth and family size over the last few centuries. 
I just don't think this relationship is evolutionarily stable; given enough time,
it would be reversed.

I get your point, which only indicates that such modifications need to be introduced as
'accidental' or 'incidental' mutations that nobody actually had a hand in. Yeah its
underhanded, but so what. However, if the uglier animal produces more meat, or more
healthy meat, it will be seen as a good thing, with the ugliness only being incidental.
The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and vegetarianism
(which is why many more women than men are one or the other). Engineering ugliness into
any improved meat producing organism will reduce the amount of public aversion to it
being slaughtered for McNuggets. Though there may also be a bit of an uck factor, as in
"EEEEWWWW! You're gonna eat THAT???!!!

BTW, I had an ostrich steak dinner last week, and it was fabulous. While the meat is
lean, it is very flavorful, and not tough. Ostrich is a good candidate for an optimum
meat producer: a)very healthy meat, b) very ugly c)very ornery and obnoxious. I
recommend that anyone who has been avoiding red meats for health reasons to try ostrich
steak.

Ha, yeah. Though I dunno how much TV you guys watch, but there is a funny commercial

To which I said:

>some of us use memetic replicators...

And as serendepity would have it...I just this morning discovered an example
of other people doing it.  Using a memetic replicator I mean.

One of the many horrible, disgusting, vile and appalling  vices in which I
indulge is that I read lots of Science Fiction.  I prefer the good stuff but
I'll take just about anything when the "hunger" gets intense.

Well I've recently endured a rather long dry spell...and I'm reading
<blush>..."Hung Out"...by Margearet Weis and Don Perrin.

on page 198 it is said:

".....ranking somewhere above rats and rock-and-roll singers in intelligence;
equal perhaps to those other herd animals, politicians; but below the rest of
humanity."

I got a chuckle out of that...as it pretty well matches my own perspective.

But it also illustrates the "meme replicator"...perhaps one of the
oldest...but still more deadly weapons available.

Natasha  is aware of that as she said:

"And, as an aside, would you be kind enough to use "human" rather than "man."

                ..............in another thread she critiqued (unjustifiably
in my humble opinion)

Other examples of antagonistic memetic replicators are "nigger, kike, geek,
redneck, ......truckdriver"...the list goes on and on.

Some look upon it as a problem....I kinda think of it as an opportunity....and
constantly look for ways to harass and bring discomfort to my enemies. The
writers of this book...and many, many, more that I have read seem to think so
too.  I've been noticing that in my area of interest such vile scum as
politicians are not in great favor.

And they haven't figgered a way to register a memetic replicator yet...nor is
there a waiting list on it's acquistion....

The definition of `success' is somewhat labile here.  Consider the outcome:

=========================================

During childhood, the patient recalled that she
self-identified as a "tomboy" and enjoyed stereotypically masculine toys
and games; however, the
patient also recalled that her favorite playmates were usually girls and
that her best friend was always
a girl. 

When seen at age 16, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for
vaginoplasty. At that time,
she wished to proceed with the further repair of her genitalia to make them
suitable for sexual
intercourse with males. At age 26, the patient returned to the hospital for
further vaginoplasty. 

Regarding the patient's sexual orientation, she was attracted predominantly
to women in fantasy, but
had had sexual experiences with both women and men. At the time of the
second surgery, she was in
a relationship with a man and wished to be able to have intercourse. The
patient's self-described
sexual identity was "bisexual." After surgery at age 26 years, the patient
developed a rectovaginal
fistula. Within a few months of the surgery, the patient and her male
partner separated for reasons
other than the patient's physical problems. The patient subsequently began
living with a new partner,
a woman, in a lesbian relationship. 

=================================

Obviously, a person in a female-looking body who chooses to be a lesbian
has arrived at a satisfactory accommodation to gender reassignment.  But
given the basic issue at stake here, I'd have thought that persistent
primary sexual attraction to women is the key finding.  It looks to me as
if uterine Y-chromonsome governance of brain differentiation has indeed
marked this person as `male', for the broad purposes of the discussion.

Thanks for an incredibly interesting reference, Kathryn.

har!  i am continuously amazed at the fathomless creativity of  the tvmarketing

Some points that you may want to consider in this discussion. Birth rates
are directly related to both life expectancy and education. Therefore in
an Extropian future in which both of these qualities are more abundant the
population problem may be a nonissue. In the Western countries (U.S.,
Canada, Western Europe) population growth is negative if one discounts
immigration. This wealth-education effect has been confirmed in
developing countries as well. Numerous children serve as cheap
labor/social security in poor countries. As the wealth increases the
benefits of the tradeoff of current for future resources shrinks and the
number of offspring does likewise. Humanity is able to look to the future
and make decisions based on personal benefit. This reasoning ability
counters the tendency to breed indiscriminately. 

The current projections of the United Nations predict a leveling off of
global population by the mid 21st century with a high estimate of I
believe 18 billion. Birthrates are slowing around the globe which is a
fact that an alarmist media continues to overlook. The media would rather
play up Cassandra predictions like those of Paul Ehrlich who has been
consistently wrong since the Club of Rome predictions in the early 1970's.

I am surprised that Julian Simon has not been mentioned yet.

It's not *that* old.  It's a 19th century phenomenom (still pre-Coca-Cola).  
In the 18th century wealthy English on average had more children than 
poor or middle class ones.  I believe the first country to experience the 
demographic transition, including the inversion of the traditional association
between wealth and fecundity, was France, shortly after the Revolution.

A point: the driving force is not wealth but female education.  Wealth plus 
uneducated women (some Muslim countries) = high birth rate; education plus
poverty (the Indian state of Kerala) = low birth rate.  There's just a very 
strong correlation between wealth and education, with causation probably going
in both (educated people tend to get rich and rich children tend to get
educated)

Its a movie from the early 90's starring Mathew Broderick and Marlon Brando, and involves
a Kimodo Dragon that is scheduled to be eaten at a 'Gourmet Club'. It's very funny.

Well, the woman has not identified as a lesbian, and the authors have
exhibited a great deal of confusion over the definition of bisexuality, as
was pointed out by several readers in private mail to me this morning.  By
her behavior, I would agree that she may have a bisexual orientation.

Actually, the key finding is the mutability of gender within the first seven
months of life, a finding that has raised the spectre of parents being put
under even more pressure to put their intersexual children into surgery at a
young age.  The authors think that the first case was unsuccessful because
the surgeons waited until 21 months, whereas in this case the surgeons acted
within seven months.  This conflicts with the assertions of William Riener
at Johns Hopkins University, who is in the process of studying intersexual
children who have been surgically altered.  He has not yet published any
results, but in a television interview he says that, out of the 16 c
children in the study, two have already changed their gender identity upon
hitting puberty.  So, these two studies raise the question:  when does
gender identity form permanently--early in life or at puberty?

Reason is a servant of preferences.  If all you care about is living 
comfortably, then children can be a burden which wise folks avoid.  But
if children are a source of joy to you, then you might buy more of them
as you get richer.  (In econ lingo, they could be a "normal" good.)

I think Natasha is right to call those antagonistic memes, but
we must be careful to distinguish between the meme itself and the
mere word--the sounds and shapes by which it is spread.  Indeed,
as much experience in the use of language has shown, the taboo
on the words actually increases the virulence of the meme, because
it prevents other memes from competing for the same word.  The gay
community has shown us a great example by their "reclamation" of
words like "queer", that new ideas, connotations, and implications
can be given to a word to fight the old ones effectively.

I proudly call myself a "geek", and seek to instill implications
of intelligence, resourcefulness, power, and industry into the
word to combat (or at least supplement) its connotations of
social ineptitude and pedantry.  An amusing example of that is
when a stripper once asked my occupation in casual conversation,
I told her "I'm a computer geek".  She asked why I would insult
myself like that...while she was at the time wearing a leather
dog collar with "slut" spelled in rhinestones.

Well, she was proud of being a professional slut, and should be;
she was quite good at it.  Just as I am an excellent geek, and Max
is a top-notch philosopher.  Perhaps we can help restore some
positive connotations to that epithet one day.

A geek is someone who eats live animals.  I'm not so sure this word is
worth reclaiming.(unless you're geekier than I thought ;-)

I'll try this again, hopefully without the topic returning to guns, guns,
libetrtarians and guns, which IMO is a thread going nowhere.

Alcoholism was once seen as a moral issue, that the alcoholic was a person
of weak moral force, an essentially bad person who could not control
themselves. The moral solution was to make alcohol an illegal substance,
bring in the cops and the guns.  The result was organized crime had a new
field to exploit and violence in the manufacture, sale and distribution of
alcohol.

When AA was started, a new viewpoint was created, that of alcoholism as a
disease, both physically and spiritually. Instead of prohibiting the
substance, the treatment became one of medical treatment and counseling.
Without attempting to claim or debate whether this is more effective re the
problem of alcoholism, it is an approach with less violence.

Ditto of course for the Drug War...

Well, what about violence? Violence is of course criminalized, those prone
to it are treated as criminals and morally bankrupt, fodder for punishment.
(Note: I am speaking of the violence found in families and on the street,
not military actions which is a whole other topic.) My question is:

	What if we looked at violence as a health problem??
	===================================================

Well, a major aspect of public health is to design the environment to be
safer. Separate water and sewage, ensure that food is not contaminated,
ensure safe water, and these days, eliminate pollution and pesticides.

In the 1950s many public housing projects consisted of tall buildings with
long hallways with doors to each apartment and stairwells. Gangs discovered
thay could disable the elevators and attack people in the halls and
stairwells. This was such a serious problem that eventually most of these
buildings were razed. (A few months ago, such a project in San Francisco
was demolished.) If a building is built so that all apartments look into a
central area, with patios and balconies, so that all traffic to and from
apartments is seen from the other apartments, this kind of crime vanishes.
This is a public health kind of solution for one kind of violence.

Such solutions are enforced the same way that any other government policy
is enforced. First write up the rules, and don't issue permits to
scofflaws. Second, don't allocate money to those who will create structures
in which volence tends to happen. (Just like the Feds will withold their
money from local government unless the local government conforms to the
Federal demands.) And, finally, locate the serious nuisances and shut them
down.

Note, BTW, that I fully support more libertarian approaches, such as PPLs.
However, coercion is a fact of life and especially of governance.

Another aspect of public health is testing for, isolating and treating
disease. This can be done to some degree with violence, testing individuals
for such tendencies, immunizing them (ie, educating them), etc. How to do
this is of course a topic with many implications. Just for fun, here is one
possible approach:

All landlords and all lending institutions are by law made degree liable
for violence which happens on their property. Homeowners are their own
landlords. To be released from this liability is via an examination for
violent tendencies. A person who passes this examination is given a
certificate which is to be shown to the landlord. Persons not passing the
exam may either assume the liability or go in for treatment.

Think about it. If you meet a new sexual partner, do you discuss STDs?
Pregnacy control?

I'm certain that URL will get hacked in two pieces so
you may want to just go to the Times site and do
a search for "Minsky".

MSNBC's site has a suite of articles regarding aging.
While some of the articles are informative for the 
average reader, the article on the implications of
immortality is deplorable. The writer refers to such
potentialities of immortality as "centuries-long anxiety
attacks" and "decades of toilet training." In a more
discretionary tone, the author shows how the conquering
of the aging process would not ensure immortality. However,
the author does not make the "transhumanism" jump to
speculating about other technologies that would allow
humanity to escape many of the traditional perils that
governed the actuarial conclusions mentioned in the article.

                 IBM scientists help discover "molecular
                 wheels" -- a breakthrough for designing
                 nanoscale devices 

                 On July 24, IBM scientists
                 and a team of international
                 collaborators reported the
                 discovery of "molecular
                 wheels": propeller-shaped
                 molecules that rotate rapidly
                 in a bearing-like structure
                 formed by surrounding
                 molecules. The scientists
                 believe this unexpected
                 phenomenon shows great
                 promise for the development of molecular mechanical devices
                 and further demonstrates the validity of using single molecules to
                 perform the various functions required in such devices. 

                 In a paper published in Science, IBM's Zurich Research
                 Laboratory, together with colleagues at the French National
                 Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Toulouse, and the Riso
                 National Laboratory in Roskilde, Denmark, report their design of
                 the propeller-shaped molecules which can switch between two
                 states -- rotating and immobilized, and the high-speed molecular
                 rotation which they observed by using a scanning tunneling
                 microscope (STM). 

                 "Our discovery of the molecular wheel came about from recent
                 molecular switch experiments in which we were investigating a
                 reversible change in the shape of specifically designed molecules
                 triggered by a voltage pulse from the STM tip," said James
                 Gimzweski, who leads the nano-engineering effort at IBM's Zurich
                 Research Laboratory. "We believe that compared to other
                 proposed or synthetic molecular mechanisms, the molecular
                 wheel, which works in a dry state and appears to be wearless, is
                 advantageous for creating gears and motors at the nanoscale
                 level." 

                 In viewing the
                 STM images, the
                 researchers
                 found a ring-like
                 object instead of
                 the molecule that
                 had been there.
                 The object, now
                 in a slightly
                 different position,
                 shifted by just
                 one-fourth of a
                 nanometer. It evidently jumped into a tiny space left vacant by an
                 irregularity in the molecular layer and thus escaped the
                 immobilizing grip of four molecules that surrounded it closely on
                 one side. An adjacent molecule on the other side confined its
                 further lateral motion and, in effect, contributed to forming a
                 bearing for rotation of the central molecule. This rotation was
                 responsible for the blurred, ring-like appearance of the molecule
                 in the STM image. Researchers at CNRS calculated the behavior
                 of the molecular wheel. Such wheels may someday become the
                 smallest conceivable components of molecular engines.

They could be but acknowledging this possibility is a far cry from the
supporting the hypothesis that there is a selection pressure towards
having large families. Could you provide some historical examples to back
up the assertion that rampant breeders tend to swamp out those with less
prolific tendencies?

I am familiar with the education-wealth inverse correlation but have not
encountered any demographic studies that demonstrated that selective
pressures for numerous offspring operate in humans except in agricultural 
societies or in societies where women are undereducated. It
could be argued that if given the opportunity humans will tend to have
fewer offspring and invest more in each individual to enable them a
greater likelihood to further reproduce. A Quality rather than Quantity
approach to evolutionary strategy.

it takes the sting out of antagonistic memetic replicators ifthe intended

most effective example of this i can think of is the homosexual community
and the term "queer", by naming a gay organization "queer nation".

the racially charged memetic replicators, such as the famous n word
we heard so much during the  oj simpson trial, are never effectively
co-opted.  counterexample?  i have called myself a computer geek many

Normally messages about e-mail viruses are indeed hoaxes, but this one is
different.  If you have certain e-mail handling programs, including widely
used programs from Microsoft and Netscape, you will be effected by any
e-mail sent to you that is crafted to exploit this vulnerability.  In the
process of receiving e-mail that has a special kind of long name for its
MIME attachment, the e-mail receiving program will activate code
(instructions) written by a virus writer.  Although there are no reports of
such viruses being sent yet, if you have the wrong kind of e-mail program,
you will be completely vulnerable to the any virus crafted to attack your
program.  Security experts expect such e-mail viruses to be sent soon.

I am a computer programmer and had the title Systems Analyst at Syntex, the
pharmaceutical company.  I will explain how this class of virus can cause
havoc even without you intentionally running a program, running a Word
macro, or opening an attachment.

If you want to jump straight to the article, or read it yourself, I've
copied it exactly as published on the free Web site of the San Jose Mercury
newspaper, whose URL I include below.  I am violating their copyright
because of the gravity of this threat.  If in doubt about the authenticity
of my copy of the article, browse the Mercury's site.  The Mercury is a
fine source of computer and high tech reporting.  I hope they will treat my
transgression as a form of advertising for their Web site and their "scoop"
of this story.

First, not all e-mail programs are at risk: if you are using a Eudora mail
reader, such as Eudora Lite or Eudora Pro, this virus cannot damage your
system.  You can read the reassurance at <http://www.eudora.com>, near the
bottom of the long page.  But the problem is present in "Microsoft's
Outlook Express and Outlook 98, and Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Messenger Mail, which accompanies versions 4.x of the Communicator Web
browser software. Other e-mail readers may be affected" (quoted from the
article below).

Now, how can just an e-mail be used to attack a computer?  The e-mail
reading program stores a piece of text (the name of the MIME attachment in
this case) starting at a particular place in memory, called a "buffer".  A
correctly written program checks that the text of the attachment name does
not exceed some length.  But in this case, with some very widely used
e-mail programs, the programmers failed to put in the code that prevents a
long name from going past the normal end of the buffer.  This was the same
kind of flaw that allowed the infamous "Morris worm" to take control of
UNIX computers years ago, bringing down much of the Internet for a day or so.

So, how does a long name that goes past the normal end of buffer cause
trouble? In these cases there are memory locations beyond the end of the
buffer that the e-mail reading program expects to contain executable code
(instructions to do something normal).  But the virus writing "crackers"
(often called "hackers") carefully construct a VERY LONG name so that it
contains bytes of information that fall exactly where the executable code
normally occurs.  The "good" instructions of the program get replaced by
bytes from the long name.  The particular bytes of information are
transmitted as part of a long name, but because they are placed in a
location that the program "knows" will contain instructions, the bytes are
treated as instructions.  The crafty virus writer will choose the bytes to
be ABNORMAL CODE that, when executed, causes the e-mail program to go to
and begin executing malevolent code the virus writer has stored still later
in the actual MIME attachment.  That malevolent code can do anything that
the virus writer chooses.

So, because of a failure to prevent buffer overflow, some e-mail programs
are vulnerable to such subversion of their normal activities.  These
failures to block buffer overflow are rare, and becoming rarer as
programmers become more aware of this class of threats.  But apparently
such failures ("bugs") are present today in some e-mail programs.  Security
experts detected the problem first, but because some people might leak the
news to virus writers, the security experts have publicized the problem and
programmers are developing patches and new versions of the e-mail programs
to eliminate the overflow possibility.

So what should you do?  If you are using one of the defective mail reading
programs, check the Web site of the creators, who will post patches and
instructions soon.  They understand the virulence of the threat.  Don't
delay, because what I explained here is common knowledge among virus
writers, and they may exploit these buffer overflow defects very soon.
Take this virus scare seriously.  You may want to download a free copy of
Eudora Light or purchase the full featured (and quite good) Eudora e-mail
program.  Eudora's programmers protected their buffer and deserve the extra
business that may come their way.

Hopefully, the security experts and authorities will be watching for "spam"
that includes these very long, carefully constructed, MIME attachment
names.  And hopefully they will find the sender(s) of such virus e-mail and
prosecute them for damage done.  And hopefully both Microsoft and Netscape
programmers will be more careful in the future.  But for now, if you are
using certain e-mail programs, you are at risk.

           U.S. issues alert over e-mail flaw


Emergency bulletin calls problem extremely serious

BY DAVID L. WILSON
Mercury News Staff Writer 

The U.S. Energy Department's computer security team confirmed Tuesday that
a significant security flaw exists in three of the most popular e-mail
programs around that, left unrepaired, could have catastrophic consequences
and urged users to repair or replace the software.

Corporate technology managers spent Tuesday frantically scrambling for more
information about the flaw, which was first reported in the Mercury News.
And users found it difficult to find the correct patches for the the
security hole.

Software companies initially provided little additional technical
information about the problem and no real fixes. Microsoft Corp., for
example, offered patches that were determined to be ineffective and were
subsequently withdrawn.

The flaw, which allows an outsider to send a booby-trapped e-mail message
capable of executing commands on the user's computer --- anything from
sending out thousands of e-mails in the user's name to erasing the hard
drive --- exists in some of the most popular software in the world:
Microsoft's Outlook Express and Outlook 98, and Netscape Communications
Corp.'s Messenger Mail, which accompanies versions 4.x of the Communicator
Web browser software. Other e-mail readers may be affected, but most
researchers now believe that another commonly used program, Qualcomm
Corp.'s Eudora, is safe. The flaw can be exploited on the most common
computer operating systems.

The Computer Incident Advisory Capability, the Energy Department's team,
headquartered at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, declared in an
emergency bulletin that the situation is extremely serious: ``We base this
assessment on the ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited, the
widespread use of the vulnerable e-mail/news readers and the potential for
doing serious damage to a computer.''

Microsoft attempted to post patches for the hole in its products Monday,
but technical problems kept most users from getting to them. Then the
company discovered that the first set of patches didn't work. Anybody who
downloaded the first set of patches is urged by the company to download
them again, probably later this week. Alternatively, users can download a
free copy of Eudora Light until a patched version of their favorite e-mail
program is available.

Some users believed the story was incorrect because it is so similar to a
well-known Internet hoax called the Good Times virus. Typically, a user
gets an e-mail warning them to delete any e-mail with the subject ``Good
Times'' because, if opened, the Good Times e-mail will reformat the hard
drive. The warning message urges the recipient to ``send this to all your
friends,'' creating a flood of unnecessary e-mail and chewing up system
resources. 

Normally, e-mail alone can't do any damage to a system. But attackers can
attach a file that's essentially a program to an e-mail message. If a user
runs that program, it could do damage to the system, which is why system
administrators warn users to avoid opening attachments from strangers.

But this latest flaw can be triggered in some cases without even opening
the booby-trapped e-mail.

The problem can be exploited by assigning an exceptionally long file name
--- sometimes hundreds of characters --- to an attachment. If the name is
too long, it will overflow the e-mail program's buffer. At that point, any
software code contained in that overflow can sometimes execute commands on
the user's computer.

The problem is related to MIME capabilities, or Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions, which let e-mailers work with items besides text. MIME headers
tell the e-mail software how to treat the file. Older e-mail software that
is not MIME-compliant is not vulnerable to the hole.

While no one believes this flaw has been exploited outside the laboratories
where it's been researched for the past month, experts are urging users and
computer system administrators to repair their systems as quickly as
possible, on the assumption that ``black hat'' hackers will soon be
exploiting the problem.

``I'm just scared that somebody is going to spam the world with this.
Soon.'' said William J. Orvis, a security specialist with CIAC.

Computer system administrators around the world are studying the situation,
trying to see what needs to be done.

``We don't normally comment on our internal systems, for security
reasons,'' said Lew Wagner, senior manager of the corporate information
security department at networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. Wagner, however,
said the standard e-mail package used inside Cisco is not affected by the
problem, adding there could be some people within the organization who are
using something else.

``We're trying to make sure our 14,000 employees are not using any
unauthorized applications,'' he said.

An interesting aspect of the newly-released independent film 'Pi' relates to
the manner in which it was filmed.  Aranofsky, the director, intended to
create a sharp contrast between the subjectivity and objectivity--the
subjectivity of the mathematician's mental processes and the world around
him versus the objectivity of the mathematical struture he was attempting to
impose on his world.  Therefore, the production crew made the decision to
film in 'black or white', which is different from 'black and white' in that
there are no grey tones in the film.  This style also harkens back to the
early days of sci-fi.

Title
  The effects of an extract of Ginkgo biloba, EGb 761, on cognitive
behavior and longevity in the rat.
Source
  Physiology & Behavior.  63(3):425-33, 1998 Feb 1.
Abstract
  Extracts of the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree are widely used
throughout the world for their purportedly beneficial effects on brain
function. In the present investigation, a standardized extract, EGb 761,
was self-administered orally by male Fischer 344 rats that were then tested
in an eight-arm radial maze. The tasks employed were a) continuous learning
and b) delayed nonmatching to position. Chronic postsession administration
of EGb 761 at a dose of 50 mg/kg had no effect on continuous learning but
the same dose given presession resulted in a trend toward fewer sessions to
reach criterion performance as well as fewer errors. In addition, it was
observed that rats chronically treated with EGb 761 lived significantly
longer than
vehicle-treated subjects. In a delayed nonmatching to position task using a
30-min delay in 20-month-old rats. EGb 761 administered presession produced
a dose-related decrease in total, retroactive, and proactive errors; a
repeated-measures design was used, with subjects serving as their own
controls. Following the dose-response determination, the group, now 26
months of age, was divided in two with half receiving EGb 761 at a dose of
200 mg/kg presession and the other half vehicle (sweetened condensed milk).
A statistically significant positive effect of treatment with EGb-761 was
observed. The present data are consistent with the beneficial effects on
cognitive performance which have been widely reported in human subjects. In
addition, the data suggest that the methods employed, i.e., continuous
learning and delayed nonmatching to position tasks in aged rats, are
capable of detecting drugs of possible value in the treatment of human
cognitive impairment. Finally, the present results encourage a search for
the pharmacologically active principles of EGb 761 and for their mechanisms
of action.

Additional quote from text:

  "An unexpected observation made during the continuous-learning
experiments was that treatment with EGb 761 appeared to extend the life
span (Fig.2). Because an effect on longevity was not an original goal of
the experiments and because several animals had died before the effect
became apparent, formal assessment of the causes of death was not
undertaken. Based on the well-established fact that caloric restriction
extends the life span in rodents, it might be argued that EGb 761 somehow
acted to alter food intake and weight gain. However, retrospective
evaluation revealed no significant difference in weight between the EGb 761
and control groups at the time of death. Although the mechanism by which
energy restriction extends life is unknown, oxidative stress and free
radical production are thought to be important factors both in aging and in
dementia. Thus, the known effects of Ginkgo biloba as an antioxidant and
free radical scavenger provide alternative, though highly speculative
explanations of the data of Fig.2. Because the data shown in Fig.2 reflect
lifetime administration of a relatively low dose of EGb 761, immediate
questions arise as to whether initiation of treatment later in life would
have had a comparible effect and as to whether higher doses would have been
more effective. I am aware of no previous reports regarding possible
effects of EGb 761 on longevity."

Additional note added by poster:

  Here's an interesting project in the field of gerontology: Feed various
subfractions of EGb 761 to aged rodents to determine the ingrediant(s)
active in providing the life span prolongation and note the effect on
various causes of mortality to help ascertain the mode(s) of action.
  From Fig.2 the average life span was 26.4 months for the control Fisher
344 rats, and 31.0 months (17% increase) for the EGb 761 treated rats.
Maximum life span was 35 months for the control rats, and 38 months (9%
increase) in the EGb 761 treated rats. Dosage of EGB 761 used was 50 mg/kg
5 times per week.

All very well, but _every_ package is riddled with several 
constructive buffer overflows exploits, so it is sufficient 
_merely to go online_. Crackers, whose favourite pasttime 
is to nuke Win95 lusers dialing in via PPP could execute 
any code they wish on them. HOWTO tutorials to write them 
are on the web. 

The only way to be more or less immune is to run Linux, read 
Bugtraq digest daily and apply kernel patches on a daily/weekly 
basis. To be effectively immune, you need dynamic genetic 
diversity (GP on application code), which probably requires
nonalgorithmic systems. Meaning, we're in for several iterations of
the digital plagues.

I can't cite you demographic studies.  But it seems pretty obvious to me
that a typical couple in Bologna Italy, where the average kids/couple 
is .8, would have more long-run progeny if they had eight kids.  Yes 
their immediate factor of ten gain would be mitigated by those kids
each having fewer progeny.  Going to less expensive schools, having less
direct time with parents, having less money for fashionable clothes, etc.
would likely make them less successful in finding mates and gaining 
resources to raise them.  But I find it very hard to believe they'd 
suffer anything like a factor of ten.

One thing I didn't find on that web site was information about the author.
Who is Robert A. Freitas?  What are his credentials?  Is he an M.D.?
Biochemist?  Engineer?

This book series seems highly speculative to me.  It is very early to be
predicting specific nanotech devices for medical purposes, especially in
enough detail to fill a three volume set!  I can see making some sketches,
a few general ideas of what would be possible, like Leonardo's visions
of flying machines.  But I doubt that we are able today to predict the
specifics of these future machines in the kind of detail that would
justify such a publication.

The last item of his FAQ asks about the benefits of such technology.
After pointing out the obvious, elimination of disease, pain and
suffering he goes on to discuss brain enhancements.

It's a huge step from fixing broken chromosomes and killing bacteria to
being able to interface to a Library of Congress neuron.  Glossing over
the immense difficulty of the "appropriate interface mechanisms" makes
this a highly misleading example, in my opinion.  The tiny nanocomputer
is problematical as well.  I suspect that "only" .001 watt, when emitted
by a device the size of a cell, would cause significant localized cooling
problems, not to mention the software problems needed to make effective
use of this computer within the framework of the brain.

Overall the book sounds like it may be an interesting piece of speculative
engineering, but I wonder whether it will do much in the long run to
advance nanotechnology.

In discussing a business proposal with a friend, a question came up that I
didn't have the answer to and I'm disseminating it as widely as possible to
see what sources of information I might find.  Does anyone on the list have
access to data about the economics of discount retailers?  In particular, I'm
looking for the unit costs that retailers like Fry's and Circuit City face
that are attributable to "bricks and mortar", i.e. the costs they incur in
maintaining a physical retail outlet and any warehouses and internal
distribution infrastructure they maintain.  I'd appreciate any information or
leads anyone might be able to offer.

Sorry if this is a little off-list...

We have also been considering how we might put Crit to use on Extropy Online,
and possibly the ExI site itself. Does anyone on this list have the knowledge
and time to help with this, or at least offer advice on how to get it going?
If it's as good as it seems, it would be great for us to start using it in
all ExI online publications, ja?

always the naysayers.

I read "Engines of Creation"...that got me hooked on the idea...and I searched
in vain for several years thereafter for more info.  Speculative engineering
has a very definite place.  "Pep Squads" are not all bad.  For some of
us...the mathematically challenged...it's about all we have.  And were sure
not gonna get it from the mass media.

If we use the CRIT mediator website, does that eliminate the need for
downloading the CRIT software into each individual's computer, or do you
need to download it to read the margin notes?

As far as I know, no special knowledge is required -- that's the beauty of
Crit.  Just go to the Crit site, then go to the web page you mean to "mark up"
or comment on from the Crit site.  The Crit moderator does all the work for
you of making the commentary pages, inserting the editorial signals into the
original page, etc.

Go to the Crit site and check it out: it ALL works through your browser --
that's what makes it so damned smart!

I may have missed discussion of using Crit in connection with EO . . . but I
think it's a GREAT idea.  Perhaps we could launch a Crit discussion of the
Singularity piece(s) from the EO website?
