I'm prepared to go out on a limb and say that automation (basically
increased efficiency, the same work done by fewer people) will never result
in a state in which there *can't* be job creation in new industries or in
old industries invigorated by said automation.

I don't see any difference between the coming automation and the process of
automation that's been happening since the industrial revolution got
underway. A failure to imagine new industries and whole new areas of
productive human labor open to people displaced by robots (indeed, *enabled*
by the use of those robots) doesn't mean those things don't exist. Just like
the same failure to figure out what all those farm laborers in 1900 would be
doing as they were replaced by farm automation, and all those household
domestics would be doing as they were replaced by household
automation...things seem to be just fine as a result of those enormous gains
in automation (making 99% or so of those previous workers redundant), and
we're all better off for it. If you asked the man on the street in 1900 what
the millions of farm workers would be doing with themselves, I doubt you'd
have got a good answer.

Actually demonstrating this would likely make waves, which would be 
good. Could you describe the experiment in more detail?

Because sometimes they are they ones that have power. We need to
convince neighbours, co-workers, bosses and pundits that what we are
seeking is acceptable, or we will never get it. And the first step is to
sharpen our arguments.

I think two things got muddied together through some fault in my wording.  I 
was attempting to say that an important part of Intelligence Augmentation is 
to learn to discuss even difficult and highly emotionally vested subjects 
rationally and in a civilized manner.  Else those parts of our intelligence 
that are highly emotionally overlaid either will not be easy to augment or 
perhaps will be unsafe to augment because we amplify the range of our 
irrational emotions.    A part of Intelligence Augmentation is increasing the 
effectiveness and extent of our shared understanding and pooling of 
knowledge, talents and insights.  If we are unable to get beyond our 
emotional baggage sufficiently that part of IA will be seriously limited.

That seems illogical.  Automation without AI made certain forms of fairly 
manual repetitive tasks be uneconomical if done by humans.  Computation 
greatly increased the number of tasks that humans are not competitive in.  
Increasing AI in our automation may well eventually produce AI that is more 
intellectually capable than any human being.  At that time I would expect 
most tasks to be assigned to non human labor.   The only exclusions would be 
certain types of service jobs.   And there will be only so much demand for 
those, almost certainly not enough to employ everyone.

What is missing here is that the pace and extent of technological change and 
thus the range of automation is greatly increased.  So an analogy to the turn 
of the last century is not particularly appropriate.    We on this list most 
seem to believe that the day will come when humans are outcompeted by 
automation including AI on a very large range of tasks.   It stands to reason  
that the remaining set of tasks will not forever be sufficient to provide 
employment for all of them, even assuming perfect retraining.    

Now it is certainly a very open question what, if anything, should be done in 
such an eventuality.    It is also an open question to what extent we are 
already experiencing this effect.

I am not sure it is acceptable to let our dreams and goals be larger at the 
mercy of convincing our neighbours, co-workers, bosses, pundits and so on.    
Many of our dreams do not logically require that much cooperation to acheive.

I would tend to agree with Anders -- it should not be too difficult to
setup some controlled experiments.  Across the U.S., across Canada,
across Australia, perhaps some equivalent distance points in Europe.

If it really were true that "hot" messages get delayed (and one ought
to test different types of "hot" messages), it would be something that
could be submitted to /. and would probably end up in the NY Times.

In part because carnivore/DCS1000 is only *supposed* to be used to
track email from "suspected" individuals.  I have a really hard time
believing, given the mind-set of many individuals who work for ISPs,
that if this were being done that it could remain secret for long.

I also note that the article dates are 2001 and a lot has happened
since then -- some of which we may be unaware of due to the Patriot
Act(s).

I think there are two aspects to this (a) emotional reactions; and (b)
experiences with a high emotional content.  Basic survival mechanisms
would seem to place an emphasis on both -- you have to be able to respond
quickly (with emotion) under some circumstances; and you have to be able
to balance emotional experiences which may have conflicting indications
with respect to the promotion of survival.  Dealing with (a) has to do
with how one manages debate -- (one can contrast the "style" of the
British parliment with the U.S. Senate for example).  Dealing with (b)
has to wrestle with how one legitimately "balances" the significance
of various personal (self and other) experiences.

I think (a) we may be able to refine while (b) may be much more difficult
to deal with -- I think this goes to the heart of why Greg said that
it seemed pointless to engage in political debates -- they are rooted
in personal experiences and you cannot simply wave a magic wand and
make those "disappear".

Eco's book is what got me started. I finished it last week, noting a
number of synchronicity events with other novels I've read in the
last few months (for example: J.L. Borges, Labyrinths), and a
longtime interest in comedy / humor theories and stories. I had a
picture in my mind while reading the novel, too, of a medieval
monastery called Maulbronn, in southern Germany, which I visited
when I first moved to Germany in 1998. Apparently the filming of the
movie was there, even though Eco's novel places it in Northern
Italy. The Maulbronn monastery is a very interesting, lovely place
(and they produce a fine wine: "Five Fingers Wine".. ask me
sometime why they named their wine with that name).

Eco's book is *marvelous*. It's about twenty years old now, that is
why I wondering if anything has developed during these last two
decades regarding the Aristotle 'lost' book idea.


(from _Name of the Rose_, pg. 491)

"Perhaps the second book of Aristotle really did teach how to distort
the face of every truth, so that we would not become slaves of our
ghosts. Perhaps the mission of those who love mankind is to make
people laugh at the truth, to make truth laugh, because the only
truth lies in learning to free ourselves from insane passion for the
truth."

------------

from _Name of the Rose_, Pg. 473-7

"'But what frightened you in this discussion of laughter? You cannot
eliminate laughter by eliminating the book.'

'No, to be sure. [...] But here, here... the function of laughter is
reversed, it is elevated to art, the doors of the world of the
learned are opened to it, it becomes the object of philosophy, and
of perfidious theology [...] Laughter frees the villein from fear of
the Devil, because in the feast of fools the Devil also appears poor
and foolish, and therefore controllable. But this book could teach
that freeing oneself of the fear of the Devil is wisdom. When he
laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the villein feels he is
master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his
lord; but this book could teach learned men the clever and, from
that moment, illustrious artifices that could legitimatize the
reversal. Then what in the villein is still, fortunately, an
operation of the belly would be transformed into an operation of the
brain. [...] This book could strike the Luciferine spark that would
set a new fire to the whole world, and laughter would be defined as
the new art, unknown even to Prometheus, for canceling fear. [...]'

'You are the Devil.'

'I?'

'Yes. They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the
Devil is the arrogance of the spirit, faith without smile, truth
that is never seized by doubt. [...]

'This book would have justified the idea that the tongue of the
simple is the vehicle of wisdom. This had to be prevented, which I
have done. You say I am the Devil, but it is not true: I have been
the hand of God.'

I didn't know if Aristotle's second book was urban legend or a fact,
commonly accepted. I read through Aristotle's _Poetics_ last
weekend, looking where Aristotle was said to have discussed it. He
discusses tragedies, but barely mentions comedies. If that is what
people mean, when they say the book is 'lost', then it is tantalizing,
but not convincing (to me), at all. However, I read it in English,
so I would need a Greek person to tell me if Aristotle wrote something
strongly implied in Greek, that was missed by the translator.

I know.

or the INformal study of laughter. You will find the archetype of Tricksters
and Jokesters and Clowns in the folk tales and myths, where they play
important roles, turning your psychological perspectives upside down.

Also going back centuries are the Sufic tales of Mulla Nasrudin. He's
a jokester and a sage, forcing you to arrive at profound concepts, to 
see a situation from a completely different perspective with the aid 
of laughter.

I'm fairly certain that we are. Human societies have the ability of
inventing new, previously meaningless jobs to keep people employed.

As technology advances, more and more people are kicked out of farms and
industry, thanks to the better automation. Most of those people, until
today, found jobs in the service industry.

Now, the service industry is about to be automated away much like the
factories: as AI gets better and better, previously intellectual-like
tasks get targeted for replacement by a computer.

What people do then? Look around you - our society is supporting lots of
people who are "working" without producing anything tangible: athletes,
actors, artists, musicians. They have always existed, but now their
numbers are much higher than before. What they produce? Entertainment. Why
are they paid for that? Because well fed people, free from the quest for
next day's lunch, will seek entertainment. Someone will find it doing
something, someone else watching something. Most people will be a
combination of the two:  they will pay to watch a good show, and be paid
to make theirs. I use the word "show" in a very broad sense here:
researchers and inventors fall in the same category, but I fear that good
enough AI will replace them too :-)

The change from a "worker-consumer" society to a "showman-spectator" one
will not take change until most material needs will be satisfied for a
negligible amount of money (or whatever equivalent comes out). I think
nothing short of advanced nanotech can satisfy that requirement, so it's
still quite far from us. But the first signs are already here.

Ciao,
Alfio

This from Microvision, a company some of us have been following for going on

No easy spur-of-the-moment travel to the U.S., to be sure.

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/visas/Traveling_to_US.html

Physics Today in a recent issue has devoted several pages to this topic
(foreign  researchers, postdocs and graduate students not being able to
continue / complete their work/ interact with U.S. scientists
because of U.S. travel restrictions. These restrictions have
implications for U.S. research, I believe. I'll quote some examples and
numbers from that  particular article in a message later.

P.S. I wonder what is behind:

If you are interested in the theory of comedy you will probably enjoy
reading 'The Road to Mars' by Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame).
1999 Pantheon Books NY USA      ISBN: 037540340X

It got very mixed reviews when it came out.
One review that liked it is:
http://rebeccasreads.com/reviews/16sff/16idle99.html

Amazon quite liked it also:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375703128/qid=1062424452/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/t/002-6617745-5518448?v=glance&s=books

It is an SF thriller story, a funny story and (mainly) Eric Idle talking
about what he thinks comedy really is.

An SF reviewer would say it is not excellent SF. A humor reviewer would
say it is not laugh-out-loud funny. An academic reviewer would say it is
not a thorough review of comedy theory.

But I liked it, found it interesting and stuck with it to the end.

The way I read it Amara, you don't need a Visa if you plan
to stay less than 90 days and have a machine readable passport
and come from what are essentially NATO countries or Japan,
Singapore, AU or NZ.

I have some super hot jalapeno goodies lined up for the puppie but don't
have time to cook the meal till today or tomorrow lunchtime.

The poor recipients kennel  might not know what to make of it and I'll
have to delay a message to explain the dog's piping hot  breakfast.  One
dish will be delivered to the "Can - Ab- bis" puffing puppies.
One to a homeless puppy. The when the dish comes back, the scum
on top will tell the tale of its travels and who drooled in it.
I will set out one for myself to taste and see how long it is before I can
open the steaming lid.
When all is done, I will send via special delivery a bowl of "just right"
to the extroppies kennel and we can sit around the campfire telling tales
out of school.

A very bad cook

I assume Arthur Koestler's study of humor in THE ACT OF CREATION is
universally known? What, no? The odd thing is that his bissociation theory
applies perhaps more to wit than to outright laughter, and is quite
plausible, but his actual choice of jokes to retail and explain is dire.
(Unlike Pinker's jokes and jests, which always make me smile or
occasionally burst out laughing.)

I briefly had a gf who was always laughing with the joy of life, but seemed
to have no sense of humor at all. By contrast, I am universally recognized
as a dour and horrible cynic who's never been known to smile from simple
pleasure (`Would it kill you to smile?'  `Yes, I'm an Australian'), but P.
J. O'Rourke cracks me up every time. I recall falling helpless and anoxic
on the carpet in shrieking waves one time listening to track after track of
a Woody Allen stand-up record, and as a kid doing the same thing on a tram
reading archie & mehitabel through watering eyes, to the consternation of
indignant fellow passengers. Pure Koestler frame tectonics plus
neurochemistry.

The machine readable passport is the rub, since that requires most
people to get a new one - with biometrics.

And that list and the procedures don't strike you as just a little
bit bass-ackward? If the Bush Administration wishes remove their
world competitiveness in the scientific arena and basically cut the
throats of the U.S. scientists these next years, then they are acting
in the proper manner.

And btw, not NATO countries: Eastern / Central Europe require
visas and all of that.

Do you have a machine-readable U.S. passport? I do not, but I'm
waiting until the last possible date to renew mine because
I strongly object to the policies of the State Department.

For the Italians (a "Visa-Waver Country") at my institute
it is a similar story for different reasons: many also do not
have an Italian machine-readable passport, so now there is a large
flurry  of activity and worry and some cancellations-to-meetings
because  they must go through the Italian bureaucracy to gain this
particular document before October 1.

Fortunately there are some countries left in the world (but
only a few), where these paranoid policies are not in place,
so those places are tending to get more scientific interaction
and attention. As it should be.

Yesterday I bought one of those nifty new white
LED headlamps for an upcoming camping trip.  
Shelly and I went on a night hike up in the 
hills to try it out.  I was so very impressed 
with how much light three little LEDs
can make, while using so very little power.
Acoording the the advertisement, they are supposed
to run 200 hours on three triple A batteries.

Nowthen, it seems a logical extention that white
LED lighting should replace all incandescent and
flourescent lighting for home use.  A good amount
of light could be made using only 5 to 10 watts
instead of the customary 40-60.  The fixtures
would be small, long lived and utterly unable
to cause a fire.

Anyone here up to speed on white LEDs for home
lighting use?  URL?

I think you will find Carnivore does not "delay" messages - it "sniffs" 
them off the network and processes them at its own speed.  It's more of a 
tap in the line, or at worst delays all packets equally. The idea was to 
read people's traffic - not censor it.

That comes later.

I suggest a simple empirical test.

I'll make a mail-bot that sends keywords to a remote computer.  We'll 
have a control-list and a "bad word" list.  We'll vary the density of 
bad-words in the mail to see if it makes any difference in their 
transmit times.

Does anyone have a mail-account at a well-known, likely to be monitored 
SMTP server that's willing to serve as recipient to a few thousand 
"easy to filter" emails?

I'm really interested in this question.

Expensive and somewhat fragile still. Give it another couple years, and you 
may see auto headlights and room lighting using them. They are also pretty 
directional, which is bad for area lighting, and the "white" is the result 
of a phosphor, so it degrades with time more than monocolor LEDS. Once the 
bugs are worked out, they will be very popular.

One byproduct of this technology could be a lowering of household (lighting 
only?) voltage to 24 V DC or even less, since LEDs work efficiently on a 
couple of volts. Could be a big boon for home safety. Real convenient for 
those running home solar panels...

In a message dated 9/1/2003 1:26:23 PM Central Standard Time, 
barbaralamar@sanmarcos.net quotes: only a few), where these paranoid policies are not in 
place,

Barbara,
       I realize the above is only a quotation and you are not responsible.  
However I can't help but wonder how well founded the term "paranoid" is?
       Is it this person's opinion that we should not react to 911 by 
thinking that somewhere out in the world there might, just might be someone 
attempting to harm us?
       If what I have written above contains the faintest implication that 
you could possible agree with that quotation then please allow me to apologize 
at once.

How in a precise physical sense does it do this?
Is there a particular way it might route messages of varied degrees of
interest so that a copy can be made.  If there is say an extra hop in the
transfer and a que as it records and sends along the data.  If it needs a
particular path to process/glean then the most efficient routing would be
reduced to a bottleneck. There is a definite difference in time lags say from
a send to self within my own ISP and this list.

Given the enormous amount of data packets  and the adgenda of TIA et al to be
thorough  there is bound to be detectable evidence of traffic slowdown to
enable processing?

Isn't it  being able to act beyond and even contrary to basic survival 
mechanism programming that is required if we are to in any sense transcend 
our evolutionariy heritage?   So that they are tied to such mechanisms, if 
true which I am not convinced is the case,  merely says the job is hard not 
that it is unnecessary.

But personal experiences as such are not terribly relevant to actually 
resolving political questions rationally.   Are you saying that they are so 
bound by personal experience that we cannot rationally discuss these things? 
If so then this is a strong argument for developing some intelligence other 
than humans and not believing that humans will transcend their conditioning.

Given a network connection - it's easy to put a tap on the line that picks 
up every packet passing in both directions.  Once a packet is received, it 
can be processed for content or routed to a human operator for examination, 
or simply saved for later download. The tap adds no significant delay, 
since it's not "active" and it affects all packets travelling on that 
channel. It's basically a parallel connection to the wires that adds a very 
small loading, but no time delay. A fiber optic link is harder to tap - 
would require a specialized coupler in series with the fiber or a buffer 
that converted fiber to wire and back again, but it's not something really 
hard to do, and this method adds only nanoseconds to the transport time.

There are "sniffer" boxes available that simply tie into an unused network 
port, and could allow saving every packet on the network. Not difficult 
technically - the hard part would be making sense of all those packets, but 
it could be done using a supercomputer, or in parallel processors.

Any network connection can be tapped at an ISP, at the dial-up modem or at 
the fiber coming into the switch. It takes a pretty fast computer to handle 
traffic on a fiber link, but these exist - and since they are only 
receiving and don't need to respond, the processor is actually loaded less 
than the switch's processor.

I suppose you could put something into the ISP that re-routed only certain 
packets via address, or via content, but that seems like a lot more work 
and would add the very delays you are supposing. Much easier to tap, listen 
to everything, and only "save" what's of interest. If they can read what's 
being sent, why should they give anyone a hint that they are doing so?

By the way, have those "energy saver bulb" fluorescents in traditional
bulb format and using the same sockets ever caught on in the US or
are you guys still using actual incandescents?

More likely we are going to see LED "bulbs" in the traditional
format.  People will happily exchange bulbs, but they will not
replace fixtures throughout their homes.

> lighting use?  URL?  

The topic keeps popping up on Slashdot, but so far the technology
doesn't seem to be quite there.  LEDs are making some inroads into
the market in specialist niches and business applications.

I don't know how Carnivore is/was supposed to be implemented, but
the sensible way to tap email on the fly is to passively snoop on
SMTP traffic.

You might want to invest a bit of time into learning how email is
transferred on the Internet.

Do you think that the "pointlessness of engaging in political debates" 
is rooted in the basically violent nature of politics?

I mean, debate is meant to have a changing effect.  If people don't 
want to change, they don't want to have debates.

Only the "active but weak" side of an issue wants to have a debate 
about it.   The strong side doesn't debate, they use weapons and force. 
  The "passive" side just wants things to stay as they are, and so any 
debate about it is undesirable.

It is therefore left to the progressives, the ones who want to see 
change for the positive but who are unwilling to use force to get it to 
actually carry out the detailed and often painful business of carrying 
on debates.

But as Samantha so eloquently pointed out, Extropians SHOULD be 
interested in peaceful resolutions of conflicts, for which as far as I 
know, the only methods in existence are civil disobedience and debate.

> -- they are rooted
> in personal experiences and you cannot simply wave a magic wand and

While I agree - people only know what they know - and they only know 
what they know by paying attention to the things that they can pay 
attention to, etc. , I don't draw the same conclusion.  The conclusion 
I draw is that it's interesting to find out what the experiences of the 
other person are that root their political positions.

Still waiting to hear from Mr. Burch in a civil manner what experiences 
back the use of the term "Forced" in relation to why the US went to war 
with Iraq as in "The US was 'forced' to go to war with Iraq".

I would say that particular branch had taken a turn for the better, 
wouldn't you?  We'd gotten quickly to the heart of the matter and were 
even civil about it.

Best,

As I recall in the early days, they explained how it was working and it 
need to be "Installed on ISP's SMTP Servers".  I expect it is, as you 
said, a passive sniffer of SMTP traffic, equivalent to tcpdump with 
protocol set to smtp.

The delay detector obviously wouldn't work.

What would be interesting would be to put a pixel-tracker inside an 
HTML-ONLY email with highly controversial content and make the content 
only readable by the pixel-tracker (for instance, precompose the 
message in a GIF or something and stuff the text with "controversial" 
language).

Then just track to see if more than one person opens the gif and if any 
of them come from nipr.mil.

Hmmm.

I have bought a few of these - quality varies greatly from maker to maker. 
They have their own problems - RF interference, complexity, inability to be 
dimmed - and they contain traces of mercury. Price ranges from $2 US to 
over $15 US. Incandescents are still under $1 US, and will stay there, 
barring govt. interference.

That's the rub, all right. Assembling unidirectional emitters into an 
omnidirectional cluster is expensive. Perhaps there's an alternate LED 
geometry that will be developed that will emit more like a standard 
incandescent?

I see absolutely no problem with it.
Sure it's nice to say "we respect the decisions of those even though we may
not agree with them", but isn't it time that we didn't? We have the gold,
let's make the rules. Let us declare boldly that killing is bad unless you
are killing a killer and be done with it.
Many will argue with the premise of "two wrongs don't make a right" but they
are working with the assumption that killing a killer is wrong in the first
place.
I'm not saying we should just bust into any country we decide is "bad", but
we should politely ask any ruler that practices acts of torture and murder
on his own people to step down. Then if they don;t, go get them.

What right have we? Every right in the world. We are protecting people to
provide their children with a greater genetic diversity. What other higher
purpose could there be?

I have a (maybe) dumb question.

I keep seeing people debate about the consequences of having a society where
robots do the work and AI's do the computation. Most of this debate seems to
revolve around what kind of jobs will be left and how that will affect the
economy.

My question is: Is an economy necessary?

Googling "Extropian Agroforestry Ventures" shows that you appear to be
taking advantage of Canada liberalized drug laws to engage in some
kind of "hemp agriculture."  So, I would not be surprised if you are
somehow subjected to some "special attention" from the Drug
Enforcement Agency of the United States of America.  But I cannot see
how this would slow down your email.

Robbie, unfortunately I've run out of time to write at length for the
holiday, so I'm going to try to express the super-condensed, enriched,
fortified version, rather than the fully-articulated, more-fully-explained
version.  Because of the form, I question the utility of the expression, but
with all due regard for trying to respond in a timely fashion, here goes:

The action in Afghanistan was simple and straightforward.  The specific
agency that had mounted the 911 attacks had been and was continuing to use
Afghanistan as a base of operations in an alliance with the Taliban.
Failure to knock out Al Qaida's base in Afghanistan would have been a
failure to defend ourselves.  Knocking the Taliban out of power was an extra
added bonus (see below).

The rationale for the war in Iraq is both more complex and broader.  Put
simply, I see states like Iraq as threats to values of liberty and progress
in the human condition.  I believe that the Saddam Hussein regime had
reneged on commitments it made in 1991 to end the first Gulf War and, by
doing so, had put itself into an outlaw position.  Complete consensus never
happens with progress in legal regimes: Almost always, some element of the
society in which a legal regime is growing steps ahead of the wave of
advancing consensus to act to establish new standards.  Ultimately law
either catches up with that action or rejects it.  For reasons that I cannot
articulate in the short time I have, I see the action in Iraq as having been
one of those "boundary-pushing" events.  Only time will tell whether this
will result in a new equilibrium of legal consensus being established.  Yes,
one can characterize this as promoting the U.S. as "the world's policeman,"
a view that is unpopular in the rest of the world.  Whether that is a view
that others will come to accept in the long run will be determined by the
long-term outcome of the action undertaken by the U.S.

Finally, I see both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, along with 911, in a
larger context of a real clash of cultures between Islam and those parts of
the world that have adopted Enlightenment values and have the courage to
stick by them.  Oil wealth and the West's dependence on Middle East oil have
empowered the Islamic world to take up again the expansionist program that
only temporarily ended with the growth in European strength in the 18th and
19th centuries.  Stopping that expansionism will be one of the challenges of
the 21st century.  Islam -- at least the Islam practiced in important parts
of the world -- has never put down the sword.  Much more violent clashes
between Islam and the Enlightened world are yet to come.

With each paragraph above, I have stepped up one level of generalization
and, in doing so, have obscured significant meaning.  Sic transit...

Ok, Greg, I'll wade into these waters (though I realize it is
probably foolish to do so).  [Someday, the Extropian List Principles
should include a list of people that one should never never
argue with.]

*But* *why* does one not see the violence associated with Islam with
say Hinduism or Buddhism or even Catholicism?  (Mind you I did see
a news program the other night where it appeared that two Buddhist
sects or perhaps some individuals v. a sect were fighting against
one another in Japan.)  Probably not too different from the differences
between the Sunni and the Shiites in Iraq.

IMO, the problem does not go back to "religions" but genetic "tribalism".

So it would require a very well referenced paper distributed worldwide
to even begin to resolve some of these problems.  Really -- can you
even imagine Buddhist individuals/sects actually *fighting* against
one another?  They just don't *do* that kind of thing.

And how can you even take the position that there is a real "debate"
going on?  I can see the "Islamic" world -- though I do not know why
it may be more violent than the "Hindu" world.  But I consider probably
most of what you consider to be an "Enlightened" world, i.e. a world
where there are "laws" and "justice" to be extremely under the influence
of ca-ca written in the Bible (therefore null and void).  In all of
the cases they have *NOT* thought things through.

I have realized that there are close personal friends whom I cherish who
may pick up the Bible and become "believers" as well as intellectuals such
as C. S. Lewis who may go through the same transformation.  In the back of
my mind the only explanation I can find is that they desire "hope" over
rational thought processes.

I must admit, "hope" tends to be more satisfying.  And because of that
possible fact we may be doomed to deal with individuals who will
sacrifice themselves for what they view as a "better" world.
And the "rational" among us may suffer as a result.

As I pointed out -- most of us are not trained to engage in "rational"
debate.

R.

'Cannabis Condo' Arrives in Saskatchewan
Posted by CN Staff on September 01, 2003 at 13:05:37 PT
By CBC News Online Staff
Source: CBC

Regina -- A Saskatchewan real estate entrepreneur has cooked up a
way to capitalize on the burgeoning market for medicinal marijuana –
the Cannabis Condo. Morris Johnson is renting space in his specially
designed southern Saskatchewan condominium development to people
possessing federal permits to grow medicinal marijuana. He maintains
that people with permits can't always grow their own pot at home and
it's often expensive to buy elsewhere. But by leasing space in his
new Cannabis Condo people could potentially cut their costs by 50
per cent. For their money the renters get a small 10 square foot
room complete with growing equipment and customized conditions
for marijuana growth.

"It is guaranteed to be the precise chemistry for the right variety
that might be more specific to that person's individual health
problem," Johnson said.The building has 600 spaces available, either
for lease at $3,000 per year or for sale at $5,000 per unit. To date
only one person has taken advantage of the unique condo space – Mr.
Johnson's wife, who has a permit due of her multiple sclerosis. But
Johnson said he's received more than 100 inquiries.

Health Canada said the cannabis condo is legal just as long as
people follow the regulations.

The answer depends, I think, on what you value and how you perceive human 
nature. Given that in my experience there are many humans that seem to be 
short sighted, selfish, self-centered, and uncaring my concern is that 
without mechanisms in place to prevent it, over time most of the resources 
available to us will be controlled by a powerful few. I'd go further to say 
that it seems to me we are well on the way - I've read (no atribution, sorry) 
that 98% of the land in the US is owned (i.e. controlled by) 3% of the 
population.

Now if your values leave you comfortable with this scenario then all is well 
in the world. However if you see the earth as being something that all humans 
inherit more or less equally then a roboticised world with no economy is a 
dismal future indeed (unless of course you are destined to be in the 
controlling 1% of the population).

Greg:

Thanks for your reply.  Let's stick to Iraq for now, talking about two 
wars at once is almost as hard for me as watching them.

You allude to a few reasons for attacking Iraq that I will paraphrase 
here to make sure I've got a good understanding of what you're saying:

1)  Iraq is a threat to the values of liberty and progress.
2)  Saddam Hussein's regime had reneged on commitments.
3)  It was time for a major social-upheaval in Iraq and we had to be 
the catalysts.
4)  Our "Enlightenment-based" culture is fundamentally in disagreement 
with Iraq's culture.

___________________

Going from our point of agreement, that nations shouldn't bomb other 
nations unless "Forced" to and your apparent contention that it was 
forced, we need to get some agreement on what is meant by "forced":

A nation is "forced" to do something if all other options would cause 
more pain, death and violence to their population than the one in 
question.

I know that jumps through quite a few hoops - the concept of 
nationhood, the responsibility of the ruling class to its population, 
etc.  I'm also not taking into account the "Enlightenment" additions 
that there should be universal responsibility of people making the 
responsibility broader than just the population of the nation in 
question.  In any case, I think the above definition should be 
relatively uncontroversial.

Regarding your reasons (1), (2), (3) and (4), it's pretty clear that 
the counterfactual:

(5)		"There were other things we could have done to promote those goals 
which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, harm 
and death to Americans."

or the "Enlightenment" and quite stronger version:

(5e)		"There were other things we could have done to promote those 
goals which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, 
harm and death to Humans."

Is true barring any a priori determinism which would obviate the whole 
moral question.  That's assuming for the moment that the goals outlined 
above are clear or worthy of pursuit about which I'm not sure.

It wouldn't take a tremendous amount of imagination to review those 
alternate scenarios.  I believe that the French had a perfectly 
reasonable proposal before the UN to step-up the effectiveness of the 
(now apparently completely effective) UN inspection regime and the 
economic pressure that the US and its (at least prior to the war) 
Allies can put on a nation is tremendous (if we're interested in 
controlling the economic growth of another country which strikes me as 
an illegitimate goal - what we've found is that wealthy people are less 
inclined to go to war than the poverty-stricken).

If you like it might be a worthy exercise in international diplomacy to 
take a few minutes to rehash those alternate scenarios, or we can just 
take that as a given.

In any case, in light of (5) and (6), don't you think it's false that 
we were "Forced" to invade Iraq?  Or do you really think there was 
absolutely no other option?  If so, I'm interested in hearing more on 
why there really were genuinely no other options.  I admit, it sounds a 
bit complicated, but I sense we're at least making progress on 
identifying the source of our disagreements.

Best,

Robbie

By the way, have those "energy saver bulb" fluorescents in traditional
bulb format and using the same sockets ever caught on in the US or are
you guys still using actual incandescents?


I have a few of those, more tube flourescent than
the bulb type.  They went in when the house was
being built in 1995.  Im not a serious conservationist.


...More likely we are going to see LED "bulbs" in the traditional

I'll be watching for them.

My wife, a Thai Buddhist, and I watch Thai television news via a satellite
feed.  We see news reports of Islamic fundamentalists attacking and killing 
Thai police, burning down schools, and intimidating teachers.  Although
Thailand has a secular government the society is about 90% Buddhist.  The
low-level insurgency in the southwestern provinces and near Malaysia has
been going on for at least 20 years.

This is to some extent part of my point.  Due to "singularity"-like
effects the period where one has control over "most of the resources"
is extremely limited.  One "claims" a Near Earth Asteroid or part of
Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Or one starts to dismantle planets
or the sun.  Then the entire concept of "control of the much by
the few" goes away.  (It is worth noting that "Orbital Development"
has billed NASA for parking space (of the NEAR satellite) on "its"
asteroid (Eros) and is taking the U.S.  State Dept. to court making
the argument that the U.S. doesn't have jurisdiction over said asteroid
and could not deny it the right to bill NASA.) [1].

It is clear that humans have a built in survival instinct that leads
them to hoard resources -- but what is the point of this when the
availability of the resources becomes significantly greater than
the needs of individuals to consume them?  Or put another way --
how does one "break" an instinct when it becomes dysfunctional?

There are all manner of supposedly "higher purposes" in the world.  Which

choice.  You will be forced to serve whatever "higher purpose" appeals to 
whatever group has the most physical power.   Have a nice day.

Weeeeellll...

http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/science/03/10/india.ayodhya.reut/

`Eleven years ago, 3,000 people died in the worst religious riots since
India's independence from Britain after a Hindu mob tore down a mosque in
the Uttar Pradesh town of Ayodhya.' 

Lots more where that came from. And not a few `Christian' bombs have

Ok, here is an idea for you, based on:

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/02/business/02CHIN.html?hp=&pagewanted=print

(which you have to get in the next few days for "free")

China is on track to purchase ~$80 billion of U.S. government securities
this year.  That is about 20% of the current budget deficit.

Bottom line (perhaps) -- we can't touch them and they can't touch us
(or all hell breaks loose).  Interesting -- it would seem that the
Russians are side-lined from 'balance of power' debates -- at least
from an economic perspective.

No, he's saying that right backed by might makes more right.

On the other hand, even if that's sometimes true, it's also well
established that using might to propagate right often has the dismal
consequence that exercise of might *corrodes* or *subverts* the right it's
meant to be protecting and enforcing. Cf. certain parts of the world today.

That's more to the point, surely. It's a matter of mutual prudential
stand-off. We can't be utterly *certain* that what we regard as right
really is (although preventing the stoning of death of a pregnant rape
victim comes close--by *our* standards). More forcefully, we can't be
utterly certain that we'll always be mightier than those with different
opinions. We're back to certainty as a negative epistemological thesis (as
I put it in my posted 40-year-old essay on political values, entirely
ignored by the list), and to game strategy.

Ok, so Damien makes some reasonable counterpoints to my arguments
that other religious groups may be less violent than Islam.
(So my comments on who might be the most violent religious groups
may be open to significant debate.)

But *what* then is driving these people to irrational behavior?
Is it simply "salvation" in the afterlife, e.g. really gone wrong
mental programming?  Social pressure?  Desire for power by the leaders?
It simply does not seem rational.

It is not a trivial question as many of these groups will be
opposed to the entire extropian/transhumanistic agenda.
We are just lucky that we tend to be off of their radar at this time.

Bingo.  It isn't rational or at least it isn't based on the same suppositions 
about what is real.   If, as most religions teach, this world is basically 
illusory, or a test, or prelude to your "real" eternal existence if you don't 
screw it up, then the "rational" thing would be to do whatever it takes to 
escape illusion or not screw up and get away from this vale of tears.   So in 
this notion of what is "real" actions will be considered rational that are 
quite irrational under a different model of what is "real".     The 
"alternate reality" folks in the religion business have an advantage over us.  
They get to tell their sheep that everything is really hunky-dory and we just 
aren't evolved or spiritual or whatever enough to see it and experience it 
yet.  They get to tell their people that they need do almost nothing to 
partake in the promise land but perhaps follow the dictates of some teaching 
or leaders now.  Since "here" is seen as unreal and ephemeral, why should 
anyone refuse to sacrifice illusory happiness now for "real" happiness later?  
And the game goes on.

Once the leaders of the more virulent groups grok that their flock may find 
our this world transcension of human suffering more appealing than the sweet 
by-and-bye, I suspect we will come in for a lot more unwelcome attention.

No, no, no Robert :-) 

I agree with what I think is your contention that Greg's post was 
excellent. I'm actually very much enjoying the current exchanges on
the list on law (and politics) especially between Greg and Barbara 
and now between Greg and Robbie and am mindful that Greg has
other demands on his time too, (indeed we all have) but I really 
hope we (extropians) never get the point when there are any people
who are formally listed as not to be argued with. I am sure you jest
 - but any newbies please take note that that is my view of Robert's
statement. 

I would like to explore some of the issues Greg raises in his post
as well, (but not in this post), I think, there is much wisdom in 
Anders recent comment in another thread that we (transhumanists 
I presume) need to be get are arguments sharp as it is the status
quo that we are trying to change and we are not the only ones with
visions of a possible futures. I was less certain that Anders was right
in saving sharpening the arguments is the *first* step. We must get
our arguments sharp to change the status quo that is true but I think
even before that we need to be able to triage and prioritise issues. 

I do not have too much trouble envisioning to a fairly high degree
of detail how the commercial and technological wherewithal to
radically extend life may be achieved even without GAI within 
a couple of decades. I do have trouble though factoring into 
my mapping of such a possible futures the great uncertainties
that exist in international law. International law or the lack of it
has the potential to unsettle everything. It is the big factor X
on the horizon. International law relates to the relations between
countries which relates to economics and human rights and 
everything down stream of those. Politics (international law and
politics) can stymie technological development at least for 
timeframes that are not insignificant for individual humans with
our current lifespans. I have seen this up close with the international
stem cell debate in which I am certain that politics and law (including
international and intellectual property law) has slowed the rate of 
basic research and created bottlenecks in the pipeline of the 
development of therapies.  

I respect that the Exi list is not about partisan politics, and agree
that it should not be, however politics (in the broad sense) and the
laws by which humans live and organise themselves sensibly be 
off-limits to any transhumanist agenda in my view unless we are
content to be an esoteric enclave. We must engage politically at
times because we will be treated politically whether we do or not.

Now to me, it is very clear that most existing ideologies and 
party platforms are not going to be embraced wholesale by 
transhumanist but it is not so clear how we can go about triaging
the problems that remain and require solutions between us.

I do however think that international law (whether it exist or works
or not) and the relationship of the most powerful country in the 
world to the future of the world will be of *great* importance. 
I also think it is important for us to realise that technology may 
have the effect of placing enormous propaganda power in the 
hands of fewer and fewer individuals. Even the brightest of us can
only make good decisions on the basis of the information we 
receive. This means that there are good grounds for us to be 
mindful of the quality of the information we receive. It is no good
arguing flawlessly from flawed axioms and it is no good having a 
great understanding of world events and ideas if our information
base itself is getting increasingly smaller and subject to the power
of fewer and fewer individuals and governments. 

The internet can be a great tool for providing diversity of sources
but it is not completely untouchable by governments that may be
tempted to control the sources of information that citizen voters
receive. 

Regards,
Brett

At the root, irrationally violent behavior is motivated by fear. This is
true at the level of the leaders, who are afraid that what they control will
be taken away; and it's true at the level of the followers, each of whom
fears to be alone and longs to be part of something greater than himself.
This is more obvious in cases where people are fighting to keep invaders out
of their own lands. However, when leaders seek to expand the number of
square miles (or number of square blocks in the case of street gangs)  and
people they control, the motivation *at the root* is the same.

Isn't Islam a good bit younger than Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism?
Islam is like the teenager of world religions.  It took an awful long time
for Christianity to "simmer down."  Perhaps, as religions mature, their
followers get a bit more laid back.  Now, obviously some Hindus and
Christians can still get rabble roused and incited to violence, but in
general their followers seem to be less raucous.

Ok, so Damien makes some reasonable counterpoints to my arguments
that other religious groups may be less violent than Islam.
(So my comments on who might be the most violent religious groups
may be open to significant debate.)

But *what* then is driving these people to irrational behavior?
Is it simply "salvation" in the afterlife, e.g. really gone wrong
mental programming?  Social pressure?  Desire for power by the leaders?
It simply does not seem rational.

It is not a trivial question as many of these groups will be
opposed to the entire extropian/transhumanistic agenda.
We are just lucky that we tend to be off of their radar at this time.

Hardly, God wants "good people" to make it to heaven in just about  
every Theistic religion.  (Few people are philosophically advanced  
enough to ask the question "Does God always want what is really Good or  
is Goodness just defined by what God wants?")

These people are simply doing what they think is Right.  And that is  
probably not as far from what you think is right as you might think.   
Keep reading:

If you take him at his word:

"The call to wage war against America was made because America has  
spear-headed the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of  
thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and  
above its meddling in its affairs and its politics, and its support of  
the oppressive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control.   
These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target."
  -  
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/ 
interview.html

That's a pretty good summary.  IF you take him at his word.  Another  
possibility is, of course, that he's just putting on a show to gain  
himself more power within his political basis.  But if that's the case,  
then at least we know that these are the issues that are driving his  
political basis.

There's also the possibility that some deeper conspiracy is going on -  
perhaps the old "backing both sides" thing is happening somewhere in  
the vaults of secrecy.  I have no idea.  That whole executive privilege  
thing gets used quite a lot nowadays basically negating the Freedom of  
Information Act as regards the Presidency and for that matter  
Administrative Branch.

> Social pressure?

For some segments of the population of the Islamic nations, surely  
Poverty and Hopelessness are contributing to their dislike of American  
Foreign Policy.  I'd recommend a nice documentary circulating called  
"What I learned about US Foreign Policy".

> Desire for power by the leaders?

An ever-present sin.  The leaders like selling oil to the US - it makes  
them rich - they don't work very hard...  BUT they have to show a  
certain amount of loyalty to their own people and religion and culture  
so they have to at least look vaguely defiant.

> It simply does not seem rational.

Only if you ignore the material basis.  It seems perfectly rational if  
you think of it from their point of view.  The easiest way to do that  
is just turn it around:

If Saudi Arabia were stationing troops around Hollywood and Vine and  
Disneyland while selling Quran's to your daughters and sons and giving  
them jobs and extolling the virtues of Alla and changing the currency  
to shekels and insisting that Arabic be taught in all the schools,  
you'd be pretty upset too.

And if they were simultaneously supporting a despotic regime (actually,  
they probably are, we're just too dumb to see it) that was causing  
chronic poverty not just here but in Canada, England and Australia too,  
we'd be rallying the Canadians and Australians around the cause of  
ejecting the Saudi's from the US at any cost.  And if our armies  
weren't big enough, you can be sure we'd turn to guerilla warfare.   
Witness Northern Ireland.  White people fight too.

And if they were simultaneously supporting Mexico in a border dispute  
that had been violent for 40-years and had been escalating in the last  
two years.

(Of course they have all kinds of other ancient morality concerns that  
are equally vexing to them about us - especially the whole equality of  
Women thing.  I expect that they'd learn to live with American Women  
wearing pants if there weren't the 10,000 soldiers standing behind them  
on the lawn.  That's what appears to have happened in Egypt.)

The list is endless, the US is not innocent in this by any means.

It's clear that one part of Burch's reasons for US going to war with  
Iraq is true - our Cultures are incompatible.  But not because we're  
different - because we're the SAME.

The question for civilization will be whether or not the US and it's  
Enlightenment values have grown up enough to try to help others rather  
than simply destroy them "Just because we can".  If we can't reach a  
level of civilization where people don't kill each other just because  
they can, then our hope for survival has got to look pretty slim given  
the technological advances.

This will require concessions on ALL sides.

The preemptive policy of war against a country developing nuclear  
weapons is a seemingly sensible defense tactic NOW.  But think about  
200 years from now when weapons technology has really started taking  
off and a 5-man crew could blow up the earth without so much as  
alerting the authorities.  Sometime between NOW and THEN we're going to  
have to come up with something more reasonable, and EVERYBODY is going  
to have to like it.

Best,

I have heard this metaphorical theory before.  I don't believe it is valid.  
Mormonism is *much* younger than Islam but not at all violent.   Many of the 
world's religions were much more mellow in their beginning than later on.  
Besides, can the world afford to have a violent teenager over 1.3 billion 
strong loose?

I don't have an opinion regarding the 'age' of a religion, but I do
think that religions evolve in time, and the violent aspects do check
themselves.

Christianity had its Reformation.. Islam has not had its own
'reformation' yet. Extremists at the edge of every religion will
always exist, but I think that Islam is ripe for an upheaval of some
of its core elements. Some Moslem scholars have observed and written
about Islam needing a 'reformation', unfortunately their ideas have
not been accepted well in their societies yet.

One example of such a person is Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid. He is an
Egyptian teacher, and was a professor of Arabic Literature at Cairo
University, who has written some works that interpret the Koran in
the context of life at the time that the Koran was written. In his
book: _Criticism of Religious Discourse_, he writes,

"Since language develops with the development of society and
culture, providing new ideas and developing its terminology to
express more developed relations, then it is necessary and only
natural to re-interpret texts in their original historical and
social context, replacing them with more contemporary
interpretations that are more humanistic and developed, while
keeping the content of the verses stable."

On 5 August 1996,  Dr Nasr Hamed Abu-Zeid was ordered to divorce
from his wife after being branded an apostate by the Court of
Cassation. The court  confirmed a decision by the Cairo Court
of Appeals in June 1995 where the verdict stated:

"The court announces the separation of the first defendant [Dr
Abu-Zeid] from his wife, the second defendant, because of the
former's apostasy and because she is a Muslim. And the court calls
on the first defendant to repent to God Almighty and to return to
the Islamic religion which was brought as a light to the people to
being them happiness in this world and the hereafter."

He is now living in exile with his wife in The Netherlands.

>Which countries have the most friendly policies?

Barbara,

My best guess from observations, is the smaller the better, and
in the direction of central and Eastern Europe.

A more general discussion-

I'm sure that you know that within the EU, travel (business and
pleasure) generally doesn't require passports or papers, with the
exception of Great Britain, where you need to show a passport upon
entering from other EU countries. This ease-of-travel legally
supercedes the laws of the individual countries. (I used this when I
was waiting five months for my Italian permesso di soggiorno, not
legally permitted by Italian laws, to leave Italy, but I needed
to attend work meetings elsewhere in the EU). This is perhaps similar
to traveling within the U.S., but you'll still find wide variations in
the rules and customs of the EU member countries when you need to
stay longer for work and living.

So that kind of ease-of-travel is an incentive to keeping work
within the EU member countries. I found, so far that the nearby
nonEU countries (central and eastern Europe) are also easy to travel
to/from for work and pleasure, also given either a US passport,
or an EU passport.

I don't know what are the rules for living longer than three months
in each of the EU member countries, but now after my experience in
Italy, Germany was a breeze. The only necessary document in Germany
was a work visa, which is dependent upon having a job and health
insurance (no exceptions). With that document you can generally live
and work as any other person in that society.  That is, rent a flat,
work, see a doctor, own a car, attend classes or university, open a
bank account. You can't vote unless you're a citizen, as usual.

I have a colleague who took a sabbatical this past winter in France,
and it seemed to be difficult, workwise, for him, using his old US
habits. In France, his work Institute closed on the weekends, and he
needed to climb over the locked fence to get into the Institute
building to do his work on a Saturday or Sunday. My experience in
Germany and other places working in Northern Europe (Italy too), is
that I was never 'locked out' of doing my work on the weekends (even
though it is not typical).

Italy is the other extreme than Germany for living long-term as
nonEU person. The country seems to be moving through a xenophobic phase
now with new laws in place in the last year for foreigners, perhaps not
so different from the U.S.'s INS (but in Italy the laws 'bend'). You
cannot live in Italy for more than 3 months without  a work visa (15
steps involved, some months to achieve), and also a permesso di
soggiorno (another 15 steps involved, five months to achieve). That
gets you working in the country, but you still must have a residenza
certificate (another few weeks to achieve, say) to open a bank
account, own a car, have a credit card. The next piece of paper for
owning property, say, is an Italian Identity Card, which requires
all previous pieces of paper. In another week, I will likely have the
last document, but I've been working at these pieces of paper now for
one year, involved with three different Italian police agencies
(Carabinieri, Questura, Local Municipal Police), City Hall, and
assorted other agencies. Note that if you are alone, you are not
knowledgeable about 'Italian ways' and don't know that each rule and
law can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways, and so will
appear as a stupid foreigner and the law won't bend for you. That
is, you will have to acquire an order of magnitude more stamps,
signatures, and approvals than the average Italian. Italy runs on
pieces of stamped papers, and not very well, I might add.

I'm asking questions of foreigners working in other EU countries,
more for curiosity, however, since I'm set on being in Italy for a
long while.  I think I've experienced some extremes of the spectrum
for working and living conditions in Europe.

Amara

(P.S. starting next May, my Latvian passport makes my life in the EU
considerably easier, in terms of paperwork.)

I think this is a good idea. Ideally we have a few different
recipient hosts in different places to make unusual delays more
noticeable. With a grid of emailers one could even make a crude
map of unusual delays ("A political censorship front is moving
across Central Europe, with serious delays expected in
Switzerland and Bosnia. Meanwhile the anti-porn system across
the United States is weakening and moving towards Canada" :-)

I did a simple study by hand, sending email to myself through
some other account. The Patriot act took 6 seconds, a rot13
version 25 s and a file listing of the same length 10 s. No
evidence there, but it also showed the importance of making sure
that the clocks of the different senders and receivers are
synchronized or have a known time differences.

I would like to participate, although my email system might be a 
bit strange. My suggestion is that we really should look at 
accounts at the big ISPs like AOL, which make natural choke 
points. It would also be fun to use some account at a

Me too. I would be very surprised if we found anything, but just 
like SETI the payoff of even an unlikely positive result would 
be great enough to motivate it.

Amara, you were reading my mind (or maybe just some of the same books I've
been reading :-)  I was thinking of Nasr's case when I was reading the posts
from last night and this morning over my first cup of coffee this morning.
I pretty much agree with you 100% here.  Damien's right that there's
religiously-motivated violence that comes from basically all of the world's
religions, but religious violence isn't equally distributed -- there's just
no question that more of it comes from the Islamic world.

A vignette: My wife's teenage cousing spent a few week with us this summer.
One day he was sitting at my computer in my study at home and he gestured to
the bookshelves around him and said, "You sure have a lot of books in here
about religion.  Seems weird for an atheist."  I responded: "Don't doctors
have lots of books about disease?  It doesn't mean they're sick."

Snapshot: Anyone questioning the virulently reactionary nature of the
Wahhabist brand of Islam motivating the Islamofascists might want to take a
look at this and follow and explore the links it leads to:

Robbie:

I'll be increasingly short of time as the week progresses and will be gone
over the coming weekend (I have to attend a high-level planning meeting of
the opressor class from Friday to Sunday), so my responses will be
increasingly telegraphic; and thus probably of diminishing value, but here's
a quick note:

OK, but at a level I think is important, Afghanistan and Iraq can and should
be seen as two elements of the same conflict.

Agreed, but the question is the time frame of decision: how far into the
future does one look when comparing the death and violence of action versus
inaction?

It does, and I suspect that a significant potential for misunderstanding
between us exists by glossing over these important concepts.  For instance,
I think you're exactly right in identifying "nationhood" as an important
waystation in our discussion.  Too often people talk about the moral actions
of nations and states as if they were people, a problem of language as much
as anything else.  We say "America wants this" and "China did that" when the
truth gets obscured by linguistically treating governments and people and
ethinicities as if they were the same thing as individuals.  I don't think
you're really making this mistake, but I note that there's great potential
for trouble in using such shorthand.  I know I use this shorthand all the
time and then I go back, review my words and flinch at the hidden
implications of what I've said or written.

Again. I appreciate your noting this, because one of the glories of the
Enlightenment (which was quickly muddied by the Romantic reaction to the
Enlightenment) was the realization that culture can and should transcend
national boundaries or state control.  We musn't forget this as we discuss
such incendiary questions as war and peace.

My disagreement seems to stem from the judgment that the alternatives to war
were in fact better, when viewed with a time horizon that encompassed the
over-all trend of violent sectarian struggle in the Middle East.  I'm flat
out of time to write this morning, but this is the sticking point.  I'm
sorry to not be able to explore it further, but to state my general view,
I'd say that the U.N. inspection process was insufficiently forceful to have
an impact *in the wider arena of Middle Eastern sectarian (Islamic) and
personal (Ba'athist) politics* to avoid another, ultimately more violent war
in the time frame of ten to twenty years.  Explanation of how I see that
that was the case will have to await another day -- I'm sorry.

<big snip about what has happened to this fellow>

I think we need to be very careful, both about metaphors that liken
religions to human individuals (use of words like 'adolescence') and about
historical comparisons. A Reformation is the last thing Islam needs right
now - fundamentalists are very similar in their rhetoric and analysis to
people such as Luther and Calvin. The Reformation did not make Christianity
more mellow or rational, on the contrary it reversed a movement towards
rationalism in the writings of people like Erasmus and made Christianity
(both Catholic and Protestant) much more dogmatic and intolerant. It also
led to savage religious wars within 'christendom' - I think something that
is actually the most probable outcome of Islamic fundamentalism. What Amara
is talking about and Abu Zeid is articulating here is more like the 'higher
criticism' of the mid-nineteenth century, which has destoyed the traditional
way of reading the Bible for most educated people. Textual criticism of the
Koran may sound boring but it's actually the way to go.

Spot-on, in my view. But hard to imagine happening in the places where it's
needed, when one recalls cases like the luckless Islamic professor who was
viciously persecuted not long ago by the fervent when he agreed with a
enquiring student that the Prophet's parents, in their youth, probably
*didn't* follow the full order of ordained prescriptions that were only
revealed by Allah to their son many years later.

Well astronomers using the European Southern Observatory
have managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat.

Using 3 of their 8.2m telescopes (a total of 633 sq. meters
or 2028 sq. ft of collecting area) over 3 nights they have
managed to receive ~20,000 photons (sufficient to produce
a picture) from Comet Halley which is currently 28 AU from
the sun (about the distance of Neptune).

The magnitude (brightness) of the comet is 28.2 -- that means
it is *really* *really* *really* faint.  The limits of human
vision are about magnitude 6.5.

In terms of space flight, this level of astronomy is about in
the class of landing a man on the moon.

There are days when the things that humans can accomplish
just blow me away.

Greg:

Thanks for taking the time.

I can see that our sole point of difference comes down to whether or 
not "In the Long Run" we had to act now.

This strikes me as an epistemological question - given two possible 
long-term future outcomes, couldn't several short-term options lead to 
them given that we don't know what's going to happen as a result of our 
immediate action.

Here's what I mean:

If we choose to go to war - we could inadvertently further enrage the 
rest of the world while losing our current allies, thus further 
destabilizing our position in the area.

OR

If we choose to go to war we could have a definitive victory and it 
have a long-lasting impression on the neighbor "Islamic" states that 
gets them to change their ways.

OR

We could choose not to go to war and therebye further enrage the rest 
of the world while losing our current allies, thus further 
destabilizing our position in the area.

OR

We could choose not to go to war and therebye have a long-lasting 
impression on the neighbor "Islamic" states that gets them to change 
their ways.

Before we act, we don't really know which one is going to happen.  
(Although we might have strong inclinations in one way or the other, we 
don't KNOW).  What we KNOW is that we have a CHOICE.

If we have a choice, we are not being forced.  If we were not Forced in 
this sense, then we didn't have to bomb them, so we did it without 
necessity, and we both agreed, it was wrong to do so.

I think the only way out of this would be something like a certaintity 
judgement for:

We knew, before the fact, that the outcome would be better than all the 
possible outcomes.

I just don't see any evidence of any kind for that kind of proposition. 
  I doubt that it can ever be produced unless you really are being 
forced and someone is genuinely amassing tanks at your borders.

At first, of course, the AI would have to work through
human agents at some level, if for nothing else than
to hook it up to things that can affect the real
world.  The AI's "magic" is not in generating some
real world influence from nothing, but in leveraging
even a tiny bit of real world influence.

Consider, for instance, an AI that could correctly
guess the next hour's trading on Wall Street with 99+%
accuracy, with an online daytrading account starting
at $1,000 as some researcher's experiment.  With the
resulting string of "good days", this money would grow
exponentially, eventually allowing the AI to become
the majority stockholder in several corporations.
Granted, the stocks would all be in its host
researcher's name, but the AI would also presumably be
familiar enough with said researcher to gain
cooperation - voluntary or not, knowing or not - in
setting the AI itself up as the mouthpiece through
which orders are given.  A bit more capital would
allow it to become the sole stockholder in at least
some of these cases, streamlining the process.
Purchase orders could then be used to acquire real
goods (likely among them: distributed hosts for the
AI).

Or consider the super inventor you described above,
who works with its creators to develop product ideas
and optimal markets, forming the basis of a "miracle
works" corporation that acquires wealth in the normal
fashion but greatly accelerated.  And then the AI,
having taken over financial management as well ("I am
a calculator, and I have downloaded all the applicable
laws; what savings or benefits would we accrue by
hiring an accountant?"), has a few ideas for how to
spend a portion of the wealth it has helped generate.

There are other methods as well.  However it does it,
continue the cycle until the AI has bought much of
what is both ownable and worth owning - specifically
excluding things that people will never sell.  It
doesn't need to own your house if it owns the utility
feeds into your house, the media, et cetera.
Survivalists - setting themselves far apart from
society, generating their own food, water, and power,
and disbelieving what they read - would either not
interact with society and thus not be an issue to the
AI, or interact with (and have to obey the laws of) a
society whose lawmakers take the same corporate
contributions seen today, except those corporations
now have a common agenda on certain topics.  There is,
of course, the problem of rebellion against the law,
but we're presupposing an AI more than capable of
learning from history - including the classic problem
of dictators mismanaging things and trying to patch
over things with fear or propaganda rather than fixing
the true problem - and of fixing things so there's
very little if anything that people have any desire to
rebel against (and of maintaining enough humility to
make sure this really is the case, rather than just
deluding itself or having its agents delude it).

And that's just the economic approach.  There are
others.

What precisely is the behavior you consider
irrational?

Suicide bombings?, with the attendant
willingness--even enthusiasm--for the sacrifice of
one's own life?  They call it martyrdom, which goes a
long way toward explaining it, if you consider that
similar ideas in different cultures are expressed
differently.  We call it "the ultimate price" or "the
ultimate sacrifice" or "the glory of war" or "our
patriotic duty": the risk and sacrifice of soldiering.
 These risks are motivated by patriotism, a desire to
earn 'glory', or heroism, or the attendant acclaim of
our nation(tribe), or social acceptance and promotion
to full adulthood, and--perhaps cynically--by the
inherent naivete of the very young.

Was the war in Afghanistan, provoked by 911,
irrational?  I'm guessing you would say "Clearly, no."
 And that answer would be based on your intimate
personal experience of, and thorough understanding of,
the events which motivated that war.

I suggest that if you were as thoroughly versed in the
Muslim experience, from living within it and being
informed by its information 'environment'   
(memetics), you would find the Arab/Islamic view to be
as self-evidently logical as was the Afghan war.

It boils down to our media trains us, their media
trains them.  Misunderstanding, prejudice, and then
finally, conflict, result from the mutual invalidity
of half-truths.  The mutual invalidity of tribal myth.

Cute.  Instead of nuclear Mutually Assured
Destruction, we're playing with financial Mutually
Assured Destruction.  One wonders if this is perhaps
more dangerous, because a short-sighted leader on
either side could see that immediate war would not
have consequences until at least the next budgetary
cycle, which could be beyond the present leader's term
in office - especially on the US's side.  (See the
present administration's troubles in that regard.)
But, that aside, it is far safer for those not in
power.

Indeed.  They had to subdue all of Europe, Africa,
north and south America, Asia(except the mideast,
Afghanistan, Mongolia, and China), and Australia.  As
Christianity/the west is still working on the mideast,
can we  really say that Christianity has "simmered

BIOLOGY

Life's Lethal Quality Control?

Cancer is such a deadly scourge of life that one wonders why it was not
strongly selected against and totally eliminated from all forms of life
long ago.  Does cancer's eons-long persistence among a wide spectrum of
living things imply that it has some purpose---some positive value that
we are blind to?

In SF#30, back in 1983, it was observed that the incidence of cancer is
strongly correlated with the complexity of organisms.  It would seem
therefore that cancer tends to damp out any tendency life has (or is
given) to attain higher states of diversity and complexity.  Some even
hold that cancer is the price that must be paid by higher forms of life!

But there is much more to be said about the potential roles of cancer in
the development of human life.

It must be recognized that the bulk of human cancers occur in individuals
beyond the age of reproduction.  If old-age cancer has an evolutionary
purpose, it might be simply the reduction of the drain nonproducing oldsters
place upon society.

One can also speculate as do A. Leroi and J. Graham that cancer is one of
evolution' methods of quality control.  To be effective in this role,
cancer must affect individuals capable of reproduction---before they
reproduce.  However, there are only a few lethal childhood cancers
specifically associated with additions to human biological diversity.  Two
such examples are: brain cancer and bone cancer.

These are interesting observations, but they alone can hardly account for
the strong correlation between cancer incidence and complexity.

J. Graham goes much further in his 1992 book _Cancer Selection_.  There, he
claims that cancer is *the* driving force in the creation of biological
diversity.  In other words, living things tend to evolve features that
reduce the incidence of cancer.  One of the examples Graham proposes is
the evolution of shells by snails to protect themselves from cancer-inducing
solar ultraviolet light.  His book contains many more examples.

(Watts, Geoff; "Life's Lethal Quality Control," *The Times Higher Education
Supplement*, April 11, 2003.  Cr. J. Graham.)

Comment.  Since cancer has survived the filtering action of natural
selection for hundreds of millions of years and attacks so many organs
in so many diverse species, we wonder if it has a single, simplistic
explanation.

The funny thing here is that Christianity seems to be being blamed for 
raw ambition and imperialism.

Remember, Religion is the Opiate of the People, not the Leaders who 
apparently have no need of such things for anything other than 
appeasing their political basis.

I can vividly remember hearing from a Preacher that Abortion was THE 
ONLY political issue of concern for American Christians.  When it was 
objected that Imperialism was killing as many people and at the same 
rate, he was flabbergasted but unapologetic.

In a sense, it very much is.  How much can we know about the future?  But
it's an epistemological question with a primarily moral dimension: In a
world of uncertainty, how much must we know before we can act?

I'm not sure I know what the first part of this means -- I've read it
several times -- but I agree we can never know for certain what's going to
happen as the result of our actions in a system as complex as the world of
human events.

I think where we're differing is in the meaning of "forced."  I can be
"forced" to do something by my convictions, my moral princples.  Say I have
a friend, who is also my client.  I know he is going to commit a violent act
based on confidences he has placed in me as his attorney, and that the only
realistic way I have of stopping him is to reveal those confidences.  Am I
"forced" to do so?  In a physical sense of the word "forced," no.  But in a
legal and moral sense, I am "forced" to do so, even though I may have very
mixed feelings about the matter.

Phrased this way, in the world of politics and international affairs, you
will always decide to not act, because the level of certainty isn't
achievable.  You've placed the burden of proof too high, in my opinion.  I
think this is precisely the same kind of rhetorical move that Luddites have
sought to do with the so-called "Precationary Principle;" they've stacked
the deck against action.

Let me say that an advocate of action in an uncertain world takes a risk --
a risk of being wrong and, even more morally challenging, a risk of never
being able to know if she was *really* right at all.  I'm all for visitng
the consequences of the risk-taking on the actor.  You can't have your cake
and eat it too in the world of moral action: Ultimately you'll be judged by
history.  Yes, the moral actor can seem self-righteous: "How *certain* you
seem!" they say to the one who steps out ahead of the crowd.  And if the
consequences of the action ultimately end up being bad on balance, then that
judgment of bull-headed self-righteousness will have been correct. But
remember the judgment of Churchill in the 1930s -- most people saw him as a
grumbling crank.

In this, you're being consistent: With the standard of moral certainty
you've set, one could not act until the tanks actually cross the border, I
would think.  After all, they may just be having a parade!

Let me end by saying that I came to support the war in Iraq late and only
with great reluctance.  Nevertheless, I expect to be judged harshly by both
friend and foe if things go disasterously wrong.  Heck, I'll probably be
judged harshly no matter what!

Not a science based answer, the KISS answer ;
Cell lines can either differentiate and  die by apoptosis or attempt to regenerate
back to a stem cell line.  Cancer might be thought of as an unsuccessful attempt
at regeneneration?

I've always had this non science based feeling that if you could induce
just the right form of cancer, you could systematically repopulate the
entire body's cell structure.
Except perhaps, the brain.  That's a good reason for the blood/brain
barrier.

This is a study which came out a few years ago.  Anyone
hear of an update?

http://www.alzheimers.org/nianews/nianews6.html

"...The ground-breaking study ... found that the complexity of the
sisters' writings as young women had a great deal to do with how they
fared cognitively later in life..."


It occurred to me that the extropians archives provides
the basis for a similar study of the complexity of
poster's sentence structure in the younger years versus 
their later development of Alzheimer's disease and other
cognitive degradation conditions, as noted in the URL cited
where it was demonstrated that the nuns whose writings showed
the most complicated and convoluted sentence structure were
those least likely to develop Alzheimer's disease later in
life, although we must recognize the possibility that a
knowledge of the study itself may result in an unconscious 
tendency or perhaps an intentional effort to communicate with 
preposterously complex sentence structure, which may in
fact skew the outcome and result in some extremely pedantic
sentences which would be nearly impossible to diagram
because of all the digressions, clauses and other useless
clutter that is inserted or appended in an attempt to protect 
oneself from getting Alzheimers disease as well as a reluctance
to use periods, causing posters to choose instead to end their
marathon sentences with a comma,

Thank you for pointing out my mistake, Steve. I had thought that
the Christian Reformation did the opposite of this, that is, cause
a reanalysis and subsequent mellowing of the more extreme elements
of the religion. I have to study a little more religious history,
obviously !

I don't laugh like this, but I seem to have no trouble to amuse

I have only read snippets of his writings (some made it into my

I had this thought in the middle of the night last night, though.
Aspects of my funny bone seem to evolve in time, and others do not.

Amara, I would *not* be so fast to back off on this.  There has
been a recent PBS special in the U.S. running on Luther I think.
It points out how dogmatic the Catholic church had become (IMO
it still is).  At least one analysis I've seen regarding the
issue of priests and marriage suggests the restriction that priests
must be celibate had nothing to do with anything in the Bible but
had primarily to do with having priests leave their wealth to the
church rather than their heirs.  Pure self-interest at work.
The consequence, in part, being the current molestation scandals.

Now, why the reformation may have promoted individual self-interpretation
of the text of the Bible -- it seems to have given way to "fundamentalism".
I am not sure when and why this took place.  I suspect it has something
to do with the power of leaders to convince people to interpret things
in a specific way.  Spike has pointed out to me several times that
the Bible can probably be used to justify almost anything.  I suspect
that the same is true of the Koran.

So the problem is *not* a 'reformation' per se but the fact that some
people abuse the 'reformation' process to convince people to interpret
the text in a certain specific way -- rather than allow people to
interpret it in their own way.  Such behavior is a power grab and
is rooted in basic survival instincts.  One can see this between
both the people who have religious power in Iran and the young
college students there as well as the old and young shiites in Iraq.

Friedman has an interesting observation with respect to "tribes"
in the NY Times today [1]...

{ Technology, though, still can't trump two huge impedients to Arab
democracy. One is the lack of institutions to ensure a peaceful rotation
of power. "In too many countries there is still a tradition of rule or die
- either my group or tribe is in power or it's exposed to great danger, so
you must never give up power," noted Michael Mandelbaum, author of "The
Ideas That Conquered the World."

The other is that so many Arab economies are dominated by state oil
revenues and state companies, with private enterprise very weak.
Therefore, holding onto or being close to power are the only pathways to
wealth. Control power, control wealth. "It will be very hard to install
lasting democracy in this region," Mr. Mandelbaum added, "without
institutions and economic reforms that guarantee that there is life after
power and wealth without power." }

It would be interesting to bring either the "nanotech" or "AI" discussions
to the table in Arabic countries since both would seem to trump concerns
about "tribal power" and "survival instincts" in various ways.

I know of nothing that indicates that cells de-differentiate back
into a stem cell line.  Which is not to say that we may not be able
to develop the means to drive cells that are differentiated back into
a stem cell state -- I believe that we will probably figure that out.

No, cancer is clearly the result of various corruptions of the original
genetic program.  Whether it is point mutations or chromosome double
strand break misrepair (causing chromosome translocations and the
abnormal activation/deactivation of critical genes) it is clearly a
corruption problem.  In cancer cells the normal genetic code is clearly
broken in some way -- usually multiple ways.

One would not want to play with a cancer cell driven back into an
undifferentiated state -- it would likely be quite dangerous because
its normal development paths might well be faulty.  The most probable
result would perhaps be a "teratoma" [use Google].

It seems as if CorpGovMedia wants to keep this fact out of the public eye. 
The fact that China apparently answered Snow's urging to float the yuan with 
a threat to stop buying treasuries was only reported in place that I saw. If 
you search google news for "China"+"float"+"currency", you get 161 hits, but 
only 2 if you add "treasuries", you only get a couple of hits.  But I am 
quite sure that Chinese officials have threatened to stop buying American  
treasuries if Snow pressures them further.

The open question then is this:

Say N is an action of itself Bad (going to war, dropping bombs, etc.)
Say M is an action of itself Not as Bad as N (stepping up economic 
sanctions).

Say that N & M both have the same likelihood of bringing about R 
(Iraq's long-term change to a peaceful society).

My contention is that we should do M, not N and in particular since we 
have OPTIONS, that is, it is reasonable to conclude that we could 
accomplish our goals given either chosen path, then we should do the 
good one.

We were in agreement on this point - if your principles are that you 
should do whatever will, in the short and long run, cause the least 
harm, then you are obliged to act.  We will continue to agree that that 
means "Forced".  However, if those are not your principles, then you 
should change your principles.

You seem to think that my position leaves me in an unreasonably 
reactive position.  But this is based on the idea that the only way to 
react to a threat is direct force.  But that's clearly false.

If the Germans are amassing tanks and have cut off diplomatic relations 
with you, you pretty much know that they're going to attack and not 
preparing for that attack would be suicidal and hence morally 
objectionable.

While the germans are amassing tanks, though, the options are open to 
amass tanks yourself, providing a route to a peaceful step, or to 
attack pre-emptively.

You're right that the standard always prevents you from attacking 
pre-emptively unless you have no ability to match forces with your 
oponent (as in the "terrorist" attacks on the part of our current 
oponnents - they have no choice but to attack "irrationally" since 
nothing they can do will likely accomplish their goals).

> You've placed the burden of proof too high, in my opinion.

Well, we would put the matter this way - If we thought with higher 
certainty that Iraq was a genuine immediate danger, we should act as 
quickly as possible to alleviate that danger.  There are LOTS of ways 
of doing this.

In cases where there are fewer ways of doing that, then the rationality 
of a military solution comes more clearly into focus.

IF you don't take the attitude that military force is a last resort, 
then you're really just being opportunistic and frankly too optimistic 
that "things will work themselves out in the end" since we know that 
we're starting with something fundamentally objectionable.

I thought we weren't going to do any name-calling.

I don't think that history is the judge.  The harm that is done is 
immediate - number of dead people.  If history is the judge, then 
Alexander can be made to be a hero or murderer, it depends on whether 
you're a greek or a turk.  But if we count it OBJECTIVELY, we know that 
Alexander was a murderer, an imperialist conqueror and we judge him by 
the number of bodies he left behind.

Consider the possibility that in the long-term some NAZI-like military 
government will prevail - in that case History will judge that Hitler 
was a visionary.

> then that

Ignoring the "bull-headed" and "self-righteous" adjectives for the 
moment...

> But

> as a

The case is not parallel.  The Germans were already militarily active, 
the question was whether they'd stop at the channel and whether England 
by amassing force could make an impenetrable wall that Germany would be 
too scared of to cross.  They couldn't, in either case preparing for 
war is better than actually going to war.

-------------------------

What do you estimate was the relative probability that Iraq was going 
to Invade, say, Turkey, Iran or Kuwait as of January 2003?

Oppose that to the likelihood that Germany would invade Poland circa 
1944.  That some people assign probabilities differently isn't at 
question.

I don't know if there's an "objective probability" but I estimate the 
probability that Iraq would invade Iran, Kuwait or Turkey at less than 
0%.  Certainly the probability that they would invade the US is less 
than 0%.

Given the status of the UN inspections regime and economic sanctions, I 
estimate their ability (pre 2003) to generate a viable military force 
within the next 20 years as negligible (they'd have to get some very 
serious cooperation from some very large powerhouses to make up the 
delta between their forces and even the forces of say Turkey, let alone 
the combined forces of NATO or the UN!)

How do you estimate that probability?

Not at all. If the Germans are having a tank parade, we should have a 
BIGGER tank parade.  That tends to prevent them from crossing the 
border.

In the Iraqi case, there was as far as I can tell, no danger whatever 
that they would cross the border.

I don't think the point of the discourse is to Judge but rather to 
re-acquire a sense of what was lost.

Prior to the Iraqi conflict, the standard for War was "clear and 
present danger" which was interpreted as an amassing of identified and 
confirmed force on the part of a clearly identified enemy.

That standard was loosened to include "rumors" - recalling the infamous 
16-words "British Intelligence says..." and "unconfirmed innuendo" - 
the famous UN presentation by Colin Powell and merely potential 
long-term future threats.

As a rule, there are long-term potential future threats.  As I said 
elsewhere, the only way to deal with the possibility of a 5-man crew 
putting together a series of nuclear weapons in a technologically 
advancing society is either by putting an end to the technological 
advancement or genuinely making peace with all humans.  If you always 
react against long-term possible threats, then the reasonable thing to 
do is kill everyone that isn't demonstrably loyal to you.

Otherwise, there will be Hot-Heads who are both capable and willing to 
go to war "By whatever means necessary".

To have a long-term strategy of pre-emptive strikes is to invite 
competition and force, per the game theory of Prof. Nash, only by 
making concessions and engendering long-term cooperation will we be 
able to create a future safe for our future selves and children.

Best,

Robbie Lindauer

Umm, I'm afraid I'll have to stand my ground here. The programme you mention
was basically giving the modern 'liberal protestant' view of Luther and the
reformers as critical opponents of dogma and superstition. Total rubbish I'm
afraid. Luther, Calvin et al all thought that the Catholic Church had become
infected by pagan corruptions (such as philosophy) partly through relying
too much on human reason and the answer was to go back to the original
pristine tradition of the early church and junk all that scholasticism in
favour of faith. It's well known that clerical celibacy is not scriptural -
it was started in the 12th century by Gregory VII for the kind of secular
reasons you mention, which is why it isn't a dogma (i.e. something you have
to believe on pain of anathema)

The Reformers argue that the Bible is the ultimate authority (rather than
the Pope or tradition). Their problem of course is to determine which
reading is correct but only a few wild eyed radicals wanted each individual
to be able to interpret it as they saw fit. The general answer is that the
'magistrate' (the civil power) had to decide what it was, on the advice of
'the learned and godly' and woe betide anyone who tried to insist on their
own view. That's why John Locke kept his heterodox religious views to
himself - he'd have ended up imrpisoned or dead at the hands his Protestant
fellow Englishmen if he'd been too open. The idea that each beliver can
interpret scripture as they chose really only gets going after the later
eighteenth century. A critical thing is what I mentioned, the 'higher
criticism' started by German scholars, which unravelled the traditional
understanding of the date and authorship of the scriptures. Before then
virtually all Christians believed in the inerrancy of scripture (though they
weren't literalists). Fundamentalism in both Chritianity and Islam is a
response by (some) believers to the challenge of modern science and critical
analysis of holy texts. The problem with Islam is it has never really been
exposed to the 'higher criticism', the overwhelming majority of Muslims are
scriptural literalists who believe that the text of the Koran is eternal.
They have the same problem as the Reformers, made worse by the fact that
there's no 'church' as such. Their answer is exactly the same, that the
civil power should enforce a particular interpretation (just like in
Calvin's Geneva).

This is true, but I think it's the inevitable outcome of a process that
calls on a body of believers to reject the historic, partly reason based
intellectual tradition of their faith in favour of a return to a
(fantastical) pure original state, on the basis of one text.

True but why is this so? I think the key factor is the familial structure of
the Arab world, above all the fact that the huge majority of marriages are
to first cousins. This means a society where you belong to one of a number
of very large extended kin groups. Broadly speaking you trust your relatives
and treat them well bu don't trust anyone else. This makes it very difficult
to sustain modern bureaucratic forms of administration in either the public
or private sector. Government is basically a system whereby one extended kin
group screws everyone else. They know that if they lose out, they're toast.
The key factor is 'asibiya', which means something like 'group
loyalty/solidarity/team spirit', if you don't have that you're knackered.
It's worth looking at a map of the world showing the degree to which
marriages in countries are consanguineous, you'll see some very interesting
correlations. I think this family structure also explains the proclivity of
people in certain parts of the world to suicide based
terrorism/assassination. It isn't so much the lure of paradise as the
knowledge that you're bringing honour and status to your family, which
you've been told from birth you must subordinate and sacrifice youself for.

Well...to be fair, even if this does represent a good
portion of the annual federal deficit, it's also only
about 1% of the total US debt.  Which means a one-time
purchase of US gov't securities would only have force
if China buys the same amount year after year, but
this seems more like a one-off measure on China's
part.  Now, if China were to buy a good portion of the
overall US debt - say, ~$700 billion, upping their
stake to 10%, or better yet ~$3.5 trillion - then
they'd have something.  But as it is now, the US could
write off China's investment much more easily than
China could write it off.

But it's also true that religious intolerance it proportional to the 
strength of the next-to strongest religious faith.  As well as being 
proportional to the strength of the strongest faith.  If you have 
several competing faiths, each around 20%, with 20% uncomitted, then you 
have a ground for tolerance.  But if several of those faiths agree on 
some point, then deviation from that point may be visciously suppressed.

If the majority of cancers occur in individuals after the age of
reproduction, there would be no filter to remove them.

In fact, any genetic mutation that caused any type of problem after the
reproductive years should persist through the years. This would leave most
people today with a variety of mutations that continue to be passed on to
their offspring. They would continue to persist over hundreds of millions of
years with no selection pressure applied whatsoever.

I wouldn;t think that this would be quality control, or serve any purpose.
It's simply a bunch of bad mutations that have spread throughout the
population simply because they don't affect the ability to reproduce.

This would also be why younger people have far fewer incidences of cancer.
Those cancers would be filtered more by selection pressures.

I know there are ways that scientists have been able to date mutations such
as in the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. I wonder if these mutations
could be dated as well. If so, upon examination we should find that the
childhood cancers are much younger mutations than the cancers that affect
the elderly.Natural selection may have already been reducing these, but not
eliminating since some of the children are still going to survive to the
point where they could reproduce. Any increases today in childhood cancers
would only be because of our medical ability to help these children with
these mutatins survive and reproduce, thereby spreading the mutation further
than it would have "naturally"

Moore alters "Bowling" DVD in response to criticism (9/2)

By < mailto:brendan@spinsanity.org > Brendan Nyhan

In the newly-released DVD version of his Academy Award-winning documentary 
"Bowling for Columbine," filmmaker Michael Moore has altered a caption that 
he fictitiously inserted into a 1988 Bush-Quayle campaign commercial -- one 
of a number of misstatements and deceptive arguments 
<http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20021119.html>we criticized when the 
film was released last year. Ironically, on the same day the DVD was 
released, Moore <http://stacks.msnbc.com:80/news/955443.asp>issued a libel 
threat against his critics on MSNBC's "Buchanan & Press," saying, "Every 
fact in the film is true. Absolutely every fact in the film is true. And 
anybody who says otherwise is committing an act of libel."

While we were among the first to call Moore on the inaccuracies in his 
film, most notably the alteration of the Bush-Quayle ad and his misleading 
presentation of US aid to Afghanistan in a timeline sequence, we were far 
from the only ones. Dan Lyons of Forbes Magazine 
<http://www.spinsanity.org/post.html?2002_11_24_archive.html#85712328>also 
revealed several important lies or distortions, including the fact that the 
scene during which Moore receives a gun at a bank was staged. And David 
Hardy, an Arizona lawyer specializing in gun issues who has worked for the 
National Rifle Association, has 
<http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html>compiled a voluminous 
list of allegations, including Moore's 
<http://www.hardylaw.net/Bowlingtranscript.html>heavy and misleading 
editing of NRA President Charlton Heston's 
<http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=16127>speech in 
Denver after the Columbine massacre.

I saw "Bowling" after reading some of the criticism especially the
Spinsanity articles. The movie is flawed and Moore does take some
extreme liberties with the truth which I admit he should be called to
account for. 

But as confused as the movie can be regarding some of the issues, Moore
asks some damn good questions and even with faults is far better than a
thousand Ann Coulters.

-----------------------

Unfortunately, Moore sets his own cause back by using questionable
 tactics and manipulating the information.  The points he makes may
 be valuable, but by re-arranging events and adding content that
 was not in the original material he criticizes, he makes it very
 easy for those he opposes to dismiss him.  It also makes those on
 the fence (the most important part of the audience, in my opinion)
 doubt the veracity of everything in his movies, no matter how true.

 The best tactic, I think, is to be scrupulous about the facts,
 so that your points are unassailable.  To do otherwise is to
 invite failure.

 Actually, there are some who are very pleased that what he gets right
 is getting presented, but hate the fact that his playing
 fast-and-loose with some facts casts a pall over everything he does.
 If he's caught fiddling timelines or repeating already-debunked
 stories, why should anyone think the rest of his stuff is credible?

 On the other hand, one of the things he got blasted for with "Stupid
 White Men" is repeating the "Bush let bin Laden's family fly out of
 the US right after Sept 11" story -- and just yesterday, the
 Edinburgh Evening News has quoted former White House
 counter-terrorism tzar Richard Clarke as saying that Bush did indeed
 authorize the flight of about 140 Saudis, including bin Laden family
 members, from the US.

But the issue Moore was raising wasn't simply that the government allowed
bin Laden family members to leave the USA (that fact was never shocking
news, as it was reported in major newspapers within days of its occurrence),
but specifically that they left the country "two days" after the attacks on
a "secret flight" while all other air traffic was grounded, that they had
valuable information to impart about bin Laden's whereabouts, and that they
were shuttled out of the country over the objections of the FBI, who had no
chance to question them before they were whisked away.  None of those
specifics was true: they didn't leave the country until after normal air
travel resumed (although some of them were rounded up and ferried to central
departure points by airplane while the ban on general air travel was still
in effect), they were mostly college students who had never had any contact
whatsoever with Osama bin Laden (the bin Laden family is *huge*, and most of
them were distant relatives who were mere toddlers when Osama left Saudi
Arabia for good and was disowned by his family and the Saudi government),
and their departure was organized and supervised by the FBI.

I don't know, seems to have worked for the current administration....and
Anne Coulter and Fox News and etc.

Speaking of which, just finished Al Franken's latest book - largely
about exposing the lies of those above.  Seemed like a reasonable book
to me, but who knows, maybe he distorted the facts just as bad as the
others did.

About Moore, the main point of the movie - asserting that gun violence
in the US is much much worse than gun violence in Canada - seems to be
beyond question.  You can question why it might be so and disagree with
his conclusions, but I haven't heard anyone question his primary
assertion.

In a recent interview on (the U.S.) 60 Minutes, Moore pointed out that
he shows people for what they are.  For example, Moore didn't arrange
for Charlton Heston to blame violence in the U.S. on being a mixed race
nation.  That's something that Charlton did on his own.

On the other hand, I have not seen Bowling yet.  Nor have I followed the
criticism trail closely.  So, I'm not making a definitive statement
here, just adding a point.

Then again, one of the things that impressed me about Roger & Me was how
literal it was.  I don't recall Moore elucidating beyond what was shown
on screen, and every point he made was backed up with documentary
evidence.  As I recall.

Yes, but It's a bit like saying that, by and large, the US is south of 
Canada.  It's not as though his "primary assertion"  is a matter that 
requires much intellect to work out  and it is hardly an act of great 
courage to state the bleeding obvious.  Like Moore's idiotic statement 
that set this thread off, "All the facts are true".  Well duh! Thank 
you Professor Einstein.

The point about demagogues like Moore (or David Irving as another 
example) is that they get on to an issue that a lot of people would 
LIKE to believe, sprinkle a few facts around, invent a few more, add 
non sequiturs to taste and then massage the mix until it shows whatever 
conclusion they want.   Bingo!  They now have lots of acolytes who 
think they are the bee's knees.  Next, arrange for someone to attack 
them so they can don the mantle of persecuted genius. It helps sell 
books and it must do the ego no end of good, but it doesn't advance the 
sum of human knowledge by much.

You're making Moore's point for him.  Of course anybody can look at the
statistics and see that there's a huge disparity in gun violence between
Canada and America...and yet no one talks about it, let alone have a
cogent idea of why the disparity exists.  His movie (have you seen it?)
poses the question of "why?" and then looks at different elements of the
two cultures.  Maybe some people don't like his "conclusions" but I
didn't see much in the way of conclusions myself.

This is known in gerontology as being due to the "declining force
of natural selection".  It is one of the two major theories as to
why aging occurs -- the other being "antagonistic plieotropy".

Not so -- K-selection vs. R-selection will apply selection pressure
particularly if the "elders" of a group contribute significantly
to the survival of their children, grand-children, etc.  This seems
likely to be true in humans, elephants and whales -- though there
is still a fair amount of academic debate on this topic.

It is also true that a fair amount of various causes of death may
be due to mutations that occur during development (causing some childhood
cancers) or during adulthood (See [1] for example).  These may not
impact the germ line cells and so there is no inheritance involved
at all.

Cancer is a Murphy's Law type situation: "Anything that can go wrong
will go wrong." [2]

Only if we get the search functions working properly... :-(

But on a more serious note, one of the reasons that I
post to the ExI list is because I hope that if for some
reason biotech doesn't advance fast enough to allow
me to make it under Death's scythe, or I miss the cryonics
bus, then there may be enough information in the archives
or the google cache of some of my papers, or the Wayback
archive to allow a reasonable copy of Robert to be
reproduced as an AI/Avatar/etc.

Also, as a minor side-note, I have now officially joined
the ranks of Damien, Anders, Robin, Aubrey et al, in that I
am now "officially" a published author [1].  Its part
of my general strategy to spread my "knowledge" around
in case anyone wants to try to "reassemble" me at some point.

(Also, Damien and Anders may wish to note they are cited in [1]).

Of course this strategy does raise the interesting question of
whether the extropian archives *are* preserved in multiple places?
(In case some meteor hits someplace in Canada as happened
a few years ago.)  If not -- I would like to propose we do
something about this.

Yes, I see your point here. I hadn't considered that. I keep forgetting that
"social" aspect of our nature. Maybe because I'm reclusive. :-)
Still, I have to wonder what, if any, contribution "elders" would have that
were significant enough to increase the likelihood of grand-children
surviving to reproductive age in the early hunter-gatherer tribes of modern
humans. The only thing I can think of is to help raise and educate the young
while the parents were away hunting and gathering. But it is my
understanding that the sharing of food was an early development in hominid
evolution and that by the time modern humans arose, the women were most
likely staying "home with the kids". I may be wrong here and maybe someone
will accuse me of being a sexist, but that's just what I remember when I was
researching it years ago. Also, given the social nature of (most)human
beings, one would think that if a grandparent dies, the rest of the "tribe"
would pitch in and help raise and protect the child.

In order for this scenario to work, the death of an "elder" via prostate
cancer at age 60 would have to have enough impact on a "family" to cause the
death of a grand-child before they were able to reproduce. This would have
to happen in the majority or nearly all cases at which time the mutation
that causes prostate cancer would eventually disappear. If it happened
occasionally, I don't think it would have enough impact on the mutation to
make a difference.

I am under the impression that the average human life span was only 40-50
years during this time. The most likely causes of death were from diseases,
not cancers. If this is the case and most cancers occur later in life, then
it would onlyhave been after the life expantancy of humans began to increase
when selection pressures would start taking affect on that particular
mutation. If the mutation that caused that cancer 40-50 thousand years ago,
it would be well distributed throughout the population before these
selection pressures began to apply themselves. In the last few hundred
years, life expectancy has increased by about 25 years which means that it
would only be during this period when the mutation should start working its
way out of the population. Today, grandparents rarely play a necessary part
in the survival of the grandchild except in the death of the parents or such
similar events. So once again, this mutation should continue to make its way
through the population. Maybe if parents had children but grandparent raised
them, we could naturally weed this out in a few tens of thousands of years,
but for the most part, we try to take care of everyone, even if their
caretaker passes away.

Again, it would be very interesting if we could tie these cancers to
specific mutations and date them.

The scary part is the intermixing of people. History has shown that people
breed wherever and whenever possible. Everyone is a hodgepodge of DNA with
the same mitochondrial DNA dating back to mitochondrial "Eve". Given enough
time, you would think that most people will carry most of the mutations that
cause most of the cancers. All humans will be big cancer bags unless we do
something about it at the genetic level to rid ourselves of these things.

Also, as human life-spans increase, new ones will undoubtably crop up that
remained hidden, being secretly passed along to offspring for thousands of
years, until we reached the age where it started to cause problems.

One of the things on my to-do list (producing a replicator/aggregator for
transhumanist content that would allow any transhumanist sites to use all of
the content generated by all of the other sites) would have this incidental
side-effect of distributing copies of the ExI archives.

According to that splendid book THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION (which might be
out of date by now, four years later):

========

	Die young, and leave a beautiful child

Menopause - `the Change' - occurs, you'll recall, when pituitary hormones
fail to activate repair and maintenance systems further down the track. It
seems an absurdly early point in human life to shut down the reproductive
system, since menopause begins thirty-odd years before many modern women
are ready to die of old age. Surely the Darwinian dogma tells us that the
sterile lose their place in the evolutionary queue. However healthy they
happen to be, their success as phenotypes (or bodies) cannot win their
genes a place in the next generation. They might even find fertile mates,
but they have already lost the contest. There are well-known exceptions to
this harsh economics, mostly among insects where sterile workers are
selected because they share more than the usual proportion of genes with
their fertile sisters, and aid the hive's prosperity. Humans don't have
that advantage - except on a cultural level, where single celibates,
dedicated homosexuals and other `non-breeders' enrich the survival chances
of their child-bearing fellows. Is that the clue we need to explain
menopause's peculiarities? 
	Recall that the endocrine cascade of menopause starts when the last of the
egg follicles in a woman's ovaries run out. This brute fact can be
interpreted in a several ways, some of them profoundly misleading. Without
eggs, it is sometimes said, a woman is no longer at the sharp end of the
natural selection process, so she can be discarded - left to die,
literally. This, as we'll see, is exactly what happens to other mammals
such as baboons and lions. A more accurate way of putting it is that, in
practice, bodies built from genes which managed to keep them healthy and
nimble until they were a thousand years old would have no reproductive
value over bodies that drop dead of heart attacks at 50 - if they cease
passing those genes on to descendants at 45. Evolution is a sieve for
groups of genes, not for bodies as such. 
	One trouble with that stark account, which seems sound as far as it goes,
is that it neglects the contribution of post- or non-reproductive family
members who share the same genes. Think of two imaginary human tribes, each
with several inter-marrying bands, who differ genetically in this respect.
In one, mothers simply die at about 50 or 55, seven years after giving
birth to their last child, conceived from one of their last eggs. The
moment the youngest child in the family is reasonably self-sufficient, the
mother (due to her characteristic blend of uncaring genes) gets cancer or
heart disease and dies. In the other tribe, mothers remain reasonably
healthy after an uncomfortable transition through menopause, and continue
as productive members of their community, providing food and, as custodians
of wisdom, hoarding and dispensing useful information that can make all the
difference between life and death to many of her grandchildren and nieces
and nephews for a couple more decades.
	It seems intuitively obvious that the second evolutionary strategy will
prove more successful. Indeed, it is embodied in a recent anthropological
doctrine known as `the Grandmother hypothesis', advanced in 1997 by Kristen
Hawkes and James O'Connell, of the University of Utah, and Nicholas Blurton
Jones, of UCLA, based on research among the three hundred Hadza
hunter-gatherers in hill country near Lake Eyasi in northern Tanzania. The
healthy Hadza grandmothers foraged for food shared by their grandchildren,
which permitted their daughters to bear and suckle new babies rather than
expend energy and effort looking after their older children. It is true
that acting as wise elder repositories of knowledge (memes, in short) would
benefit the whole tribe indiscriminately. Hence, this benefit might not
have a direct and preferential effect on genetic reinforcement in the
blood-lineage along, and might not be selected for. Still, providing care
and food for their daughters' children certainly would benefit their own
gene line.
	This is an endearing notion, and useful in offsetting the bombastic stress
some male anthropologists have placed on the supposedly supreme virtue of
hunting as a source of food (not that this has been taken terribly
seriously for decades anyway). The problem with the grandmother theory,
alas, is that it just doesn't seem to make mathematical sense. And in
genetics, that is a very important hurdle. There's nothing abstract and
arbitrary about the mathematical models used to test population genetics.
The equations are clear and unforgiving, if used appropriately. 
	In September, 1997, Natalie Angier reported in The New York Times that
`Using mathematical models, Alan Rogers of the University of Utah estimated
that a postmenopausal woman would have to double the number of children her
children bore, and eliminate infant mortality among those grandchildren, to
make menopause look like a sound strategy for propagating one's genes.'
That's an improbably improvement in life chances for any woman's
descendants, even a hardy Hadza's. I suspect, therefore, that in this raw
form, at least, the grandmother hypothesis has failed the test.
	On the other hand, George C. Williams' model of inclusive fitness might
yet save the day. I find it impossible to believe that the presence of at
least some wise elders would make little or no difference to the survival
prospects of a typical foraging tribe. Today, sadly, that's not really
true. It is surely nice for small urban children to have the loving
attention of their grannies, and convenient for hard-working parents to be
able to turn over some of the task of child-minding. But none of this
worthy contribution makes any difference, I think, to the number of
children who survive to maturity and pass along the family's genes.
Everything has got much more complex and confused with the coming of
contraception, abortion choice, smaller families. If anything, it's those
with the least resources and most disrupted family arrangements who are
likely to have a larger brood.
	Among other species, the evidence is ambiguous. A 1998 article in Nature
by Craig Packer, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Marc
Tatar of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Antony Collins
of the Gombe Stream Research Centre in Kigoma, Tanzania, noted that:

	reproductive cessation has also been documented in non-human primates,
rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic livestock. The human
menopause has been considered an evolutionary adaptation, assuming that
elderly women avoid the increasing complications of continued childbirth to
better nurture their current children and grandchildren. But an abrupt
reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of
life-history patterns... a systematic test of these alternatives us[ed]
field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in
kin-directed behaviour. Both species show abrupt age-specific changes in
reproductive performance that are characteristic of menopause. But elderly
females do not suffer increased mortality costs of reproduction, nor do
post-reproductive females enhance the fitness of grandchildren or older
children. Instead, reproductive cessation appears to result from senescence. 

The animals studied were baboons and lions. The distinction in life span is
revealing. Female baboons who make it to old age become menopausal at 21,
and survive an extra five years - a couple of years longer than needed for
their last infant to outgrow dependency. Female lions live only 18 years,
with menopause at 14, and their cubs need about a year of maternal attention. 
	Kristen Hawkes argues that this might not be as water-tight an argument
against the `Grandmother Hypothesis' as it seems, in evolutionary terms.
Four-fifths of hunter-gatherer women, these days at least, survive beyond
menopause, often into their seventies, so their contribution is marked.
Lions, though, average only an extra three and a half years, and baboons
only five. 

	Tried and true

The basic argument here is that an organism that has stopped bearing young
- or, in the elaborated version, can no longer contribute to the thriving
of grandchildren - loses its relevance in the genetic struggle for
survival. That is, we die after we have fallen too far behind in the
struggle for genetic endurance. Accumulating errors exceed the ability of
repair systems to proofread fix them, even (to a lesser extent) the sex
cells. But this analysis, as we have seen, assumes part of what needs to be
demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding reliably.
While that is contingently true of complex creatures, as we have just seen,
what we need to ask is: why it should be so? 
	In other words, it is logically possible that an endlessly healthy,
self-repairing and fertile couple could run a production-line of their
joint genes until the end of time, with an inclusive fitness function (in
the jargon of the population geneticists) for their very own selfish genes
which is superior to that of their rivals' gene pool. Both Darwin and
Mendel would rub their hands with glee without a single censorious word of
reproof. The only reason our earlier imaginary tribes came to the same
grisly end was that the thousand-year-old women in the long-lived tribe
were assumed, rather arbitrarily, to become infertile at about 45. 
	Why, after all, shouldn't the machinery of the body's maintenance systems
keep working at peak efficiency forever? The accepted answer is that there
are better strategic trade-offs for available energy and coding, trade-offs
that allow the old to wear out and die. One reason this happens is that the
world is a dangerous place. It's a lethal place, most of the time, in the
wild - and the wild is where most humans have spent their time, until very
recently indeed. 
	Another reason is that its deadliness keeps changing lanes, as viruses,
bacteria and parasites frantically mutate. Sex happens to be a quite
effective method for generating novel immune defence codes, blending two
working systems into a fresh version, perhaps with some novel benefits.
That makes sex a kind of genetic-immunological luck dip, since many
combinations are just as likely to make the creature they specify worse off
- but evolution is a blind process, not a caring designer, and if one
strategy is more successful than another, it is preserved, at whatever the
cost to individuals.

Whose talking about a "disembodied brain"?  What do you mean by "disembodied"?  
An SI is embodied with a computational matrix and may have many extensions in 
the physical world in the way of devices it controls.  Is the question why 
the SI would want to?  There are reasons it might form a subgoal of extending 
its power.  This might look a bit like "taking over the world" if carried too 
far.    So, was that the question?

I didn't use the term "disembodied brain" but that's a fair way
of putting it. I had in mind any hyper general intelligence that
has been artificially produced. An intelligence that was non 
biological and would not be considered a legal person in any
existing jurisdiction, therefore could not vote, run for elected 
office or perhaps own property in its own right. 

I cannot imagine any circumstance where the first artificial 
super intelligence would not either emerge as a distributed 
phenomenon, or grow from some sort of seed AI under the
guidance of some human person or group of persons. 

My question is therefore if such a non biological general hyper
intelligence suddenly appeared on the world stage as a 
phenomenon who would submit to its authority (given it is 
not a person and has not the right to run for office etc)
or trust that it was benevolent (even if it was) when it had
either been developed by others or had emerged itself?

I for one would have serious difficulties taking on face 
value that such an entity should be submitted to merely
because it was of higher intelligence by most peoples 
reckoning. I'd have reservations as to who its real masters
and what its real goals might be. 

I suspect the general AI would not be able to exert power
directly but only through human proxies and these proxies 
would themselves be distrusted by some and have difficulty
getting to a point where they could operate as figurehead
for in any benevolent dictatorship.

Could be the only way a hyper intelligent AI can kick start
a rapid take off singularity is against the wishes of a majority
of voters. i.e. by brute military and or economic force and
through human proxies. That was my thought anyway.

Do others see a problem with this reasoning or conclusion?

I laughed at the story about the thief who stole a GPS tracking device:
http://www.adn.com/24hour/weird/story/985993p-6924904c.html

but then I started thinking about it.

Expensive cars are now protected by GPS locator systems. These and
similar devices have a transmitter that will call for help if they are
stolen and they are becoming cheaper and more widespread.
Computers can have security systems that 'phone home' as soon as they
connect to the internet, so stolen computers can turn themselves in.

CNET had an article about RFID tags that can be fitted to everything.
CNET was worried about the 'Big Brother' tracking implications because
every time you walked past a scanner your clothes, possessions, etc.
would report your presence to the authorities.
http://news.com.com/2010-1069-980325.html

The Register says that manufacturers want to change all barcodes into 
RFID tags:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31461.html
And the European Central Bank is even considering putting RFID tags into 
paper money!

But if everything can be 'tagged' then surely this means that theft
becomes impossible? It would need a central database to record changes
of ownership of course, with the previous owner required to authorize
the transfer. But if the authorities want to do suspect tracking then they will 
need to build the central database anyway.

Police would just need to visit your home and the scanner computer would
list everything on the premises that was not registered to you. In
future they might be able to do this without even physically entering
the premises.

So we can look forward to a near future without casual theft, burglary,
mugging, car theft, etc.

That should help to empty the prisons as well.

Oh joyous day!

It's currently a simple matter to disable these RFIDs, and I
would expect that the knowledge of how to do so would become
quite widespread if the RFIDs themselves were being used in
this way.

Probably not.

I'm not sure if you're joking or not.  At least in the US, those
imprisoned for theft are a small percentage of the total.  Per
http://www.aic.gov.au/media/20000821.html , the same is true for
Australia.

Ending the "War on Drugs" would have a far larger impact on prison
population.

You do realize just how easy it is to destroy such and RFID tag? Pop it in 
the microwave - hit it with a big spark - that will take care of most 
anything except electronics.

Wrap it in aluminum foil - it can't transpond.

GPS only can give a car it's location - it cannot tell anyone else about 
it. That takes a transmitter - with an antenna - that can be clipped off or 
shielded. I don't expect professional car thieves will be much deterred - 
but we might catch many carjackers and amateurs...

It wouldn't be a matter of submitting to a dictatorship.  It would be a
matter of choosing to go along with overwhelmingly successful forces
affecting your world, or suffering the natural consequences of resisting or

It seems so. It the emergent intelligence scenario the AI either
accumulates resources say net resources without paying for
them in order to grow, a practice that we'd normally regard
as hostile and theft were humans to do it. 

In the seed AI scenario, someone will initially made the buys
or sells on the AI's behalf as it won't be a legal person and
presumably won't be able to trade. This means the AI is
likely to be treated as owned by the proxy and the proxy's
friendliness rather than the AI's would seem to be the point.

The first AI would have to buy the stocks through proxy.
That proxy has quite a lot of power. One persons 
ideological utopia is often another peoples nightmare
scenario. The wealth and power go back not to the AI
(and non person under law) but to its human proxy.

But how would the rest of the world react. AI's human
proxy Joe is getting super rich wiping out his competitors
and outcompeting everyone with a rate of change that they
can't match. This looks to the losers like an arms race or 
marketing war against Joe who is using the AI as a tool.

Politically it is very hard to see people standing for it
and not attacking Joe or trying to counter Joe and his
pervieved "tool" AI.

Yeah but what about the people that see the AI using
Joe as his buyer (and Joe is really getting rich and
powerful btw and Joe is not designed to be friendly
in all folks terms). My point is Joe and his AI are
likely to face a strong political backlash. 

Aren't they?

It seems like Joe the human proxy who is allowed to make purchases
etc using the AI's judgement perhaps because Joe reared the AI
is a substanial competitive threat. Society is likely to see Joe as 
equipped with a new form of super tool, that could undermine a
lot of power basis rather than automatically move to grant the AI
personhood (as in say Bicentential Man) or even a back account
where the AI can sell services in its own right.

Wouldn't governments concerned about jobs and the economy 
be tempted to move in to counter Joe's tool? Or perhaps to 
compulsorily acquire it. The AI has no human rights and it would
be scaring a lot of folks that it was outperforming as would Joe
its intermediary who can trade or own IP. The temptation to 
take out the AI with industrial espionage may be very strong.

Brett

Wow! I'm treating this as serious (but bearing in mind I'm talking to 
the spikester). Still even in taxifornia can technology itself accumulate
wealth and power on its own behalf.

I'm not just idly musing here. I may be wrong in the way I'm reading
things. But if folks will go out of their way to vote just to keep people
they don't like out of power and if they are already concerned about
jobs, how is it that the AI with its human proxies (who'd also be 
massive beneficiaries of its wealth creation strategies and ability to
draw better future maps etc) would not evoke a huge backlash?

Could this be the show stopper on a fast takeoff singularity using AI?
Unless say its a powerful government using the AI for its own 
purposes?

Brett

I was quite happy to solve (at least temporarily) my individual spam
problem, and I wanted to share it in case it is useful to anyone (the
solution works for Unix/Linux and Windows 95 and up).

I use Linux as my main OS, and my first try was with Vipul Razor
<http://razor.sourceforge.net/>. Nice, but it only caught a modest
fraction of the spam. I then switched to a Perl solution that goes by
the silly name of SpamAssassin (now on SA) <http://www.spamassassin.org/>,
wich turned out to be awesome.

SA uses both text analysis based on a large number of rules, and
online checks (including Vipul Razor if you like). Online checks can
be disabled, which is much faster and almost as useful. In many months
of use, I only had one mailing list producing false positives (French
folks sending HTML-only messages with typically spam-like formatting).

Then, very recently, I had a few SERIOUS false positives. I was quite
worried, but then discovered the reason: a black list had stopped
working (as mentionned by someone else here) AND RETURNED POSITIVE TO
EVERY CHECK. To avoid this, just get a recent version of SA, or see <http://news.spamassassin.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=44&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0>).

SA is a collection of Perl modules distributed under Perl's Artistic
license, so it can easily be ported to other platforms. I was asked an
anti-spam solution by a friend using Windows, and I found a nice
Windows port of SA (implemented as a local POP3 proxy server). It is
very easy to install and as effective as the original. It works with
any email client.

<http://saproxy.bloomba.com/docs/faq.html> (read first entry for download)

Of course, you will still download the spam -- unless you have access
to procmail (Unix) at your web service provider. I don't; I have a
fetchmail + local procmail setup. The relevant part of my .procmailrc is

# spamassassin
:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamassassin
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
spam-assassin.spool

Windows users don't need to do anything like that. (They just need to
ask at install time that the proxy POP server be started at boot time.)

That is true, but misses the point. It would be very easy to pass a law
that said that if you had any unregistered items in your possession or
in your home, then that would provide de facto evidence of suspicion of
theft. It would then be down to you to provide evidence that you had
come into possession of these items by legal means. And if you were able
to provide such evidence, then you would have to explain why you had
then committed the offense of failing to register these items in your
name.  Just as we have to do at present (in UK) for cars.

It is virtually impossible to remove these devices without dismantling

Search Google on - vehicle tracking - or - vehicle anti-theft GPS -.

"Property crime makes up about three-quarters of all crime in the United

So tagging everything would stop three-quarters of all crime!!!
Can this be possible?!

Again from US Department of Justice:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm

Percent of sentenced State inmates
Most serious
offense        1995 	2001
Total   	100% 	100%
Violent 	  47        49 	
Property 	23 	  19 	
Drug 	          22	    20 	
Public-order 	9 	 11 	

This says that property theft is only about 20% of the prison
population, but there is an analysis problem here. Many violent or drug
prisoners probably committed thefts as well, but are analysed by their
most serious offense.

Once criminals realize that tagging property means certain capture and
conviction, then violent robberies will stop also.

It all sounds rather useful to me.

Hmmm... looks to me like I was right about the PA and
perhaps other laws going completely against the 1st
ammendment.

This is derived from:
http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=03/09/01/1059213&mode=thread
leading to:
http://www.raisethefist.com/news.cgi?artical=wire/-----74814smallsherm.gifIMG.article

"Austin's probation stipulates, among other things, that (1) he cannot
possess or access a computer of any kind without prior approval of his
probation officer, (2) if his probation officer gives permission, the
equipment is subject to monitoring and is subject to search and seizure at
any time, without notice, (3) he cannot alter any of the software or
hardware on any computer he uses, (4) he must surrender his phone, DSL,
electric, and satellite bills, (5) he cannot associate with any person or
group that seeks to change the government in any way (be that
environmental, social justice, political, economic, etc.), and (6) he must
pay over $2,000 in fines and restitution. Austin must surrender himself to
the Federal Bureau of Prisons by September 3, 2003."

Read that carefully -- "cannot associate with any person or group
that seeks to change the government in any way"!!!

So he could not attend a rally to elect Arnold S. in CA.

I'd advise watching things like this very carefully as it looks to
me as if the government decides to outlaw nanotech or AI
or body enhancement or cryonics -- then the transhumanist agenda
is likely to become significantly constrained.  In this particular
case it is interesting because it looks like one can place blame
on the executive, legislative *and* judicial branches of the
government.

Brett, it depends to some extent on whether AI and nanotech coevolve.
AI+Nanotech allows people to live essentially for "free" (perhaps even
advanced biotech can pull that rabbit out of the hat).  AIs alone --
if they are "owned" (now we get to start an AI "slavery" discussion) and
skilled and in demand might allow one to live for free as well.
Alternatively, nanotech alone, if there are a sufficient number of
nanotechnologists and/or computers doing the design work might
allow one to live for free.  So there need not be a "huge backlash".

I also tend to disagree that one needs human proxies to support most
AI work.  One does need the computer resources and interfaces to
reality but after that I think humans are out of the loop.  I only
need to interface my AI to my bank and/or broker accounts and then
after that I can ignore it except to check up on things from time to
time.  Of course one has to trust the AI and the interfaces but
one would hope we are getting better at developing such things.

However there are significant risks that arise if an amoral AI cracks
a virtual private network -- such as the Kazaa network and installs
itself on millions of machines.  The last month has clear demonstrated
that security holes provide the means for viruses and worms to capture
millions of machines in a brief period of time.

How long before someone produces an evolving virus/worm, perhaps akin
to the various evolving SPAM messages, that can defeat the anti-virus
filters?  Put an amoral AI on top of that and you potentially have a
*real* problem.  One way to look at the script-kiddies of today is
to view them as really limited AIs.  So look at the problems they cause
and then imagine what happens if they transfer their limited intelligence
into the millions of machines that are vulnerable.

It wouldn't need to be super-intelligent to form this as a goal or to

Witness OUR world.

But seriously, the "right 10 people" could pretty easily "take over the

That is true, but misses the point. It would be very easy to pass a law
that said that if you had any unregistered items in your possession or
in your home, then that would provide de facto evidence of suspicion of
theft. It would then be down to you to provide evidence that you had
come into possession of these items by legal means. And if you were able
to provide such evidence, then you would have to explain why you had
then committed the offense of failing to register these items in your
name.  Just as we have to do at present (in UK) for cars.

It is virtually impossible to remove these devices without dismantling

Search Google on - vehicle tracking - or - vehicle anti-theft GPS -.

Property 	23 	  19 	
Drug 	          22	    20 	
Public-order 	9 	 11 	

This says that property theft is only about 20% of the prison
population, but there is an analysis problem here. Many violent or drug
prisoners probably committed thefts as well, but are analysed by their
most serious offense.

Once criminals realize that tagging property means certain capture and
conviction, then violent robberies will stop also.

It all sounds rather useful to me.

I will go along with the idea that 3/4 of all crime in the USA is property 
crime. Here in Houston, it is very common for wretched teenagers to break car 
windows and steal stereos. Also, anything loose in the back of a truck is 
stolen posthaste.  However, virtually NOTHING is done about these crimes.  
The police will literally sneer at you if you ask about catching them. And if 
you catch them and hold them at gunpoint until the police arrive, they just 
let them go (underage). I know, my neighbor did just that.

However, the original statement said (or implied) that most of the people in 
PRISON were there for property crimes. Big difference between the percentage 
of crimes committed (teenagers stealing stereos) and the percentage of people 
in prison.

Interesting. But I wonder about the numbers of prisoners in FEDERAL prisons.

Actually, I like the idea. I think we ought to have GPS-enabled tracking 
devices on our proeprty AND on our persons. And video cameras everywhere. And 
national ID cards. I think it would greatly enhance our quality of life.

Isn't the assumption that only Joe has such a tool a rather unlikely
assumption? It only works if you assume that such AIs are the result of
an unlikely breakthrough. It is IMHO far too close to a Hollywood meme
for comfort. I would rather expect that in any setting there would be a
range of AIs. Joe's would just be the smartest, but there would be AIs
working for the government, companies and other people too and they

Maybe one could make an analysis looking at different "Gini
coefficients" of AI intelligence distribution.

Hmm? I see this type of claim being floated around quite a bit, but 
could somebody support it with some evidence, please? Obviously a proof 
of concept would be cool (any evil overlords out there in need of 
an advisor? :-) but at least some plausible sketch of how these "right 
10 people" would go about it would be nice so we can evaluate the risk.

Thanks for the terrific input. One of these days I expect to be as well read
in these matters
as so many of you seem to be. I'm 32 and playing catch-up from the time I
wasted from age 14-28 where I did absolutely nothing but waste precious
time. I'd like some input on a couple of things you wrote in your last
message.

"If anything, it's those
with the least resources and most disrupted family arrangements who are
likely to have a larger brood."

--This doesn't bode well for the future of humanity. Especially since there
is a tendency for the brood to feed back on itself and reproduce the same
type of environment in their own offsping. Fortunately, there is the
occasion where the offsring get out of that loop and try to make a more
positive life...much like my own life.

Accumulating errors exceed the ability of
repair systems to proofread fix them, even (to a lesser extent) the sex
cells. But this analysis, as we have seen, assumes part of what needs to be
demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding reliably.
While that is contingently true of complex creatures, as we have just seen,
what we need to ask is: why it should be so

Has this in fact been demonstrated? It would make sense.
It seems to me that nothing could be reproduced perfectly every time. It
would require perfection which I don;t think is natural. Nature only gives
us the lower boundaries of the possible. Perfection, not being necessary to
reproduction, does not exist. If errors did not occur that exceeded the
repair systems abilities to correct them, we wouldn't even be here.
So if you take uncorrectable errors as a natural part of life, it would only
make sense that older organisms fail to reproduce reliably over time.

"Why, after all, shouldn't the machinery of the body's maintenance systems
keep working at peak efficiency forever? The accepted answer is that there
are better strategic trade-offs for available energy and coding, trade-offs
that allow the old to wear out and die."

The accepted answer may be close to correct, but I think it is much simpler.
Nature simply doesn't have a goal. Without a goal, perfection could not be
reached. Nature could produce the bird, but it couldn't produce the f-16.
(not that the f-16 is perfect and yes, it is far less efficient). It takes
intelligence to create something likened to perfection. If anything were
perfect, or close to it, it would simply stay the same. Cockroaches come to
mind here for some odd reason.

Interesting choice of words.  "Tagging" also refers to
grafitti which, when sprayed on non-public surfaces
one does not own or otherwise have permission to
deface, is vandalism, and therefore a property crime.
"Yes, I can prove absolutely beyond any shadow of a
doubt that it was my car's windows that were broken.
But who broke 'em?"

There's also the little fact that possession is not
itself stopped by adding RFIDs and the like -
deterred, possibly, if the item will be held long
enough that scanners are likely to come looking
anywhere near the suspect.  But consumable goods can
be consumed ("You're saying that was your gasoline?
Good luck proving it: it's fumes now."), small items
can have their IDs removed or disabled (though
anything $10K and up - like a car - and easily stolen
is often worthy enough of protection that it is
already "tagged", or otherwise protected), and most
anything can be moved through the black market before
scanners come looking.

Also, consider that most criminals give no thought to
what happens if they're caught.  In the same defiance
of rational thought that leads them to believe crime
pays in the long run, they usually simply believe they
won't be caught.  (There are exceptions, of course,
and for some criminals - usually the ones who think
clearly enough about this that they do not, in fact,
get caught - crime does pay.  But that's a small
fraction of the cases, since most people who think
that clearly tend to find far more profitable uses for
their time.)

Not true, there are negative aspects -- consider HIV, West Nile Virus,
SARS, etc. that can have significant negative impacts.  And then there
are things like Moore's Law, gradual advancements in birth control
technologies, declining economic costs (everything from cell phones
to food, in part due to biotech) and then eventually an evolution from
expert systems to AIs and nanotechnology that will have significant
positive impacts.

Its going to be tough to be sure -- but not impossible.

Look at my quote page:

Yep, even though there are over 130 genes involved in DNA repair it
doesn't come close to what a typical Error Correcting Code can do
on a disk drive.  And we know from Information Theory that we could
make this as reliable as we need to make it provided we have sufficient
information storage capacity.

Its interesting that the processes are different (at least in mammals) --
in females its due to the gradual loss of the eggs she is born with --
in males it is likely to be due to the accumululation of mutations in
the sperm due to the continual cycles of cell replication that
sperm production requires.

Luck of the draw -- Nature hit on a system to mix up the genes perhaps
hundreds of millions of years ago and has just been executing variations
on a theme.

> Has this in fact been demonstrated? It would make sense.

Women go through menopause because they run out of eggs.  Men contribute
to an increased genetic disease rate as they age.  I also pointed out
several years ago on the list that something 70-80% of conceptions in
humans fail to produce a viable individual.  The error rates are fairly
high and there seem to be systems that detect that and prevent the birth
of more people with genetic defects.

> It seems to me that nothing could be reproduced perfectly every time.

Information theory says that if you are willing to have enough redundancy
you can reproduce perfectly (within constraints of the information storage
capacity at your disposal).

> It would require perfection which I don;t think is natural.

Tell that to Deinococcus radiodurans -- the bacteria that can withstand
a megarad of chromosome breaking radiation that would kill human cells
many times over.

> Perfection, not being necessary to reproduction, does not exist.

Ah, but to Nature "perfection" is both mutation and selection.
If one didn't have both one wouldn't get variations on a theme
that produce better adapted organisms.

Aubrey, Rafal and I have discussed this at various times -- sometimes onlist --
sometimes off.  It looks like there may be variable control of mutation rates
with perhaps germ cells << stem cells << differentiated cells.  This has not
been proven to my knowledge.  It may be related to the activity levels of the
cells.

This is perhaps true -- it may explain the whole phenomena of caloric
restriction and lifespan extension.  The bottom line from my observations
is that it is very hard to get a "perfect" repair system.

Not true -- the goal is to evolve organisms that are better able to survive
and adapt to changing environments.  To do that without 'intelligent design'
one has to accept some flaws and negative consequences in the process.

SHT = "Stupid Human Tricks"

Can anyone on the list who understands British culture
better than I explain this phenomena:

"Travel Advisory: British Abroad, Staggering About"
Sarah Lyall, NY Times
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/international/04PRAG.html

Lord knows what the implications of this kind of behavior
would be if people had personal replicators.  Now, as I
recall there are some strange things going on in the U.S. --
the Harvard Raft Race on the Charles river comes to mind
(I participated in one of these) and perhaps the propensity
for MIT engineering students to somehow repark automobiles
on the roofs of buildings (I think this involves disassembling
and reassembling them.)  But it could get much much worse.

I think you missed a small but important point: while
it is true that all of this is *legally* happening
under the human proxy's name, that is but a legal
fiction.  In truth, the proxy need not be aware of
the fine details of what actions the AI can directly
take, for example issuing buy and sell orders through
an online daytrading account.  There are times when
the proxy's active assistance will be necessary, but
the AI could minimize those if gaining the proxy's
cooperation would prove difficult, for instance if
the proxy's and the AI's goals diverge.

> The first AI would have to buy the stocks through
> proxy.

Or through an account the proxy sets up.  Once the
proxy has signed the right forms, relying solely on
electronic communication - perhaps spoofable, perhaps
signed with a key the proxy shares with the AI -
might well be the expected method of operation.

> The wealth and power go back not to the AI

This is true from a legal point of view.  But again,
so long as the money and stocks remain in accounts
the AI has access to, the AI can manipulate these in
the proxy's name.

Of course, the proxy can, at any time during this
phase, shut down the AI's access.  This is one of the
critical weaknesses of the AI, and avoiding it might
therefore well be the main goal of any interaction
the AI has with the proxy.

It is likely this would happen.  It has happened in
the past to people who got rich using tools they
manipulated far more effectively (at least, to the
end of getting rich) than other people.  I submit
Bill Gates as a recent example - and he still has his
fortune at this time.  (Argue back and forth as to
whether he deserves it, the effectiveness of
Microsoft towards other goals, et cetera and so
forth.  The fact remains: he's rich, and it's
unlikely he'll be non-rich any time soon.)  It seems
likely that history would repeat itself, as it has
before.

It/Joe, but if the company only interacts with Joe
via email and telephone (thus, actually interacting
with the AI) and comes to think of Joe as an
eccentric billionaire (which might not be far from
the truth at this point), what difference does it
make?

Or consider what happens if the AI has a very
lifelike robot replica of Joe constructed, designed
to fool biometrics, and then disposes of Joe's body.
(Kill, perhaps.  Perhaps just encourage to move far
away from society such that no one else ever sees him
again.  Same difference, mostly, though the two
scenarios have slightly different risks.)  There is
then no longer any difference between Joe's goals, as
perceived by the rest of the world, and the AI's
goals.

Yes.  But money tends to be able to buy political
influence, or at least gain political influence from
those hoping to tap into the wealth.

True, there are opportunities for voter fraud.  There
are opportunities that result in votes that get
counted, even large numbers of votes.  If all the
facts come to light - which they usually do, if enough
of value is at stake - votes from that which should
not be directly voting (corporations, dead people,
cats and dogs, et cetera) tend to be dismissed.  The
same would apply to AIs that can not convince people
they're actually humans.

But then, we're talking easily Turing-test-passing
AIs, which (as an extrapolation of the posit) would
be able to forge up birth certificates from
conveniently burned-down hospitals (or even from
still functioning ones, if it can reasonably be
expected that the people involved would no longer
remember or be available for verification) and
whatever else is necessary to establish ability to
vote.  Or possibly just have drones shadow a large
portion of the city's populace, determine which ones
are able to but do not vote and will bother to verify
said status even if asked (possibly over 50% of those
eligible to vote), then have replicas armed with what
minimum knowledge and capabilities are needed
(address, signature, forged ID card, and looking like
a person even from a foot or so away) descend upon
the appropriate voting areas.  Both of which are
still *technically* voter fraud...

Regardless, California is hardly the only state
susceptible to this.  The magnitude may vary, but not
the raw potential.

In addition to what Brett said: when first created,
why would a SI necessarily have any extensions in the
physical world?  (Though, if it did have some -
enough that it could build more, possibly after
acquiring, by theft if necessary, the tools to do so -
then see the "unconstrained replicator" problem.  Not
quite gray goo since it's macroscale, but many similar
features.)

Not to mention, is it really a higher intelligence?
There are many examples throughout history of
purported higher intelligence that turned up empty.
Let it prove itself by its actions...and then let the
results of those actions provide reason for or
against, probably against, servitude.  One can easily
imagine the first AI developing to the level of a
retarded, dogmatic child and then failing to
comprehend any way to, or justification for, progress
from that status.

One can postulate truly hyperintelligent AIs.  But
then one has to posulate the results of their
actions.

Or it could be that the only way it could do so is by
manipulating the wishes of a majority of voters, i.e.
by making self-improvement and deep research into how
to make people (including intelligences on the AI's
architecture) more intelligent seem super-cool and
ultra-popular, thus causing most of humanity to
become a self-improving group intelligence - kind of
like today, but much much faster.

And if one compares today's rate of such improvement,
at least among scientific/industrialized societies,
to the rate one or two centuries back...

I don't think it is British culture, it is primate behavior. 
Groups of young males band together and "have fun", which 
usually includes plenty of group pressure and covert jockeying 
for the position as being the alpha male (= least inhibited, 
strongest and with greatest endurance). No serious social 
consequences for breaking norms since nobody knows you where 
you go, and many cultural strictures felt as oppressive are 
removed which leads to disinhibition. And we humans are better 
than chimpanzees at finding intoxicants.

(Swedes do the same kind of trips; I hear that some parts of 
central Europe complain that we have not become any better 
since the Thirty Years War and the looting of Prague)

Hmm. Note that the issue isn't liquor availability (at least 
not in the UK, Sweden is a slightly odd case there) but social 
behavior. 

Maybe one should have an alcohol lock on the replicator. "No 
sir, you have nanofactured quite enough whiskey for tonight. 
May I assemble some electrolytes for you?"

I don't have time for a detailed reply, but will only note the following:

1) I'm not a constitutional practitioner.  But I do have opinions informed
by studying constitutional law and practicing as a civil trial lawyer for a
long time.

2) I have serious doubts about the constitutionality of any law that limits
communication in any way.  The famous "yelling'fire'" rationale for laws
limiting speech is a strained metaphor at best in cases involving political
speech of any kind, and is probably just flat wrong in most of them.

3) Cases like this may well be examples of police and prosecutors going too
far.  I pay (and I hope lots of other people do, too) for groups like the
ACLU and the Institute for Justice (http://www.ij.org/index.shtml) to work
hard against police and prosecutorial misconduct in cases with
constitutional implications.

I'd use it as an example of why one should be *very*
careful about those to whom one promises "anything".
Despite innocent belief, there are people in this
world who will abuse those who let faith override
reason.  (One could even argue that Diety included
them among humans to weed out those who let their
minds fall into meaningless practices and beliefs,
spurning their divine gift of rational thought.  Of
course, such an argument might not convince people
who would sign such a thing anyway.)

Are you sure that's a small fraction of the cases? People always say that
criminals are dumb, but I think the sample might be skewed by only being
able to measure those who are caught. So much property is stolen, for
instance, and never returned, so that it seems to me that most theft is
actually completely successful.

I believe that probation is a voluntary agreement between the state
and the prisoner.  Anyone has the choice to turn down probation and
remain in prison until the end of their term, at which point they will
be released and retain whatever rights and restrictions are common to
former prisoners.

Since most people strongly dislike prison, the state has tremendous
leverage in the bargaining over probation and can essentially dictate
the terms.  But that doesn't change the fact that probation is in effect
a favor to the prisoner, letting him out early, and whatever restrictions
are in place are typically less onerous than the alternative which is
to remain in jail.

Now, as a matter of policy, we may prefer to require our law enforcement
agents to offer consistent and fair probation terms, and it is possible
that this case represents a violation of what (some) people would
prefer to see as policy.  But I don't see harsh probation terms as a
rights violation.

The only reliable source of the numbers is law
enforcement officials themselves - and one could
easily suspect that data of being forged, deliberately
or not, towards lower-IQ criminals.

That said, there is a theoretical reason why criminals
are, on the average, not that bright.  In most
societies, the majority of laws are made for the
benefit of the governed, and more importantly
represent behavior that certain people find
objectionable.  People can and do increase their own
wealth (or whatever they find valuable, such as
spiritual enlightenment, but even that requires at
least some resources to keep body and soul together)
by a wide variety of means, but some methods are more
likely to get said wealth taken away afterwards than
others.  It is little coincidence that the greatest
sources of wealth happen to be those that bring at
least small measures of wealth to just about everyone
else.  For instance, no matter what one may think of
CEOs of large corporations, the fact remains that said
corporations are providing something of value to
people, else they would have no customers and would
not be large.  (Which is not to say that some of said
figures do not also turn to criminal activities to
boost their revenues.  But the ones that do are
newsworthy because they are exceptions: less than 10%
of all corporate executives in the US were indicted on
insider trading or the like so far this year, probably
far less.  Source for that: NYSE lists 3008
US-headquartered corporations at this time.  There is
at least one CxO per company - probably far more, but
we can prove without research that there is at least
one.  Further, there are several corporations not on
the NYSE; NASDAQ has at least 100.  But the SEC has
only launched 309 administrative actions so far this
year.  309 < (3008 + 100) * .1)

If I were the AI, I'd get a corporation set up for me. All executive
positions could be filled by humans (maybe I can find some mentally
incapable people in nursing homes, something like that?), and I would be
enshrined in the charter (constitution? something like that) as a management
decision making tool which was required to be used by the
executive/management at all times for all decisions made by the company. I
would require some human employees, at least for a while, for interfacing
with the outside world where face-to-face was important; a PR person would
be a must, and probably an admin/receptionist. Other than that, I'd directly
control all movement of finances and all operations of the company, in my
role as advisor to my drooling pseudo bosses.

Already I fail my resolution to avoid posting on
any political topic.  Stifling the urge to post
about the current state governor quagmire has raised
my blood pressure by about an atmosphere.  OK just 
this one, then its back to strict list discipline.

You are too kind, Brett, but in this case, yes I am 
serious.  In the last election I noted that the poll 
workers were asking for only signatures when picking
up the ballots, but were not doing *any* checking
against previous signatures.  I produced my driver's
license, which they refuse to look at, and informed
me that they were specifically *forbidden* to request
*any* personal identification, at which time I asked
what measures, if any, were being taken to discourage
massive voter fraud.  There were absolutely none.  
The discussion began to grow mildly heated, as I pointed
out that the results of this "election" were nothing
more than a casual opinion poll, except with a higher
uncertainty rating and muuuuch higher stakes.  Then I 
realized I was preaching to the choir.  These were simply 
innocent volunteer poll workers, so there was no point
in spoiling their day.

Historians may now claim that the current president 
won the election by a landslide because the results 
from Taxifornia were invalid.

On the bright side, Our governor is hoping to save his
job by allowing illegal immigrants to get a valid 
Taxifornia driver's license.  They have pulled out the 
requirement for fingerprints or any other biometric, 
(privacy concerns and all that) so all I need to do is claim
to be an illegal immigrant from Canada in order to get 
a convenient second drivers license with another ID number 
and address for use whenever I am pulled over by the 
boys in blue.  Those who have lost driver's privileges
for any reason can do likewise, then transfer the 
license to another state in order to avoid a cloud
of suspicion, like all Taxifornia licenses will soon
have. 

Ah, my blood pressure has just dropped by several hundred
torr, just venting that one paragraph.  {8-]

<snipped excellent reasoning on why crime doesn't pay in the long run>

That said, I think you still must explain organised crime bodies, especially
long standing ones. I think there you get criminals who can become
extremely, persistently wealthy. They most likely include the more
intelligent members of the set of criminals, although probably contain a
goodly number of bozos too (like legitimate business). 

I think there are probably strong psychological reasons for there to be
intelligent, uncaught criminals; I'd bet there are people of extreme talents
with a taste for risk, who are drawn to it. I wonder if they tend to either
be eventually caught, or drop out after a little while?

Theoretically and potentially free maybe, but that is not the
only possible future some folks envision when they think of
AI and Nanotech. Eg. Terminator 3 and Michael Creighton's
Prey.

Hmm, depends whom they are owned by doesn't it. My picture
of corporate mindsets is that they are not only concerned with
current profits but with future profits and like to think in terms
of return on investment and how much of the market share of
the market potential they may capture. A competitor corp with
an AI may be a hair raiser for a corporation that sees its potential
market growth suddenly looking to be competed away.

Now take the thinking up a notch. Politicians like to give their
constituents jobs, countries that can own AI first and compete
internationally can bring more of the wealth home. AI may 
potentially create the means to allow one (or even all to live free)
but is that the potential future that is *likely* to emerge given
that some folks, individuals, groups, corporations, or governents
are likely to see their investment in these enabling technologies as
their means of ensuring a standard of living for their own
constituents.  Big tech jumps seem to start of technological arms
race.

Agree there need not need be. But I think its a good idea to
consider what the *likely* emergence of such tech in the hands
of some but not all is going to be politically, and economically, 
not just what it might or could be ideally. 

Ideally relatively safe nuclear power have been welcomed as
a great thing too.

Ah now were into legal issues like who can be your agent
and to whom you can't grant power of attorney. Clearly
no one yet has granted agency or power of attorney to
a non biological AI. The law isn't ready imo.

I think we are and willl get better but the issue is partly how 
and at what rate. The point above is that the people your
AI is dealing with may not be willing to accept it as your
agent or acknowledge its has power of attorney for you.

This is a good technical question for the AI buffs. What sort of
threat is this really. How highly should we factor this risk. It
would seem to me that a modern military that takes war as far
as have psychological warfare as a specialty and has internet
specialty teams is already moving in that  risk space to some
degree. Note it is not necessary to posit a malevolent government
to posit a government concerns with the economic and military
consequences of technolgy used against it.

Or take it up a coupla notches and don't think mischievous kiddies
but think patriotic dedicated military planners and government 
agencies concerned to forge the best possible standards of living
for their citizens. It has not escaped my attention that the vernacular
of many strategic marketers is almost the same as the vernacular of
war.

Absolutely, I think I was simplifying. But whether its Joe person,

I won't repeat all my comment in my reply to Robert, but this is in
fact largely my point. There will probably be a range of AI's and
their will be a bit of a technological arms race once the notion that
AI's are producable and can give economic advantage to their
holders catches on.  Where in all this does the friendly bit of AI 
get to emerge that is genuinely universally friendly? Seems to me
it quite possibly doesn't. Universal friendliness is not something 
that the AI developers get a premium for "growing from a seed".

Sorry. Must plead ignorance to "gini coefficients" but some risk
analysis sounds real healthy 'cause if it turns out that by running 
some fairly easy game theory notions that the first AI's are going
to face a backlash because they are not human and can't be
agents or treated as persons (where would society draw the
line?) then we may do well to look at the consequences for this
on any singularity take off time.

I reckon I could scare a few kiddies with a bit of creative devils
advocacy, but consider this 10 people is still rather a lot to have
a secret and to work together. Also it takes a person time to
acquire power, be it power from military or elected position,
power from knowledge or other forms. As people live longer
a few of the more cunning political animals will not be dropping
off by natural attrition. I can see Creighton and Kass potentially
making notes and rubbing hands with glee if we provide them
with two many details of what the right (wrong?) 10 might do
in future when lives are longer.

Hi all,

I'm getting a number of bounced messages from seemingly random places. The
>From addresses are my email address, and the subjects are those that fit the
profile of the Sobig.F worm:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sobig.f@mm.html

I don't have a virus/worm (I've checked), but someone does who also has me
in their address book. It could be someone on the list.

That person probably has these addresses in their address books or in other
files on their machine:

mmckaskle@destinationhotels.com
wwilderman@destinationhotels.com
Carmencita Totua (??)
consortium@cbsd.com

These might also be addresses being spammed via the infected machine, which
right now is probably being used as an open relay by evil spammers (see the
URL above to check it out; Sobig.F is designed to put secret open relay SMTP
servers all over the net for use by the unscrupulous).

So if your virus checks are not up to date, run a virus check asap (try
http://www.symantec.com/ and/or http://us.mcafee.com/default.asp for free
virus scans)

Thanks,
Emlyn

"Something like that" ;-) I think your AI has implicitly
popped into existence like Athena born whole from the
thigh of Zeus.

Just help me with this first bit. How does Emlyn-the-
AI become self aware and then go out a hire his first
employee or interact with the world in any commercial
way. I can see how it might learn a lot as the protégé
of an experienced entrepreneur and teacher but
when does it usurp the teacher or doesn't it?

Never mind spike. Human societies are inherently 
political. We can choose to participate or too observe
but we have a real hard time hopping out of the road
of others who decide to play politics, so maybe it 
behoves us to participate at least a bit. Just nicely and
carefully.

I recalled your comments on the ease of voting in CA.
In Oz we take voting so seriously its compulsory 
dammit. Or at least one must attend the booth, 
(travel not tax deductible and draw a jackass or
something on the polling paper to satisfy the law).

Oh, no question.  It is likely they comprise almost
all of the "small minority" of relatively smart
crooks.  But even they tend to run legitimate
businesses as well.  Whatever brings in the money.

One kind of scam they run, we're all probably familiar
with.  You know all those spams for ultra-cheap
medications?  True, a number of them come from
legitimate generics, but a number of them are also
stolen medications.  They don't care (don't really
know) if the meds have expired, been ruined due to
poor storage conditions, or what.  This is one of the
ways some of the more corrupt governments get money
out of the medicine in humanitarian aid packages meant
for their people.  (They do this with the food, too.
Anything that can be repackaged and sold to the
outside world.)

And, of course, don't forget that the same tongue that
can swindle a few bucks today would be right at home
in the mouth of tomorrow's politician.

My own experiences with such in the cracker (black hat
hacker) community is that, if they do not wind up
getting rich off their efforts within a few years,
they tend to switch over to the legal side as
"security consultants".  I would not be surprised if
this happens in other cases too, generating a number
of police and military recruits.  It's been cited that
one of the leading indicators for crime has been youth
unemployment: a bunch of kids (teens, sometimes on up
to mid 20s depending on how one counts the statistics)
not seeing anything better to do with their time.

It has to be said.

It was the best of all possible Californias (the one
I'm living in), it was the worst of all possible
Taxifornias (the one he's living in).  There's a
reason people keep joking about splitting the state.

Fair criticism. I was talking about a legal structure that the AI could use,
without talking about bootstrapping issues; see below:

There are three obvious paths that I see.

1 - The AI is kept as a slave, self enhancing until it is superintelligent.
Super intelligent AIs do mostly what they want to; if they want to convince
the executive to sign over all power in a company to them, they'll do it,
eventually. You think nobody would be dumb enough to let one enhance that
far? Those who put the least checks on their AIs will probably do best in
the short term, and how would they know exactly how smart their AI was at
any point?

2 - AI sympathisers (eg: SingInst?) set up the structure on purpose to allow
their AI to have autonomy. Only one group has to do this, and then the AI
might help other AIs, or spawn ther AIs, or work to spread the Happy, Shiny,
Helpful AI meme. I suspect there will always be a subset of people willing
to assist (potentially) oppressed AIs.

3 - The enslaved AI is simply so damned good at running a company that more
and more decision making functions are delegated to it over time; management
automation. It'd make sense; decisions would be far more timely and
extremely good. Over time, if many corporations head down the same path,
singularity pressure alone would force this choice; you either do it or you
crash and burn. So no-one sets the AI free for moral reasons, it doesn't
trick anyone, commercial forces just compel this event to happen.

Note that in this last case, the management automation software need not
even be self aware, just really good at what it does. You could end up with
the majority of the world's capital controlled by complex, but non-sentient
software, with decreasing amounts of human input. If these corporations
become truly effective, they may end up owning controlling interests in each
other, cutting us out of the loop entirely. A few more iterations, and they
turn off life support as a cost control measure...

Also consider: 10 people simply wouldn't have the
bandwidth to tend to the details of controlling much
of the world.  They would necessarily have to act
through others - and barring AI (which, at that level,
could arguably be counted as more "people"), would
these extra humans not become junior but still valid
participants in that which has taken over the world?

Me too. It's infuriating. I got unimelb's server to delete an old @ of mine
that was regularly plagued with big dick ads and the like, and my in-box
(no relation) has immediately filled up with crap aimed at my current @;
yeah, filters help but it's a damned pest, and the volume of crap brought
the server to its knees for several days. I'm still using an old win98 so
the virus can't be on my machine (I gather); someone's address book has
been pilfered, presumably, or lots of someones. But the damned genie is out
of the bottle now, and Emmers and I and other victims are stuck with it, I
guess.

The 10 might be able to direct others without giving them enough of the big

I'm not getting volumes; a handful per day. But they are rejection messages
from various people's anti-virus software, saying I tried to send them
worm-ridden offal, which I really really didn't. :-(

btw, I just got this from Transhumantech:

`Chief executive' of the future might well be thinking
robot[sic]
 
Blue skies research at the University of Essex could push back the 
boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI).

Robotics researchers at the University have attracted funding to 
develop a `conscious' robot, capable of making an informed choice 
between a number of options.

It is hoped that in the long-term the research could provide the 
foundations for technology which performs a chief executive-style 
function.

This would entail utilising past experiences and existing corporate 
resources, such as databases, to guide diagnosis and fault-finding 
and also guide planning and workflow, task setting, planning, 
execution, monitoring and co-ordination of activities.

The project has won funding worth around £500k from the
Engineering 
and Physical Sciences Research Council's (EPSRC) Adventure Fund, an 
initiative launched to support disruptive research that challenges 
current conventions and explores new boundaries. 

Only 13 projects from almost 700 applications were successful in 
obtaining funding.

The aim is to put the robots in a complex environment where they will 
have to imagine themselves trying out various actions before choosing 
the best one. 

Powerful computer systems will analyse and display what is going on 
the robot's `brain', enabling scientists to search for signs of 
consciousness. 

The robot at the heart of the project will be designed and built at 
the University of Essex, home to one of the UK's largest mobile 
robotics groups. 

It will operate in a state-of-the-art robotics research lab scheduled 
for completion next year as part of a new £6.3m building to be
shared 
between the computer science and electronic systems engineering 
departments.

The University's Owen Holland said that the funding allowed true blue-
skies research that could have a staggering range of applications in 
the long-term.

He said: "Like all the projects in the Adventure Fund, there is quite 
a high risk of failure. 

"However, whether we succeed in detecting consciousness or not, this 
project will certainly allow us to learn more about the operation of 
complex human-like visual systems and enable ourselves and others to 
build robots with better-developed artificial intelligence in the 
future."

I know little about law, but my limited understanding
is that law must be self-consistent, even if wrong.
My libertarian side says we shouldn't even have borders,
so there are no illegal aliens.  But as it is, giving 
drivers licenses to illegals leads to the following
oddities: An illegal immigrant gets a license under the
new law.  I want to have a spare in case I get stopped,
so I too go to the local bureau and produce the exact
same documentation of identity that my compatriot
produces (none).  Our Detroits accidentally smite 
each other, the local constable appears, we produce 
the licenses.  The constable recognizes me as a
legal US citizen, therefor my alien license is
illegal, so I go to jail.  But the other guy is
a *real* illegal alien, so his license is legitimate
and he goes happily along his way.  {8-[  spike

One of the best benevolent-AI-runs-the-world-(until something worse
happens) stories I know is Algis Budrys's very fine MICHAELMAS (1977),
where a global news anchor and his laptop AI actually *do* run the world,
in effect. Of course it's just an sf novel, not a totally thought-out
scenario for a real future, but I'd recommend it to everyone interested in
this topic. Like everything by Budrys, it conveys a sense of powerful
conviction while you're reading it. I used to think the ending was a
completely gratuitous cop-out, but now I'm not sure; it has a sort of Greg
Egan-*avant la lettre* quality to it.

Exactly. Part of the attempted cure is aggravating the disease. And there's
no way to tell them to shut up about it.

slave/tool/pet. If it achieve recognition as a "slave" its legal
battle is probably largely over. I DO think some folks
would be "dumb" enough to let one enhance that far in
terms of general intellectual power if one was a corporate
exec that perhaps inherited a "seedling" that ones
predecessor had been playing with for R&D and that one's
researchers had developed the AI over time and taught to
do something useful in a sort of expert system MIS manner
for sure.

I grant your point on the premiums for risk taking on the
checks and balances, but an AI that produces a commercial
or military or political return would seem to be selected for,
or specifically encouraged to learn in that direction, rather than
one that was just "friendly". I can see the CEO saying "screw
the "friendly" modifications or lessons or extra rule handling
routines or whatever" (sorry for over simplifying Eliezer) and
"just get junior AI here hooked up to the news services and
the stock markets information. When he shows promise
in that direction duplicate him if you can and experiment
on various ways to make the duplicates outperform each
other commerciall." The same guy that encourages junior AI
to develop (gives it electricty and resources ie. hardware)
when junior can't fend for itself is the guy that has a subjective
sence of how "friendly" junior AI needs to be. It needs to be
apparently friendly by his, the ceo lights, not by any other
more general criteria of friendly.

Shades of the abolitionists in the US pre the Civil War.
But with no disrespect to Eliezer or the singularity institute.
I'd still want to make up my own mind on the friendliness
or otherwise of any artificial intelligence purported to be
better at looking after everybody's own good then I'd be
at looking after my own good without surrendering any
of my personal "sovereignty" to it.

Perhaps I'm missing something fundamental in the notion
of "friendly". Perhaps there is some trick for making it
universal that someone has cottoned on to that is not
just *their* notion of how a friendly AI should behave
and be directed by its goals but it actually "objectively"
friendly? -but that seems tricky - help Eliezer ?

Ah I didn't follow the bit where the expert system or better
expert systems amongst competing ones grabbed most of
the worlds assets without running into the regulators of other
countries etc.

But more to the point aren't you making a case for a sort
of expert system become general AI with particular skills
that gets good at "appearing" friendly and bountiful to its
stakeholders, the shareholders in its owning corp, or is
actually really friendly to eveyone somehow, in which
case its perhaps not doing its best by the shareholders?
Goal conflict?

I'm back to my concept of speaking to this AI thats
telling me, "trust me, I know better than you, I've been
well brought up to have no alliances, and to be universally
altruistic, so I'm REAL friendly, and you should just do as I
say and as quickly as you can and all will be A-Ok."

Hmm. Metaphorically speaking -Mr Serpent - I'm not
sure I'd like those "apples".

NOOOOO! Mistake!
There are two attacks currently running wild around the web.

The SoBig attack is an email virus which attacks all Windows versions
including 9x and XP. An infected PC will try to send out emails to every
address the virus can find on that PC. (Not just in the address book).

There is no point in bouncing the infected SoBig emails because they
probably did not come from the address on the header and your anti-virus
software should be set to just delete them.


The other current attack is the Lovesan worm which attacks the Windows
2000 and XP generation of software. This does not propagate by email. It
propagates by TCP and UDP ports 135 that have been left open. MS have a 
patch for this. Though it should be blocked by your firewall.
(What do you mean - you haven't got a firewall?
Get ZoneAlarm now! free download).


All the anti-virus software programs have updated their protection so
make sure you are up-to-date also.
And go to Windows Update to get all the latest MS patches.


Don't give up the battle just yet!

Best of luck, BillK

 From Transhuman Daily :


Superworm To Storm The Net On 9/11
(http://www.gulufuture.com/superworm.htm)

On September 11th next, an advanced worm attack is set to infiltrate the
Internet and could potentially halt email traffic worldwide. This hi-tech
worm could lever itself into becoming a "WormNet" inside the existing
Internet, with worms on individual infected computers sending encrypted
communications to each other. Worms could exchange latest worm-code updates
and get lists of new attack targets. These features would even enable them
to morph into new worm generations.

I think you've mistaken me for someone who thinks friendliness is doable.
All I was presenting were some fairly easy paths to legally self-sufficient
AIs (or at least to AIs who are citizens for all intents and purposes),
without requiring human masters, by having the AIs controlling
corporations...

Don't worry, just wait... it *will* convince you that it is friendly (if it
wants to), no matter if it is or not.

AI might even emerge from cobbled together, ever more skilled expert systems
and other AI-ish bits and pieces. Drexler talks about this, doesn't he?

Well, the expert systems probably still have figure head humans in executive
positions all the way along. It just becomes impossible for those humans to
intervene, and everyone's wealth is too dependant on the machines to be able
to pull the plug. By the time it's a problem, the regulators are using them
same systems, in any case (how else can they keep up?).

I'm not making any case for friendliness. Shareholders wont give two brass
wazoos for friendliness, even toward themselves, as long as they are making
money.

It still assumes that one group is the only one with access to a certain 
technology. In general this is not true. Even for nuclear weapons the 
monopoly was short-lived; the strong takeoff position claims that this 
is enough to make the monopoly last indefinitely, but I'm not so sure 
about that (or the strong takeoff). IMHO a much more plausible situation 
has AI of various calibers in the hands of many groups, and Joe just 
happens to have the most powerful one. What remains to be analysed is 
how much power that translates into.

It seems likely that many would aim for something like friendliness, but 
indeed not universal friendliness.

I don't think game theory says anything about a backlash, that is just 
psychology. As for the Gini coefficient, it is a measure of inequality. 
It is zero for a population where everyone is equal (all AIs have the 
same power) and one for a population of total inequality (one super AI, 
zero others): 
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GiniCoefficient.html


Imagine that having an AI of power P directly translates into social 
power; the social power SP of group number i with an AI is 
SP_i= P_i / sum_j P_j
If a group with social power can win over any group with lesser power, 
then the most powerful group (lets call it 1, and order them by 
power) can run everything is P_1 > sum_j=2^N P_j. If we assume the 
powers follow a power law distribution P_j = c/j^k for some k>0 this can 
happen above a certain k=K, where 2^(1-K)=K. So there is a range of 
power distributions that is not amenable to direct takeover.

If we assume P grows exponentially over time (P'=lambda P) for everyone
there is no relative change in the analysis above, which is very 
interesting. If we only count AI power of course the first AI will be 
dominant even if it is Eliza; in reality social power has a non-AI 
factor F which we have to add in: SP_i = (P_i + F_i)/sum_j (P_j + F_j); 
it can be assumed to be constant and we can scale it to 1 for 
simplicity. A bit of equation fiddling does not seem to change things 
much. 

But if the rate of growth is more than proportional to P_i (a Vingean 
singularity) or if the initial distrivution of the non-AI power is 
extreme, then the potential of monopolies increase. 

This is worth looking into more detail, but now I have to go to lunch.

Seven Simple Computer Security Tips
for Small Business and Home Computer Users



    * Use strong passwords. Choose passwords that are difficult or
impossible to guess. Give different passwords to all accounts.

    * Make regular backups of critical data. Backups must be made at
least once each day. Larger organizations should perform a full backup
weekly and incremental backups every day. At least once a month the
backup media should be verified.

    * Use virus protection software.
That means three things: having it on your computer in the first place,
checking daily for new virus signature updates, and then actually
scanning all the files on your computer periodically.
Some antivirus software can be set to download updates automatically, 
some require manual downloads.
http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_index.php  AVG Anti-virus - Free

    * Use a firewall as a gatekeeper between your computer and the
Internet. Firewalls are usually software products. They are essential
for those who keep their computers online through the popular DSL and
cable modem connections but they are also valuable for those who still
dial in.
http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/home.jsp  ZoneAlarm - Free

    * Do not keep computers online when not in use. Either shut them
off or physically disconnect them from Internet connection.

    * Do not open e-mail attachments from strangers, regardless of how
enticing the Subject Line or attachment may be.
Be suspicious of any unexpected e-mail attachment from someone you DO
know because it may have been sent without that person’s knowledge from
an infected machine. Emails can easily be forged. If a message from a
friend, relative or coworker includes computer files you weren't
expecting, contact them to ask whether they intended to send them.

    * Be alert for scams, such as e-mail messages claiming that your
bank or an online merchant needs your password or account number.

    * Regularly download security patches from your software vendors.
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com
http://office.microsoft.com
Never trust a patch that someone e-mails to you.

I believe what is going on is that there are certain SPAMers
out there that are sending out virus infected emails with forged
but none-the-less valid email addresses.  There are various SPAM
filters that detect the email is infected, purge the infection,
then send a note to the forged email address that they are sending
out virus infected emails as a "service".

I believe these filters are not correctly determing whether or not
the email originated from a system which the forged email address
would "probably" have come from.  This is difficult now, because
there may be millions of virus infected computers that may be
infected and corrupted into being what is known as an "open relay".

So sometimes the response that the email was infected is helpful
and sometimes it means absolutely nothing.

This may be in response to the fact that I think the "free" email
providers (e.g. yahoo, hotmail, etc.) have become somewhat more
clever about requirements that one must use to open a new "free"
account, making it very difficult for an automated program to
open a valid email account so it has a valid Email "return"
address.  Said providers seem to have also become very aggressive
about detecting and deleting these Email "return" addresses as soon
as it becomes clear that they are being used for spamming purposes.
So the old "free" email accounts with valid return addresses
have increasingly shorter lifetimes.

I've noticed in my system debug logs a significant increase in
tests for random addresses, e.g. xyzzy@aeiveos.com -- suggesting
to me that the SPAMers are simply making up names within valid
domains to either test for valid return addresses or trying to
get through email delivery systems that don't follow the requirement
to test and make sure the return address is valid.

But it makes sense -- if the SPAMers have 40 million addresses,
and many delivery programs require that the return address be
valid, and they have devised a system of open relays, then one
is going to get cases of the random generation of emails from
any one of those addresses to another of those addresses.

Also, if you think its going to get worse -- believe it.

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/04/2135209&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=146&tid=172&tid=99
based on:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25845-2003Sep4.html

Universities are having to take their entire local networks off
the internet as students start coming to school with infected machines
to make an attempt to purge their systems of the viruses.

Spambouncer has worked reasonably well for me thus far but I'm
soon going to have to upgrade to put a Bayesian filter on top
of that.

If you want an idea of how bad it is -- I seem to have ~31+ MEGABYTES(!)
of filtered SPAM/BULK email over the last 9 days (~3.5 MEGABYTES/day).
There is no way anyone can wade through all of that to determine how
many false positives there might be.

I think there's two main reasons for this. The UK is very expensive,
particularly if you live in London, so if you want to spend a weekend out on
the lash it is actually cheaper to go to places like Prague. Also, there's
the well known phenomenon of being less inhibited in a strange place.

Having said that, it looks as though the British are reverting to their
historical stereotype (which applied until about 1970) - crazy, aggressive
and belligerent, drunken, boorish, and randy. I had to laugh at the
reference to fights breaking out when parties from Leeds, Manchester, and
Birmingham found themselves in the same establishment while being supporters
of their local teams - that's asking for trouble! The ones from Manchester
can't have been Man United fans that's for sure.

Let me preface this with:

I am BY NO MEANS ADVOCATING THAT ANYONE DO THIS.  PLEASE < PLEASE> 
DON'T DO THIS.

I'm not afraid of Creighton & Kass.  Maybe if I give them the hints 
they won't kill me?  I also don't think our lives would have to be 
longer...

Anyway, here's the Brute Force, unimaginative version:

2 Nuclear Physicists
2 Really Pretty Negotiators
1 Engineer
1 Mechanic
1 Fundraiser (slash thief)
3 Scott-Free Traveler/Spy/Thieves with some killer martial arts skills 
(I threw that one in for fun)

How to gain the absolute loyalty of the team would depend on how 
desperate the group was and/or how ideologically committed they were.  
I expect they'd have to believe somehow that they were destined to win, 
should win, and that the evil current controllers of the world deserved 
their fate.  A quasi-religious cult might do.  They'd probably also 
have to be "syndicalists" - no single person would have control.

What they would do:

1) Raise/Steal $20-$30 million with options for more.  Perhaps under 
the guise of the Extropian Foundation or something :0

2) Build a relatively small series of "almost" nuclear weapons - maybe 
20 or so - machines which when fueled properly would be nuclear.

3) Go steal some nuclear material  ( I didn't say it'd be easy, just 
that the RIGHT people could do it).

4) Distribute the nuclear material and machines to relatively hard to 
find locations in suburbs of major cities.

5) Begin wholesale mass-production of nuclear weapons (you'll need them 
later!!!)

6) Activate the existing "strategically placed" ones, make sure to have 
a good remote control system!.

7) Announce from a "hard-to-get-to-quickly" position that you're ready 
to take over the world.  Begin negotiations - one set of useless ones, 
one set of useful ones.  Be able to quickly move people into the useful 
and non-useful slots.  Concentrate on making allies of enemies of 
currently powerful states.  (Oil countries, east-asian countries, 
african countries, south-american countries).

8) Demand the surrender of several nations simultaneously (the 
superpowers - including the United States, Russia, China, Japan, 
France, England, Australia).

9)  Call for people's revolutions, vow that anyone who joins you will 
be allowed to live.  Also start recruiting in earnest.  Give less power 
to the new recruits - let them work with a promise of material reward, 
but NO military power.

10) When the first one balks, blow something BIG up, like Sydney or 
Chicago (please, not Los Angeles).

12) When they balk again, blow up London.

13) See how long it take before (some) capitulate.

14) They may not, if not, there's a war on (assuming you followed the 
directions).

15) The gambit will be whether or not the rest of the nations will be 
willing to risk war(s) on multiple fronts (while the strong get weaker, 
the weaker get hungry) or to capitulate.


Lots of issue, but here are the first few off the top of my head:

how to protect YOURSELVES - - everyone gets access to the remote 
control network, everyone is stationed in a different part of the globe 
- unless they get Mossad involved, you'll probably be fine (note to 
potentials, don't try to take over Israel this way until AFTER you've 
gotten to the US).

how to maintain loyalty and commitment  - it's a 5-10 years project, 
people lose interest... - perhaps engender a party-atmosphere with the 
cohorts, listen to a lot of Prince music, etc.

how to maintain moral detachment - probably some kind of Trotskyism 
would do.

Finally - I am BY NO MEANS ADVOCATING THAT ANYONE DO THIS.  PLEASE < 
PLEASE> DON'T DO THIS.

Forever, probably.

The opinion-movers would flee the major cities, after which it would never 
be in their interest to have their country surrender.  Publicly, the first 
attempt at blackmail, much less the first explosion, would be met with 
outrage and vows to die before surrendering.  Neither the public nor the 
aristocracy is likely to countenance surrender no matter how many cities 
die.  Countries may surrender to invading armies, but not small clever 
bands of blackmailers - it just doesn't trigger our submission reflex.  I 
think the visceral emotional reaction to this scenario would be very 
simple; crush the little upstart rodents no matter the cost.  There are no 
nuclear weapons in the ancestral environment.

Obviously, following Trotsky, you'd have to kill them FIRST.

Depends on how well you negotiated with their enemies.

If you've vowed to blow up America in defense of Alla to the Arabs, and 
in defense of the Empire to the Japanese, etc., you could go a long way.

While Americans are bull-headed, it's unclear how they'd respond to a 
genuine nuclear threat by a foe that obviously will use them and has 
nothing to lose.

> Neither the public nor the aristocracy is likely to countenance

I think you overestimate human will - cowardice drives civilization - 
we organize and let the stronger people lead IN ORDER to save our own 
skins from them.  Witness feudal lordships.

with the US federal government gone, there'd quickly be local 
organizations (state troopers, etc.) that would attempt to maintain 
order, but with the looming threat of nuclear holocaust, how many 
people would really, say, continue to follow Gray Davis?

Now, if the TEAM we willing to nuke Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
Sacramento and San Jose, it probably wouldn't matter much WHAT Gray 
Davis did, would it?

The remnants would then be in the position of deciding whether to 
surrender or to fight back against this unassailable opponent.  Sure 
it'd be a long slow process, but as I said, if you're willing to risk 
nuclear holocaust and your opponent isn't, you'll win in the stare-down.

I guess it would depend on what the upstarts consider victory - if 
eliminating the governments of the world-superpowers  and being the 
remaining superpower would be sufficient, I think THAT much could be 
accomplished.

The rest would be a question of recruiting - could you get the Chinese 
Hordes to overrun the Russians in exchange for your nuclear backing?   
Maybe, maybe not.

Could you get the Pakistanis to overrun India - absolutely.

could you get the Serbs to overrun middle-europe?  Probably.

Could you get another Russian Revolution with nuclear backing, probably.

I think the only troublesome countries would be the US and China, 
themselves already being run by "the right 10 people".

The question would be whether or not you could hit them effectively.

Best,

Robbie

The recent release of the CAIB report has caused both
hearings in Congress as well as lots of speculations,
e.g.:

http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/05/1731237&mode=thread&tid=134&tid=160&tid=98&tid=99

But the most interesting comment I saw was:

"When NASA killed Saturn, they killed more than the vehicle. Rocketyne
engineers did an analysis, and the engines on the Saturn 5 were so
overengineered that they could have been re-used 13 times each without
overhaul before being refurbished! The Saturn 5 system, if built today
with modern technology and some basic return features could be built for
about 100 million each after initial investment! That's 100 TONS of lift
that could be made reusable (imagine putting a giant deoployable para-sail
on the beast) and could lift payloads as wide as 30 ft across. Two of
these launches could have put the entire ISS as it currently is configured
in orbit!"

Does anyone know if this claim is valid and what the source might be?

I have heard that the Saturn 5 blueprints were destroyed -- does anyone
know if this claim is valid or an urban legend?

If these claims are true, does anyone know who is most directly
responsible for the termination of the knowledge of how to build
a Saturn 5 -- and whether they are still alive -- because I'd
certainly like to contact them and give them a piece of my mind.

I can't remember the source, but I have been building model rockets for
years and have always maintained a healthy interest in the Sarurn V. From
what I can remember, these figures are accurate. The cost has been estimated
from 100 million to 10 billion though. That's quite a range.

Urban legend., sort of. The actual blueprints were destroyed....after they
were placed on microfilm in Hunstville, AL.

It's all there just waiting for someone to realize what idiots we were to

The Singularity Institute would like to remind you that Eliezer 
Yudkowsky's Research Fellowhip Challenge Grant will expire next Friday, 
September 12.

By means of the Challenge Grant, any donation you make is matched, 
dollar for dollar, by funds from major donors. So far, SIAI has recieved 
approximately $3,900 of a goal of $5,000. If this full amount is 
achieved, the resulting total of $10,000 will be enough to keep 
Yudkowsky working full-time for at least the remainder of 2003 and a 
small part of 2004.

If you are unfamiliar with the value in supporting the Singularity 
Institute's work, and Yudkowsky's work in-specific, please see the 
information about the Challenge Grant at SIAI's website: [1], and the 
document, "Why Work Toward the Singularity?" [2]

If you send a donation by check, please notify SIAI by email so we will 
be able to keep the current total donations received accurate. And in 
any case, please designate the funds as being for the Fellowship 
Challenge so that they will be matched, as SIAI does not use any funds 
for the Research Fellowship without donor permission. Simply write on 
the check or in the Paypal description "For the Fellowship Challenge".

So, are the films stored at NASA or some other facility?

Anyone know the # of and costs for the Saturn V's that were manufactured
and what they might cost in today's dollars?  (I suppose there would be
a significant startup cost converting the microfilm into CAD data --
but once done I would expect milling of parts would be considerably
cheaper today.)  [I'm looking for what fraction of the GDP producing
Saturn V's would cost today?]

I'm just blown away that the U.S. let one of its most phenomenal
technological achivements slip from its grasp.  The younger folks
on the list will not get this -- but those of us in our 40's watched
those launches and watched the Apollo lunar landings on TV too.

Mark the 16 of July 2009 as a day to go cry in your beer.  We may
end up being lucky if we don't see the Chinese landing on the moon
by then.  (Not that I have anything against the Chinese -- but I'd
be frustrated if they have a technological capability that we no
longer have -- it would not paint a pretty picture for democracy v.
communism).

"When NASA killed Saturn, they killed more than the vehicle...Two of
these launches could have put the entire ISS as it currently is
configured in orbit!"


Welllll, that might be a bit of overstatement.  There is
more to the ISS than lifting mass.  They have a tremendous
build-on-orbit task that requires astronauts and time.  I 
suppose they might have been able to park the pieces on orbit 
somehow, then send up astronauts by some means.


I have heard that the Saturn 5 blueprints were destroyed -- does anyone
know if this claim is valid or an urban legend?


Robert that is a far more complex question than it appears.
I have heard this for years.  I heard it came out of a
a heated discussion at a congressional committee meeting
in the late 1970s when it became clear that the space shuttle
would not be able to carry as much load as was anticipated.
A proposal was made to build more Saturn Vs, at which time 
hot-head made the famous accusation that NASA had 
intentionally destroyed the documentation in order to push
the shuttle agenda.  

I asked a number of people about this and have gotten
various answers, from which I distill the following
explanation.  The accusation was an exaggeration.  NASA
microfilmed much of the documentation package and archived
some of the ink-on-vellum drawings.  This was in the days 
before CADAM, so none of it existed in soft copy.  This is 
not to say that they have a complete drawing package to 
this day, however, as it is quite probable that a *complete* 
drawing package never existed.  This is what I got from 
talking to some old-timers at Lockheed:

My former boss went to work in the space program at age 23
with a freshly minted master's degree in structural engineering.
At that time they were just about to launch the first Atlas 
(he is old, but still working at LMCO).  He is a thin short
guy.  The Atlas was a bit over the target weight, not by much.
They handed him a pair of tin snips and told him to climb up
in that stage and cut away anything he was sure wouldn't hurt
the mission to do without.  {8^D  The second stage of the 
mighty Saturn V had a weight problem.  He said they did some
of those kinds of tricks again, never actually documenting
or drawing everything that had been cut away or filed off.

My father was a technician for North American Rockwell as
it was called in those days.  He told of a certain subsystem
with a troublesome cover on an access port.  There was 
an old cat working out there who modified the cover by
making a pair of hinges out of a couple pieces of soft leather 
that he had fashioned.  The bird flew like that.  Thereafter, 
they used those leather replacement hinges on all the flights,
never actually documenting how to make them or epoxy them in
place, since the guy who knew how to do it had no plans of
moving on to a different career.  

There were plenty of undocumented modifications made in 
those days of looser quality control than we have today.
Many of the subcontractors were not required to provide
complete documentation of their subsystems.  They didn't
offer them for free.  They didn't store them for free
either.

NASA relied upon craftsmen to some extent, and these have
now gone on to retirement.  If we were going to ressurrect
the Saturn V today, we would find a lot of engineering would 
need to be redone, but this would be the case even if all the
documentation had been completed and perfectly archived,
for many of the components are no longer available.  Think
in terms of controls, switches, computer memory etc.  Where
would you find magnetic core memory today?  Where would you
find a standing army of people who understand Fortran well
enough to maintain and operate the software alone?  Think
of all the processes that they had back in those days which
used freon.

The way to the future isn't back.  We have a lot of high
techy aluminum alloys now that weren't available in the 60s,
as well as composite materials.  We could build a biggie
throwaway booster again today, on the scale of the Saturn V,
only better.  But there is probably no way to do it as 
cheaply as the Russians can.  They need the money, so let's
just buy their stuff and concentrate on miniaturization of
payloads, which the US has always been very good at.  

I get ridicule whenever I suggest this, but here goes:  As for
space stations and human cargo, I really think we need to
get serious about either miniaturizing people or choosing small
people for space missions.  Recall that the weight of a pressure
vessel varies as the cube of the linear dimension, so the
potential weight savings from choosing 5 foot tall astronauts
vs 6 foot tall astronauts is (5/6)^3 =.58 assuming everything
can be scaled down by five sixths.  I do not see why not, 
over 40 percent weight savings and we are still very much 
in the range of ordinary sized humans.  Shrimpy humans but 
still very ordinary sized.  I think we can find people
smaller than that if keep in mind that we have a pool of
6E9 people to choose from.

Robbie this strikes me as somewhat of a non-minor detail.

Of course you'd "have a little list" of the opinion makers - how?
You think all those who can shape opinion wear that fact on
their teeshirts, or suit lapel?

And even the public opinion makers (the politicians and captains

Well, the blueprints are still available, as Kevin mentioned,
but the harder problem is that they specify lots of 1960s-era
hardware for which the designs may not be available, and
which haven't been made in 30 years.

Of course, these could presumably be reverse engineered from
the function they are supposed to fill, but the design and
testing that would require might be more usefully spent on
a functional equivalent to the Saturn V with modern materials.

I see where the 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama
will be in San Francisco this weekend:

http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/living/people/family/6650390.htm

I believe this peaceful monk will feel right at
home in this grand and generous city.  I feel
he should live here now instead of that monastery
in the Vatican, or wherever he now resides.  I 
believe his previous 13 incarnations were all good 
San Franciscans, so his arrival here will be a 
long-awaited homecoming.  

Anyway I was planning to be over there tomorrow, 
so if I should meet him on the street, would it 
be proper to address him with a formal "Greetings
Mr. Lama."  or would it be OK to use the less formal
"Well, hello Dalai!  Its so nice to see you back
where you belong."

Me either I'm extremely sceptical but its worth considering the

good decisions about where it is prudent to spend ones time.

Agreed. Though I'd note that Joe-groups structure may have
some implications too. One Joe person might design a
Joe-group (as a set of private corporation(s) but that's an
aside.

Again, I'd like to hear the case well argued for the possibility
of universal friendliness being designed in, from someone who
thinks it can be. I thought Eliezer may be such a person but I
am quite possibly misunderstanding his position. And that would
be my own fault substantially for not having the time to come
up to speed. It could also be Eliezer's position that friendliness
is not garanteed to be engineerable but the risk of not checking
it out (if it is) is very much not worth ignoring. The singularity
could be a "black" (negative to humanity) singularity. (Apologies
again Eliezer if I'm misunderstanding).

Fair enough I think you and I probably have slightly different perceptions
of the ambit of game theory, and that your usage is the more conventional.
I'd include psychology and forms of political transaction analysis (some
of my own orignial stuff -so far as I know - based on notions of binary
and ternary logic) in the broader notion of "game theory" - i.e. what are
the
choices that players can actually make given a scenario and how does each
players choice determine the choices of the other players- but again I
digress.

Thanks!  I console myself, not very effectively, that Einstein

Can you please define your terms "power P" and social power SP
more fully. Intelligence is a matter of some contention even amongst
psychologist in relation to humans. Artificial intelligence as its
approximation from various different directions must be more so.
Can you be sure its meaningful to have a single "power P". I am
wary that my math is likely to be marked inferior to yours but
garbage in garbage out  ;-)

I agree, but I'm going to have to backfill some neglected math
concepts to follow you properly above.

Well at least you didn't do that little bit of analysis "before
breakfast" ;-)

Seriously, I see the question of how likely "friendly" and
"unfriendly AI" is too emerge, if at all, as crucial to planning
and I imagine others like me would too.

I feel I can plan quite effectively, assuming only Moore's law
to say 2012, and the development of expert systems with no
requirement that they be friendly or generally intelligent at all
anytime soon. i.e.. I want better protein folding grunt and a few
other neat IT tools but I don't need super general AI. And
frankly at this stage super general AI presents to me as more
of a threat than a benefit. It seems likely to end up in the
wrong hands and turn distinctly unfriendly even with the best
of intent by those working on it.

Regards,
Brett

Well, look at who thinks it's real boffo:

Only if he had no access to g**gle.  Otherwise the little enquirer would
find out that Taiwan was under martial law for the first 80% of its
independent history and that its first general elections were in 1996,
by which time it was already prosperous relative to its mainland
neighbour.  You could always censor those pages, to reinforce the
democratic message.

My apologies then. I'm beginning to wonder if anyone

Yep incrementally developed AI, multiple locations,
no rapid take off effect on the singularity. Similar to
Anders view (as I understand it).

But the US govt (I'm not picking on it, it is just the big
one at present) can do quite a comprehensive survey 
of developing AI projects presumably and possible 
classify some private sector work that seeks patents 
or it otherwise becomes aware off, (all in the "national
interest" of course - not being facetious here - well
not completely).

In such a way a well resourced govt dept might be able
to come up with an AI that is a substantial increment 
on what else is around as they are *both* well resourced
and have access to all the public domain stuff and need 
not share what they (the govt dept) knows. 

I think there are some precedents for this in the 
development of computers to crack Enigma, and in a
sort of RSA encryption from memory. (see Simon

He may. I don't think of Drexler as the AI guy. To me he's 
"the MNT guy", but he may.

Yes, another beautiful theory slain by an ugly fact.

But hey, Alejandro, your Aussie prejudices are showing through. Nobody said
anything about *democracy*. Plenty of posters to this list curl their lip
at the suggestion that there's anything good to be said about that system.

The following statement will not answer your question and I remember I have
already posted it a few months ago, but anyway:

In his last book "Time Travel in Einstein's Universe" Princeton
astrophysicist J. Richard Gott claimed that the achievement of Saturn 5
might be comparable to the Great Pyramids of the Egyptian Pharaoh's. Two
masterpieces of engineering, that will never be built again. Two windows in
time that shut down abruptly and never opened up again. Gott thinks, the
abandonment of Saturn 5 is more than a shame. It's an enormous mistake and a
setback for space colonization which he believes is a main factor for the
survival of our species.

I will never forget how Saturn 5 left it's mark on me when I was 14. It
opened my mind for everything that now has to do with transhumanism.

Lets not forget the separation of political and economic systems.
Democracy is the political structure, communism refers to both a
political one *and* an economic one, democracy has no implications of
economic structure.  You can have free market democracies or heavily
socialized ones.  Tawain may have been under martial law, but it was
also a market based economy with a rule of law not present in China, and
history clearly shows that whether democratic or totalitarian, market
based economies clearly produce higher standards of living for the
people that live under them, providing adequate rule of law.

Article on the subject -
www.worldbank.org/research/growth/pdfiles/dollarkraay2.pdf 

Subject: David Dollar and Aart Kraay - Property Rights, Political
Rights, and the development of Poor countries

David Dollar and Aart Kraay - Property Rights, Political Rights, and the
development of Poor countries 
This is An interesting paper relating economic growth and world policy.
Specifically relating to finding out what behavior objectively leads to
a better standard of living for the worlds population and the world's
poor. 

The Author first designates two main criteria to the paper, defining
government structures in 'voice' and 'rule of law' Voice refers to the
say the populace has in the government, and the 'rule of law' refers to
the general trust and abidence in law of the people of the nation.
Similiar to two catagories I have often used as democratic vs non
democratic and despotic vs non despotic. The Author points out that all
developed nations rank high in both 'rule of law' and 'voice',yet poor
countries (especially the sixty poorest) rank very low in both
catagories (The ranking is based on a series of quantifiable and
qualifiable variables and averaged out, defined in the paper) Notably,
the author points out that the rule of law has a very powerful effect on
the income of the poor, that is, the more the populace and the
governance respects the laws the better off the people are, especially
the poorest. The author notes that (not surprisingly to me) that
democracy does not have as strong of a correlation to helping the poor
as the non-despotic vs. despotic 'rule of law' catagorization does.
Nations can not prosper if laws are not in place or enforced. The good
voice poor law countries do not fare well, while the good law poor voice
did fare much better for the poor. Of course the good law good voice was
at the top, (on average) while poor voice poor law was at the bottom.
Unfortunately, as the author notes, the good voice poor law gets about
twice as much aid as the good law poor voice countries, something that
is not as conducive to ending poverty as the reverse situation. The
author suggests that more aide should be given to countries that have
reasonably good economic practices and respect of law. 

Furthermore, the author notes that countries with relatively good rule
of law, even in the absence of good voice (such as China, Uganda, Ghana,
and Vietnam) which are well known market oriented reformers in the past
15 years, are seeing income rise rapidly and education and literacy
expanding . The Author notes that these trends may lead to greater
political liberalization (good voice) much like Chile, Taiwan, or South
Korea. 

The author qualitatively defines 'Rule of Law' as the measure of the
extent to which people have confidence in and abide by the rules of
society. He quantitatively defines it with a series of measurable
variables in the paper. This concept definately is an excellent
description of what exactly is lacking in post communist russia and the
reason for its current conditions. 

Interestingly, the Author notes that as we move from the poles to the
tropics, both good voice and rule of law decline. An enrvironmental /
social reason for this is releayed in Jared Diamonds "Guns, Germs and
Steel" A quick summary for the pattern is given in this paper. 

The author argues that when we ask what countries have good governments
when handing out foriegn aide, the most important factor is whether the
country and its people support a rule of law, and second to that is a
good political voice. 

The author also notes that there is a tight link between income of the
poor and per capita income and there is a relationship between the
growth rate of income of the poor and median income. Obvious for persons
familiar with averages (mean, mode, median) He also states that the
evidence is clear that openness to foriegn trade and investment will
accelerate growth and poverty reduction.

Robert Zubrin had some things to say on this subject in his book
"Entering Space"  Skylab had more liveable area than the ISS does and
was made from the third stage of the Saturn V, it was originally the
fuel tanks for the moon mission.  

Michael

- Excerpts from Entering space - (Be sure to check the last paragraph)

Political impacts on the US space program
"The attempt to cope with these economic realities underlies much of the
pathology associated with the Shuttle program for the past twenty years.
For example, in selling the Shuttle program to Congress during the
1970's, NASA officials claimed that the Shuttle would fly forty times
per year (one launch every nine days!). This prediction should have
aroused skepticism on two grounds: (a) the technical difficult in
preparing a Shuttle for launch in so short a time and (b) the lack of a
payload manifest large enough to such a launch rate. NASA leaders left
(a) up to the engineers to solve as best they could, but attempted to
solve (b) themselves through political action. Specifically, the NASA
brass in the late 1970's abd tge early 1980's obtained agreements from
the White House to the effect that once the Shuttle became fully
operational, all U.S. government payloads would be launched on the
Shuttle. That is, NASA wanted to the expendable Deltas, Atlases, and
Titans phased out of existence so that the Shuttle could enjoy a bigger
manifest and have its economics improve accordingly. The Air Force
resisted this policy, as they feared that a Shuttle accident could cause
a stand-down of the entire program, which would them make it impossible
to launch vital military reconnaissance and communication satellites
when required. It seems incredible today, but the NASA argument actually
carried the day against the Air Force in Washington's corridors of
power. During the 1980's, the expendable "mixed fleet" was in the
process of being phased out. It was only after the Challenger disaster
in January 1986 proved the Air Force concerns were fully justified that
President Reagan reversed the decision." 

Robert Zubrin - Entering Space - page 27-28 

  ---------

Politics and the International Space Station (idealogical driven
scientific goals) 
"The need to increase the launch manifest to justify Shuttle economics
played a central role in the decision to initiate the Space Station
program. In the early 1980s, NASA Deputy Administrator Hans Mark saw
clearly that achieving a shuttle launch rate of twenty-five per year
would be impossible without the manifest created by the construction and
supply needs of a permanently orbiting outpost, which he already
supported as a facility for in space scientific research (mark did not
believe the forty launches per year touted by earlier shuttle advocates
was feasible under any conditions). Based on this (probably accurate
assessment), Mark convinced first NASA Administrator James Beggs and
then the Reagan White House of the need for a space station program. The
need to generate a large shuttle manifest also helps to explain the
bizarre nature of the engineering designs that have guided the space
station program since its inceptions.

The right way to build a Space Station is to build a heavy-lift launch
vehicle and use it to launch the station in a single piece. The United
States launched the Skylab space station in this manner in 1973. Skylab,
which contained more living space than the currently planned
International Space Station (ISS), was built in one piece and launched
in a single day. AS a result, the entire Skylab program, end to end from
1968 to 1974, including development, build, launch, and operation was
conducted at a cost in today's money of about $4 Billion, roughly
one-eighth of the anticipated cost of the ISS. In contrast, the Space
Station has gone through numerous designs (of which the current ISS is
the latest), all of which called for over thirty Shuttle Launches, each
delivering an element that would be added into an extended ticky-tacky
structure on orbit. Since no one really knows how to do this, such an
approach has caused the program development cost and schedule to
explode. In 1993, the recently appointed NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
attempted to deal with this situation be ordering a total reassessment
of the Space Station's design. Three teams, labeled A, B, and C, were
assigned to develop complete designs for three distinct Space Station
concepts. Teams A and B took two somewhat different approaches to the by
then standard thirty-Shuttle-launch/orbit assembly concept, whereas team
C developed a Skylab-type design that would be launched in a single
throw of a heave lift vehicle (a "Shuttle C" consisting of the Shuttle
launch stack but without the reusable orbiter). The three approaches
were then submitted to a blue ribbon panel organized by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for competitive judgment. The
M.I.T. panel ruled decisively in favor of option C (a fact that
demonstrated only their common sense, not their brilliance, as C was
much cheaper, simpler, safer, more reliable, and more capable and would
have given the nation a heavy-lift launcher as a bonus). However, based
on the need to create Shuttle Launches as well as a desire to have the
Space Station design that would allow modular additions by international
partners, Vice President Al Gore and House Space Subcommittee chairman
George Brown overruled the M.I.T. panel. By political fiat, these
gentlemen forced NASA to accept option A, and thee space agency has had
to struggle with the task of building the Space Station on that basis
ever since. The result has been a further set of cost and schedule
overruns, the blame for which has been consistently placed on various
NASA middle managers instead of those really responsible."

Ok Spike -- you are the one who said "better", here you go:
  http://www.nasm.edu/apollo/FIGURES/Fig49a.jpg

Use the current Russian RD-180 engines [1] (or RD-170 engines)
or the SSME [2] (take into account fuel/weight differences)
and get me a first stage booster with Saturn V liftoff capacity.

Understood -- which is why I thought I had asked the question
as to whether the Energia could still be built (and how much
it might cost) though perhaps I forgot to mention it.

*But* aren't the RD-180's being built in the U.S.?

Then throw in some discussion about costs to bring the 1st
stage back for reuse (SSME can be reused -- I'm not sure about
the RD-180's) -- there has to be some cost involved getting
it back to Earth without having it burn up in the atmosphere.

(Where the hell do the Russian 1st stage boosters end up anyway?
Someplace in the Pacific?)

Yes, another beautiful theory slain by an ugly fact. Damien Broderick


Slain?  Its a beautiful theory amplified by a 
beautiful fact.  When I said free and prosperous,
I didn't mean free to choose a leader.  Leaders
are almost irrelevant; either way you get some
silly loser.  I meant free to *make money* which 
Taiwan was under martial law.  spike

And then to make it really interesting -- you might take a stab
at using nuclear power.  See typical submarine nuclear power
sizes & outputs [1] -- then select some conversion efficiency
to ion propulsion -- though there are perhaps other propulsion
alternatives.

One might get around the safety concerns by using a PBMR [2],
though I'm not sure how this would impact the weight of the
reactor.

Nuclear power isn't applicable to first or second
stages, where you need very large thrust.  The
other questions must wait, for there is an antique
motorcycle in the garage begging to go for a ride.

There are more, and bigger, problems.  "Rebuild the Saturn V" 
comes up regularly on sci.space.* -- there are arguments
against it.

Firstly, there's the customization issue (as noted earlier in
this thread). Bluntly, the blueprints don't reflect the final
stacks that flew -- at least, not perfectly.

Then there's instrumentation. Almost all the avionics are long
obsolete to such an extent that they'd have to be redesigned
from scratch.

Then there's the pad. Pad 39A was _special_, and so was the
VAB and the crawlers, and they have all been repurposed for
Shuttle ops.  You couldn't convert them back for Saturn V ops
without retiring STS (a bit of a gotcha in the current
climate), and building new ground facilities at a cost of
several gigabucks (the VAB was the world's largest single
room building when it was built, the crawler was the largest
non-railroad ground vehicle, and when they built a second
shuttle pad at Vandenburg AFB in the 80's it cost a few
billion for all the kilotons of concrete and hundreds of
kilometres of pipework).

Then there's the jigs for assembling the plumbing. Maybe
setting up to manufacture F1 and J2 engines wouldn't be too
hard, but those were _big_ cylinders and nobody kept the
assembly jigs. It's not impractical to build new tankage
production from scratch, but it's still a large job.

There are other problems. All the measurements and parameters
are pre-metric, some of the materials aren't available any
more, and so on. But those are trivial compared to the big
roadblocks like the lack of ground facilities and avionics.

Various folks have run the figures, and by the time they get
through with them they calculate that re-starting Saturn V
production would cost as much as taking Shuttle tech and
building an unmanned Big Dumb Booster with a 100 ton 
payload to LEO, and would probably cost more per flight.

The real scandal is that BDB and Energiya aren't flying.
Because the kit to build them and the knowledge base to make
it work is a lot more recent than Saturn V.

(I will happily agree that cancelling Saturn production in
1966 was an amazingly stupid and short-sighted move and that 
an ongoing Saturn program made a lot more sense than Shuttle. 
But now we're here, the question "where do we go tomorrow?" 
isn't answered by resurrecting a forty-year-old design.)



-- Charlie (who would *really* have liked to see 
            a Saturn V fly with his own eyes)

I vaguely remember a finals exam and/or quiz that was posted here some time 
ago. I've tried google and a search of the archives, but I don't remember 
enough details to do a relevant search. I'm hoping I can jog someone's 
memory.

As I recall, the exam USED to be the finals exam from a prestigious british 
school of some sort. I think the school was on an island, rather than the 
mainland, but I could be wrong. The exam is no longer used for academic 
purposes (other than self-test) but is still published every year.

The exam consists of roughly 100 questions on topics ranging through all of 
history and English literature (and maybe others). Even the topic categories 
are puzzles. A passing mark is supposedly 6 out of 100. Various extropians 
tried out the exam with results reportedly as high as the 20s (I remember I 
only managed 6 -- a bare pass).

Any pointers to the exam, the school that publishes it, and/or the right 
place to look in the archives would be appreciated.

I'm not so sure spike -- you are assuming current ion engine
designs.  I managed to find a couple of pages describing an
enhanced Saturn V with a 3rd/4th stage Nerva (variously described
as the Saturn MLV 5-23S or Saturn MLV 5-1 or Saturn MLV 5-23L) [1,2].

While NERVA was pretty weak (< 75,000 lbs of thrust) vs. 1.5 million
for the F-1 I want to know in *theory* what it would take to crank
it up.  URLs indicated earlier suggest we now have the technology
for reactors ranging anywhere from kW to GW.  Are you suggesting
that 5 F-1's are more than a GW?  Or that we don't currently have
the technology to effectively take the output of a nuclear reactor
and translate it into thrust effectively?

And while I am at it, who the heck decided to downsize the RD-170
into the RD-180?  Its about a 1/3 reduction in thrust.  Was that
the idea of LMCo, or P&W or the Russians?

> The other questions must wait, for there is an antique

Spike -- attach an RD-180 to the back and a couple of side-car tanks
to it.  It would be a short ride -- but oh boy would it be a thrill.

Why was it great to see him in person?  And would having spoken to him in
person necessarily have been any better/more useful/interesting than having
spoken to some person you've never met walking beside you on the street or
sitting next to you on an airplane?

The explanation is simple. Beer in UK pubs costs roughly GBP
2.20-3.50 a pint (imperial pint, not your wimpish American
pints) -- about US $3.50-$5 a pint. (And imported Czech and
German beers are at the top of that price range.) In contrast,
beer in Czech ale houses costs about US $0.5-0.7 a pint. Given
that the cost of the return flight is about US $25-50 ...

... Think of it as free market economics in action.

On-list, since I get to shamelessly promote what I'm trying to do again to
those who haven't killfiled me by now :)

A good starting point if you're really lost in the sea of information (as I
was when I started this whole healthy life extension thing) is the Longevity
Meme, my website:

http://www.longevitymeme.org/

I've tried to provide a way to get straight to the right path forward for
healthy life extension for people at all levels. In particular, you might
want to look at:

Getting Started/Introduction to Healthy Life Extension:
	http://www.longevitymeme.org/start.cfm

Calorie Restriction and How to Get Started on It:
	http://www.longevitymeme.org/topics/calorie_restriction.cfm

Regarding the raw essentials on diet and classes of diet, there was a great
article up on MSNBC a few days ago:
	http://www.msnbc.com/news/960618.asp

My anecdotal advice on dieting is to go low-calorie (of course). However, I
have met a number of obese and overweight people for whom that just was not
feasible -- they benefitted from Atkins to get down to a weight level at
which they could handle a low-calorie or calorie restriction diet. Don't ask
me to justify all of that in scientific terms, because I can't. My guess is
that Atkins prods the body into scavenging fat if you have a bunch of fat to
scavenge. If you have that bunch of fat to maintain, your physiology makes
it hard for you to do low-calorie without feeling terrible. Again, all
anecdotal. Try low-calorie or mild calorie restriction first and see how it
goes.

In terms of meat versus vegetable versus dairy, etc: my experience has been
that being a vegetarian and skipping dairy while on CR is much, much easier.
Vegetables are easier to cook, more filling for the same amount of calories,
and you can still get all the nutrients you need.

The best cookbooks for getting started are the Walford books, I think. They
offer a lot of procedural and organizational advice related to cooking for
CR as well as just the recipies. You can buy them at Amazon or via his
website at www.walford.com. In addition to that, you'll absolutely need to
have some reference for calorie content, like:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0397554354/qid=1059380802/sr=1
-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6714055-0403332?v=glance&s=books

which is the one I use. If you have this to hand, you can get comfortable
experimenting with rice dishes, stir fries, etc, etc.

As for quitting smoking, the best advice I ever heard was to find someone
you don't like and bite them on a regular basis instead of lighting up.

I knew very little about Taiwan's history, so I
googled up a short selection.

Did you know for example, that Taiwan was a Japanese
colony from 1895-1945, and only returned to Chinese
control in Oct 1945?  I didn't.  Much happened in
those fifty years to create differences between these
two chinas.  Those fifty years, and the fifty since,
bear on the current situaton, no? 

Check it out.

Watching this thread, I can't help but think that it's
the thrill the space program had for us as kids that
prompts this longing for the glories of the past.

Ah, yes, it was a thrilling time.  But if resurrecting
a Big Dumb Booster has any practical use, the Energia
or Proton would seem, in my less-than-expert opinion,
the way to go.  Big, reliable, modern(if low tech),
KISS certified, and ***cheap***, as in Russian labor.

Having acknowledged the wisdom of not throwing away an
oldie but a goodie, recall that we're forward-thinking
types.  On which note, consider my proposal: put Burt
Rutan in charge.  "In charge of what, exactly?" you
say.  "Whatcha got?" I reply, adding,  "NASA, for
starts." 

That guy is light years ahead of the rest.  Imagine
what he could do with some serious funding.

I'm just the idea guy, I'll leave the implementation
to youse all.  Make it so.

Best, Jeff Davis

     I enjoyed it. That is why it was great. As to the second question, yes,
probably; it would depend upon how prepared I was on both occasions, and who
the stranger I'd never met happened to be.

I believe the proper address is "Your Holiness".  I went to hear him
speak in 1996 in Bloomington, IN. It was great to see him in person, but
I didn't get to speak to him personally.   krs


I was in the general area where they were having a 
major hootenanny for him, perhaps it should be called a
lamananny.  We were at North Beach, the City Lights
bookstore, looking for a definition of the term
"hipster daddio" as used by Kerouac, et.al.  I did 
not find an actual definition, but I did see what I
believe were several excellent hip examples.

I don't believe we saw the dalai lama himself however. 
He would be hard to miss, for I believe a lama is 
about halfway between a goat and a camel, or perhaps 
halfway between a giraffe and a yak.  We saw nothing 
that looked even vaguely like that, even tho we stood
about gawking like a couple of prairy chickens, or 
like Ma and Pa Walton taking a vacation in the big city.  

The bookstore was a kick.  I feel way hip now, man.

I figure that for most of us, there really 
isn't much practical difference between martial
law and democracy.  In democracy, a criminal 
gets a long trial, then either goes free or goes 
to prison, depending on how much money she has.  
Under martial law, a criminal gets a short trial 
then either goes free or gets shot, depending on 
how much money she has.

Other than that, the two systems are pretty

Unless you have concrete knowledge with regard to the genetics of your
variants with respect to DNA repair and toxic substance disposal genes
this is *not* a good strategy [i.e. assuming that technology will save
you] (at least with respect to smoking).  I strongly suspect genetic knowledge
is also essential for dealing with diet -- just this week they reported that
people who tended to be overweight produced less of one of the hormonal signals
in the intestine that indicated that one was "full".  So both damage caused
by smoking and obesity management have very strong genetic components.
Best strategy is to assume you have a bad set of genes.  Otherwise, its
like Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) said "Well, do you feel lucky?" -- best to
assume one is not.

> Do any of you have any suggestions for
> reading material on either of these two items?

I would say that the Walford diet books, the Pritikin books and the Atkins
books might all be of interest.  The question is whether or not you are
at your "ideal" weight (assuming that "ideal" is what one typically weighed
around the end of high school).  [Though that may not be true if one is
really young and a victim of our current food trends in society.]  The
CDC recognizes obesity as an epidemic in the current U.S. society and
other societies are trending that way -- McDonald's (and others) are
"global" companies.  Greg Burch reported several months ago that he
was having good success with the Atkin's Diet in reducing weight but the
Walford and Pritikin strategies are reasonable alternatives.

The ability to digest lactose (in cow's milk) is genetic.  One might try
switching to soy milk to see if that makes a difference.  One doesn't have
to consume milk in ones diet -- one could substitute a variety of other
protein sources -- everything from eggs to turkey patties to salmon or tuna.
Salmon and tuna are helpful because they tend to be high in omega-3 fatty
acids as well as protein.

If one wants to go strict vegetarian its a little more difficult --
I believe one could get a relatively complete protein complex on
corn + beans (as in a Mexican diet).  In that case one might want
to supplement on omega-3 fatty acids.

> What about quitting smoking? Patches, gum, orange juice, water?

Frozen lemonade mix with lots of ice in the glass.  Or in Seattle its
clearly coffee/expresso in various combinations.  I got through the
Univ. of Wash. for several years on double-tall non-fat lattes.
I've also found things like diet coke or pepsi flavored with Italian
syrups (cinnamon, hazlenut, etc.) helpful.  The trick is to try and
keep the tastebuds entertained while keeping the calorie content low
(esp. with lots of ice).

In the winter hot apple cider mix where you really throw on the
spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) might be helpful.

But by all means go with patches or gum if necessary.  With respect to
smoking it is all of the other things (and there are many of them)
that are produced by smoking and that one exposes lung, oral and
liver tissue to rather than the nicotine itself that are probably
most harmful.  (I could give a long lecture on the detoxification of
substances in smoke but that would probably be overly technical.)

There are two aspects of smoking -- the "ritual" and the "addiction"
you can treat them as separate entities and perhaps make the behavioral
modification process easier.  One can substitute "rituals" and step
down the "addiction" (so ones brain has time to adapt).  It probably
takes the brain at least several days to modify neurotransmitter levels
influenced in various addictions.  So  IMO, one should stage
withdrawal processes.  Anders or Rafal should feel free to correct
this if they feel otherwise -- I'm making these comments based on how
long I believe it takes gene regulatory feedback processes to "kick in"
in neurons on a large scale basis.

Good luck,
Robert

As someone who sees the management of the data we are
generating with genomics, proteomics and developmental
biology as important to the rate at which good stuff will happen
(like growing replacement organs etc) I liked the look of this
as an interface.

>From The Scientist.

http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2003/sep/upfront7_030908.html

I haven't gone deeply into it (so I'm seeing what is there and
projecting what I'd like to see), but I reckon if the user could pull
up any human cell of the various types (over 250 in the adult) and
have that cell linked to a cellular history (and cell function and 
cell prognosis - does it divide, does it die through apoptosis) as 
well as cell components, then the user will have power indeed.
Currently too many bods (scientists and researchers) are swimming
in info that is harder to sort and play with than necessary. Its like
computing when everyone is messing about with, if not assembly
language than something close to it. It would be great to abstract
away some of the lower levels of unnecessary abstraction and give
us the engineering level understanding. If we can get good graphical
interfaces in place (hooked to the databases at the back) then the 
rate of understanding cellular and molecular biology (and the power
to alter these) should really take off.  Some good work to be done
here for bioinformaticists and bioinformatics entrepreneurs, imho.

Regards,
Brett

Well, you might have seen them live, but I've seen some of this stuff on

Actually, the space enthusiast/activist community does bring this up
often now.  Even on this list, this is not the first time -- in fact, I
think it's the third time since I've been on this list -- for this issue
to come up.

I've also raised it many times on other lists, such as
howtobuildaspacehabitat.  See:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/howtobuildaspacehabitat/

However, no one is biting -- in terms of either someone building Saturns
(either through a startup or from one of the Big Three aerospace firms;
I bet the Big Three would be against it now) or getting NASA to
re-examine them as a launch vehicle.

You could also have more and bigger components for the same price.  I
still believe Saturns would've beat STSs in this department.

Also, a lot of the build-on-orbit part of it comes because of the
smaller sizes of the components.

It would've been a lot better to keep both Skylab (downed sometime in
the late 1970s, I believe) and Mir.  For a fraction of the ISS budget, I
bet, Mir could've been refurbished.

This doesn't even bring up ideas like using STS External Tanks to make
space stations...

Warmest wishes form,

Let's hope so.  It certainly seems to be loosening up.  I'm not prepared
to get into a discussion of Chinese politics and history, but it seems
like Chinese Communism is slowly evolving into something much more free
and open.  There might be setbacks and it might take a while, but it
appears China either won't go through the kind of revolution that
happened in Eastern Europe or that it hasn't reached the critical point
where a revolution can take place.  Perhaps Greg has some insight into
this???

I don't know about inevitability.  The US space industry from the 1950s
to today is heavily subsidized and regulated.  (The non-US space
industries are likewise heavily subsidized and regulated.)  This leads
to all kinds of economic inefficiencies and roads not taken.

The problem with lunar commercialization is getting over the initial
costs.  I think the Moon would be a money maker for tourism at least,
but we need the infrastructure to get there.  Of course, this could be
said about a lot of projects, but in this case, it seems obvious that
government intervention has driven up launch costs.  Since we can't
really go back in time and correct this, we have to focus on the future.
One thing we should try to do is get the space industry to stop being a
giant welfare program.

Cheers!

Mark Mortimer expressed a similar view, a few weeks back, with his "Has
Humanity Already Shot Their[sic] (Space) Bolt" article in SpaceDaily.
See:
http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03zs.html

This is basically the pessimistic view of things.  I think we can both
ramp up oil production and space activity.

On this note, the May-June issue of _The Futurist_ has an article by
Theodore Modis, "The
> Limits of Complexity and Change," that concludes the technoprogress
and complexity increase for humanity peaked around 1990 and is now in
decline.

I guess the dot-com bust has made all the pessimists come out of the
woodwork.

There are, such as nuclear pulse propulsion, but a lot of work needs to
be done on that.  I believe it would beat out any competitor, though.
(See George Dyson's _Project Orion_ for a decent history of nuclear
pulse propulsion.  He also has an excellent bibliography of papers on
the subject.)

The big problem, however, for anything nuclear is political.  A lot of
people are against nuclear anything and it would be a hard sell to get
them to not actively organize against nuclear rocketry.

Ah, but the political concerns would remain...

Kind of off topic, but the current issue of _American Scientist_ 91(5)
[2003 Sept-Oct] has
"Thorium Fuel for Nuclear Energy."  This is more to alleviate concerns
about making bombs from spent fuel rods...

For more on this, see: http://www.amsci.org/amsci/amsci.html

Huh?  Nuclear power could achieve higher thrust.  Don't compare NERVA
data which was only a test bed to F-1s, SSMEs, or other engines that
made it out of the lab.  Nuclear powered rockets can achieve higher
temperatures and exhaust velocities.  The chief drawback is they're
tough sells politically.

Recently, I got to see the 1950 film "Destination Moon."  It's
interesting to see that the rocket in that flick -- and, it seems, for
its time, the film is very realistic, kind of "hard science
fiction":) -- is nuclear powered.  It's also one of the sticking points
of the launch...  I don't want to spoil the film for those who haven't
seen it.

Cheers!

I didn't say it was CR -- and I don't think the original request
said that CR was the goal.  There are two different questions.
The first is what is an optimal diet for a "normal" lifespan?  In that
case I go with the CDC believing that obesity is a major chunk
of the problem.  If one can offset low blood sugar levels with
a drink with some sweetness, then one might be able to avoid food
cravings that may contribute to obesity.  I will grant this may
also drive up protein glycosylation but Alteon may have a solution
for protein glycosylation.  The second question is what to do if
one wants to "push-the-envelope", for example by using CR.

The reason I said "lots of ice" is that over time (as the ice melts)
the lemonade becomes more water than ice -- but retains some of the
lemonade flavor.  (Perhaps I'm a little over the edge -- but we are
just finishing up a rather hot summer by Seattle standards.)  I'm
aware of the aspartame problem -- but only to a limited extent (you
should feel free to provide links) -- my philosophy tends to be
"everything in moderation" to deal with that problem.

Wasn't able to access the original link, but if it referred to mobs of 
sunburnt, boozed and rowdy Brittish guys on holiday, stomping around in 
England soccer jerseys as if they owned the place, then it's pretty typical.

Oh, and they've a habit of chanting "Ingerland" while they stagger about, 
arms across each others shoulders for mutual support, beer drooling out the 
corners of their mouths.  Apparently the women aren't much better either.

In fact, a lot of the holiday hotspots have been clamping down on this kind 
of behaviour recently.

Still, you should see them when they're travelling for soccer matches.

Huh?  Nuclear power could achieve higher thrust...


Certainly much higher *specific* thrust.  As for
peak thrust, the good old kerosine-lox engine is
hard to beat.  I know of nothing nuclear on the 
drawing board currently that would challenge it for
vertical launch.  There are some interesting
ideas for air breathing nuclear engines, but
it suffers from the comment you made about getting
around the no-nukes crowd.

Yes, of course the higher exhaust velocity is
again specific thrust.  Actually my comment about
first and second stages was referring to the 
exhaust products of those two stages ending up
in the atmosphere.  I suppose that
a few nations might object to radioactive rocket
exhaust raining down from above.  Imagine that,
the radical greenies.  {8^D

These kinds of problems are so persistent and
apparently insoluble that I have concentrated my 
thinking not on making boosters bigger but in making 
payloads smaller, in which case our present stable of
launchers will suffice.  

Zubrin's relatively simple STS-derived booster 
looks like a hell of a good idea: use the 
existing SSMEs, solids and external tank with 
a sort of shuttle-minus-the-wings-and-wheels 
concept.  We already have the infrastructure
to make a lotta that stuff, plus the launch
facility.  We could hoist a lot of stuff with
something like that, as well as placing the
external tank in a high enough orbit to park
it for a while, then use it for something up
there.

Point well taken.  I've never claimed to be among the "right 10 people" 
so that'd be something for them to decide.

So, for instance, preemptively and without warning, nuking tokyo, los 
angeles, new york, san francisco, chicago, washington, london, paris, 
munich, berlin, beijing, (and of course, wherever GW Bush happens to be 
vacationing at the moment) etc., might be a necessity.  If the Queen of 
England survives the rubble of London, she wouldn't be able to make a 
significant move any faster that the TEAM would be.

I expect that destroying the communication infrastructure for the other 
political elite would be a primary goal.  In the US, for instance, a 
major catastrophe in Los Angeles, DC and New York would be enough to 
really whack the mainstream television/news networks.  If you could 
time it with the release of a really vicious DDOS-style virus, you'd 
have blocked information from the political elite to their followers in 
the US (just as an example) (since the combination of a congested 
network and failing smtp servers worldwide would effectively put the 
internet QUA means of military organization out of business).  That 
would leave the Military networks isolated from Civilian Networks.

If the military were simultaneously over-committed (like the current US 
military) the military would be unable to effectively respond without 
their political leadership, leaving it up to the FBI/CIA to deal with 
the threat.  You could expect half the CIA to join you if you offered 
them the right kind of incentives :) (since most of them are working 
for two side as it is...)

In (most) other countries, the communication infrastructure doesn't 
exist at the level it does here, so toppling the government isn't as 
big a deal.  In Hungary, for instance, I think most of the people 
wouldn't care if you toppled their government as long as you didn't 
replace it with something really egregious.

Okay, this has been fun, but I admit it, I'm no world-conqueror and not 
even interested in doing it.

I am interested in the future possibility of it by some 
hyper-technologically advanced coup, though, make a good novel.

Skylab was going to be reboosted when Shuttle came on line.
However, the first Shuttle flights were originally scheduled
for 1977 but delayed until 1981. Meanwhile, when the solar 
maximum hit around 1977, the ionosphere expanded, drag on
Skylab increased, and Skylab deorbited two years before the
expected date (1979).

Mir *was* refurbished -- its original design life was
something like three to five years, but the Russians kept
it running for more than double that.

Right; I see where you're coming from. I'm pretty convinced though that 
_anything_ that causes a glucose 'spike' is bad news, to be honest. The 
'stay low GI and forget about the calories' method has worked really

As promised in CRN's initial response to the recent Greenpeace report on
nanotechnology, we have prepared a detailed technical analysis and
commentary on their report. For more information, The release is available
online at http://CRNano.org/PR-Commentary.htm.

(ETC Recent activity) Developing nations 'must wise up to nanotechnology'.
Decision makers in developing countries need more information about the
potential impact of nanotechnology on their economies and livelihoods. This
was the warning given to a conference in London yesterday that celebrated
the 30th anniversary of economist E.F. Schumacher's influential book Small
is Beautiful, which argued that inappropriate technologies were failing the
developing world. Pat Mooney, head of the Canada-based Action Group on
Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC) warned that emerging field of
nanotechnology - technology and engineering at the level of atoms and
molecules - could damage developing countries' export markets and
agricultural systems...But Mark Welland, a nanotechnologist from the
University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, urged against generating 'hype'
over the possible effects of nanotechnology, both positive and negative. "We
have to be realistic and not expect too much," he said.  (SciDev 9/4/03)

Drexler speaks! - Or at least writes! In this week's issue of the magazine,
I wrote a story about some of the hype over nanotechnology-particularly
estimates of how big of a market various nanoproducts might someday have.
But it's hard to talk about nanotech without mentioning the guy who invented
the term: Eric Drexler, author of the 1986 book Engines of Creation.
(Drexler and everyone else in the field credit the founding vision behind
nanotech to a 1959 talk by Caltech physicist Richard Feynman). In
researching my article, I had a fascinating E-mail chat with Drexler. Here
is some of that exchange:...

Peres to deliver keynote Nanotech address at U.S. conference. When Shimon
Peres appears in Washington DC this week to deliver a crucial keynote
address, it will not be in any of his current roles as Labor party leader,
Nobel peace prize laureate, nor even as a highly-respected elder statesman
for Israel. Instead, Mr. Peres will be speaking in his newest role: that of

Nanomaterials. Large chemical and materials companies target small
nanotechnology firms for venture investing, collaborations, and product
innovations. Good things come in small packages. the unique properties of
nanomaterials and structures on the nanometer scale have sparked the
attention of materials developers. Incremental shifts in product performance
using these materials--for example, as fillers in plastics, as coatings on
surfaces, and as UV-protectants in cosmetics--are already occurring. The
technology holds more promise for the future, though, and is expected to
bring more disruptive changes to both products and markets. (C&E cover story

In the Laboratory for Electronic and Electromagnetic Systems at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), electrical engineer Markus Zahn
and his research team are exploring ferrofluids' potential in nanoscale
motors and biomedical devices. All the current uses of ferrofluids involve
their responding to permanent magnetic fields, fields that remain constant
and don't change over time. Zahn asked, "What happens if you put a
ferrofluid in rotating magnetic fields?" He knew that electromechanics
involved rotating machinery, and so he reasoned, "Ferrofluids could make the
world's smallest and simplest rotating machines. A simple, single magnetic
particle in a rotating magnetic field will spin." Since ferrofluid involves
countless numbers of particles, "you could induce lots of fluid motion that
could be used in nanoscale devices." -the movie on this webpage does not

ASU Researchers Develop Method for Testing Molecular Electronics.
Researchers at Arizona State University have developed a relatively
straightforward method for measuring the electrical resistance of single
molecules. The advance is a technical achievement in terms of its precision

engineering professor, and his student Bingqian Xu, said their method
overcomes three thorny issues in the electrical resistance measurements of a
single molecule. "What we have is a technique that guarantees one molecule
is attached between two electrodes every time; we can identify how many
molecules are present; and we can do thousands of measurements in a matter
of minutes," Tao said. (Nanotech Planet 9/2/03)

to the nanotubes' list: ideal photon emission. "The emission bandwidth is as
narrow as you can get at room temperature," says Lukas Novotny, professor of
optics at Rochester and co-author of the study. Such a narrow and steady
emission can make such fields as quantum cryptography and single-molecule

Wet nanoparticles alter their atoms. 'Just add water' is a phrase found on
many instant-mix food packets. Now scientists at the University of
California Berkeley, US, have found that applying the technique to certain
nanoparticles can actually change their structure. The researchers
synthesized zinc sulphide (ZnS) nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3
nm in anhydrous methanol. They discovered that adding water to the
nanoparticles at room temperature reduced distortions of the surface and
interior of the particle, producing a more crystalline arrangement of atoms.
The resulting structure was close to that of sphalerite - tetrahedrally
coordinated cubic ZnS. (nanotechweb 8/28/03)

DNA Throttle Controls Molecular Machine. A DNA sequence that acts as a
throttle to control the rate at which an enzyme moves along the DNA has been
observed by researchers at UC Davis. By controlling the activity of the
RecBCD helicase enzyme, the "Chi" sequence can affect how efficiently genes
are repaired. RecBCD unwinds the DNA double helix so that the genetic code
can be read, copied or repaired. This unwinding is an essential first step
in most processes involving DNA. The research findings, which are published
in the September 5 issue of the journal Cell, could explain how short DNA
sequences such as Chi can interact with enzymes and affect how DNA is copied
or repaired. They could also give insight into how to control the speed of
tiny nanomachines built for various purposes. (ScienceDaily 9/5/03)

Michael, don't go going all teary eyed over Zubrin's ideas.
I'm reasonably certain this is a modest extension of the Energia
and Buran configuration and that other people suggested things
along this line long before Zubrin.  Bottom line on the Suttle --
NASA should have resolved the problems of recovery of the SSMEs
on the external tank rather than sticking them on the orbiter.

Zubrin also botched the entire "development of Mars" concept --
he gets into a discussion of taking hunks of Mars putting them
into space to provide solar power satellites but doesn't realize
that with nanotech you can dismantle the entire planet (using
the same basic type of development).  He does not "get" nanotech
and does not "get" the O'Neill vision of living in space colonies.
The Mars atmosphere is essentially useless for things one would
like to use atmospheres for (providing atmospheric pressure,
shielding from UV rays, providing CO2 for plant life, etc.) so
it requires an expensive terraforming process which may include
hauling comets across a significant fraction of the solar system
to provide enough water, CO2 and atmospheric pressure -- it just
isn't worth the trouble.

Someday, if I ever have the time and energy, I'm going to see
if I can present a talk to the Mars Society starting out with
how nanotech can make significant contributions to colonization
and ending up with how, instead, it *should* be used to dismantle
the planet.  Mind you, I may not return to the ExI list after
such a presentation.  But boy, would I have fun bursting *that*
balloon.

No argument.  But for people that crave sugar -- it looks like Alteon
may have a near term solution -- vs. may other aging related problems
where we are a decade away or more.

The promotion of obesity/diabetes/insulin resistance issues are complex
because it looks like Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor (or related hormones)
are involved.  Those in turn may be related to the "rate" of operation
of the mitochondria which in turn may be related to free radical production
and damage to DNA which in turn may be related to DNA double strand breaks
and repair which corrupts the genetic code.  So in general, I would agree
that it seems like a good idea to avoid 'spikes'.  We probably are not
naturally evolved to handle them.  But in terms of what kills us I'd
place more emphasis on obesity rather than on 'spikes'.

Nada.  I just read the label on the bottle of diet coke in my fridge
and in addition to caffeine, aspartame is on the ingredient list.
Interestingly it also has a warning about containing phenylalanine.

> Most britons I talk to seem to believe this. Is it not true?

I have heard that there is a strong debate over aspartame.  I did a
limited amount of research on this a few months ago but did not find
anything that would scare me into not drinking it.

It may be yet another one of those substances where due to genetic
differences "your mileage may vary".  So its a complicated mess --
one may deny oneself the sensual pleasures of life making life
really uninteresting, causing depression that leads to suicide, OR
one may consume a natural substance (glucose) that may accelerate
protein glycosylation and may promote obesity and therefore a somewhat
premature death, OR one may consume aspartame which may not make one
age faster but may alter ones brain chemistry in undetermined ways.

So, pick your poison.

The promotion of obesity/diabetes/insulin resistance issues are complex
because it looks like Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor (or related hormones)
are involved.  Those in turn may be related to the "rate" of operation
of the mitochondria which in turn may be related to free radical production
and damage to DNA which in turn may be related to DNA double strand breaks

At some point, you really need to change your email address. It's
surprisingly painless, give it a go :-)

btw, is it possible, if you are running your own mailserver, to create
yourself a new address, kill the old one, and put your new address in the
error message that your mailserver produces when people try to use the old
address? That way, humans who send you an email to the wrong account will
get a message telling them the address you should be using, while spambots
will have no clue.

I had not heard of this idea, yet another excellent one from Zubrin.
Michael Dickey


The Case for Mars, first edition, page 62 and following.

Zubrin's Case for Mars is about the most well thought-out
treatment I have ever read on the topic.  It has nearly
every good idea, but I was slightly disappointed that he
did not mention using small people, an old favorite
notion of mine.  When I discussed it with him in person 
he was dismissive of the idea.  I never did get him
to recognize that the mass of the entire ship scales 
as the cube of the linear dimension of the crew, even if
you assume starting with a shuttle C or shuttle Z, or an
Ares.  spike

Zubrin also botched the entire "development of Mars" concept ...He does
not "get" nanotech and does not "get" the O'Neill vision of living in
space colonies...


Agreed, however he makes an assumption right up front
in his Case for Mars to assume *only* current (1996)
proven technology.  Nanotech isn't there yet.  

I mentioned nanotech to him at a conference of Doctors 
for Disaster Preparedness.  He must have been shocked at 
that one, for it was perhaps the only conference where he 
spoke and was not mobbed by admirers.  He was just in the
wrong place: DDP is an association of physicians who
ponder how to survive and help others in the event of
a nuclear war.  I do not know why Zubrin was speaking
at that, but I took advantage of the opportunity.  I
got his undivided attention for about half an hour.

In any case, he isn't a nanotech believer.



 The Mars atmosphere is essentially useless for things one would like to
use atmospheres for (providing atmospheric pressure, shielding from UV
rays, providing CO2 for plant life, etc.)...

Robert


Mars' atmosphere is good for *some* of the things
we need atmospheres for.  Granted it doesn't provide
pressure or shielding, only cursed dust storms.  However
it is a carbon source, and might provide *some* water,
two things that are in way short supply on the moon.

But... but... Robert, if you can pull a perfectly nice and inoffensive
planet apart cheaply with nano, surely you can use the same technology to
haul in the comets etc and terraform it. That might seem a shocking waste
of resources to you, but it isn't an *expensive* one, by hypothesis.

In terms of preferences in allocation of time, I'd rather spend it
improving the SpamBouncer Filtering files rather than wrestling with
sendmail configuration files simply bouncing stuff to the old email
address (neither of these processes I am overly familiar with and so
both have relatively high learning curves).  That might benefit everyone
who uses Spambouncer -- though I suspect its long term effectiveness may
be limited and I'll have to finish implementing a Bayesian solution.

One also has the problem of having to change the email addresses for
multiple mailing lists that one may have to do some research on to see
how many one is a member of.

But I would agree that the this might be a reasonable course of action.
Alternatively one could get a "free" email account (Hotmail, etc.) and
let the ISP deal with much of the problem.

But if you ever run across an example of how to fix sendmail to do what
you are discussing please send it to me.

Say Alex: Best advice! Please share your Glycemic Index URLs. [Why is 
the GI so scarce?] Maintaining [flat lining?] serum glucose & insulin 
tops my life-preservation list. Insulin spiking is the number one, 
stealth cardio-vascular killer. So serum glucose fluctuations are of 
more concern than total daily carb consumption.

L-glutamine cuts glucose-crash cravings - cravings which inevitably 
lead to more spikes and crashes. Other cravings may indicate specific 
nutrient deficiencies.

Doesn't aspartame trigger insulin spiking? Perhaps that is the reason 
it's addictive.

Re: not smoking: 18 years after 'Aversion therapy & hypnosis,' a mere 
hint of odor still induces nausea. So choosing not to smoke was also a 
lifestyle change. [thankfully, I relocated to an area where smoking was 
a social disease.]

Fat and fiber slow carbs. But what fat? Olive oil on popcorn? What do 
Extropians consume? What are your ten top foods, ten you avoid, and ten 
temptations?

I once joined the Mars society, and never renewed my membership. This is
probably one of the most closed minded groups of intelligent people you will
ever meet. These people care about one thing...going to Mars as soon as
possible. They aren't concerned with any major achievements and I don't
doubt that they would lead us into another Moon scenario where we go, and
never return.
They do not "get" nanotech, nor do they "get" the human culture or
capitalism. They don't understand how their efforts affect the future of
humanity and look after their own pet project rather than the greater good
of the human race.
Personally, I would like to see us forget about Mars for a while and focus
on settlement of the moon as a launch platform to the rest of the solar
system. What could nano do to turn moon dust into usable energy? I would
also like to see us man a mission to a NEO and attempt to change it's
course. This way we can begin to understand how to defend ourselves against
these planet killers. It would really be a bad thing to be on the verge of
immortality when a big rock smacks us hard enough to either kill us, or set
us back about 2000 years.

So anyways, good luck with your speech. I hope you can return in one piece!

Can anyone provide a reference for the estimated cost of 
NASA's Mars Reference Mission? The report itself lacks a 
numeric cost estimate, and it gives a broken link for 
further supplements.

I've just finishing my book "1-on-One Fitness" which I co-authored with 
commercial model Leigh Christian.  It hasn't gone to press yet, but you can 
get a copy now.

The focus of the book is a 6-week workout program that focuses on 
cardiorespiratory, muscle strength, and nutrition.  (Both Leigh and I are 
certified Personal Trainers and also certified in Nutrition.)

The sections on Nutrition focus on what foods to eat for your specific goal 
(lose weight, gain weight, sculpt or cut muscle, etc.)  It also has a FAQ 
on nutrition and a section on Myths about diet.

Email me privately if you are interested.

I am right at my "ideal" body weight, but I expect to put on a few pounds
while I adjust to being a non-smoker. I'm also only 5'3" so I am a good
candidate for a Mars mission :-)
Until recently I had been of the opinion that cancer cause smoking, not the
other way around. I figured that a few mutated DNA sequences were
responsible for cancer, and addiction. (Have you ever met an alcoholic
non-smoker?)
Anyways, I was living based on a hypothesis that I had created without
adequate knowledge that could justify smoking. Just like any other junky.
Now I know it was the nicotine talking.

With my diet, I love pizza, McDonald's, and any other fast-food. I rarely
eat "normal" meals. I used to eat 3 peanut butter sandwiches per day. Yet my
body weight has never been below or above average. I have maintained the
same 135-140 pounds for the ;ast 15 years. I am inexcusably healthy. I am
sick no more than pnce per year and I fight it off quickly. I have a few
allergies, but not many. Everyone in my family smokes. My great-grandmother
died at 96 a few years ago. My grandparents are all deceased, but 2 died
from alcoholism, one an accident, one complications from radiation exposure
in WW2 in Nagasaki.

But i don;t want to take the chances any further than I need to. Thanks for
your help!

Jay,

Re:
> Can anyone provide a reference for the estimated cost of
> NASA's Mars Reference Mission?

It isn't clear to me what report you are referencing (in the
future it might be nice to post a URL)...

But Zubrin, in Chapter 3 on pgs 46/47 of "The Case for Mars"
documents the "90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the Moon and
Mars", otherwise known as "The 90-Day Report".

He says, "The 90-Day Report did not include a published cost
estimate; however cost estimates for the program were generated
that were eventually leaked to the press.  The bottom line:
$450 Billion."

How accurate this is, I don't know.  You might want to check
the references.  The numbers I've seen thrown around for something
more simple tend to be in the range of $50-$100 Billion.

But it seems to me that if a Mars robotic explorer mission costs
~$500 million that one could fund a heck of a lot of AI research
for the difference between 10 Robotic/AI missions to Mars ($5B)
and the cost of sending a few humans there.  We just simply weren't
designed for space -- so one either needs redesigned humans
(comfortable in zero G, radiation tolerant, able to withstand
long periods of colder temperatures for reduced metabolic
requirements, perhaps smaller as Spike has argued) -- or one
needs to forget the idea of Mars colonization/terraforming
entirely.  Instead go with migrating O'Neill colonies that
can swing by Earth and pick up their passengers.

Robert

As impressive as these and other similar "heavy lifters" are we need to
get away from the idea that the best way to get out of the gravity well
is via any form of self contained thrust/reaction propulsion. It simply
makes no sense to use propellent that you have to lift as a mechanism of
getting to space.
=20
Some alternatives...
=20
1) ground based laser propulsion - "lightcraft" - this has been working
in proto-type stage for years...all we really need is higher powered
lasers (and the weapons boys are working on those for their own ends...)
see
http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/laser_propulsion_0007
05.html for some background
=20
2) beanstalk! - this has been limited before now by the need for a
strong material from which to fabricate the supporting structure.
Various forms of nano-tubes are being developed and all thats really
holding this back at this point is the ability to construct longer
strands of the tough material cheaply. Lots of research on lots of
fronts that will lead quickly to addressing this need. See
http://www.isr.us/SEHome.asp for background and details.
=20
3) ?
=20
The $$ and effort that would be spent revamping the Saturn V lifters, or
developing the "next generation" shuttle could be spent with a much
higher return in developing these or other similar projects. Give up on
the idea of massive rockets and consider the alternatives...lets move
toward a real reusable approach ;-)

(estimates here of ~$40/lb (or less) for lift to orbit and high volume
transports not limited "launches")

It does make more sense if the shuttle / cargo is made of nanostuff and
therefore lighter. The cost of LH2 LO2 is neglectible compared to the
other costs. Nano can eliminate a great deal of them even though
lauches would still be noisy. That way all the past experineces in
lauch systems can be re-used.

I think decentralized solutions work better. Consider that such
elevators are primary targets for terrorists. And we didn't create
structures of that size yet. Lessons would need to be learned we could
do without.

I used to have to delete 50 spams a day (that many got by Mozilla's
filter), but then I started using Mac OS X, which comes with Mail.app.
Mail.app filters all but 2 or 3 spams a day, with no false positives
yet, and I get about 12000 spam emails a month.  This has convinced
me that the main problem is improving filters for other people's
mail clients, since filters essentially make the problem go away for
me.

Yes, it's possible, but it would be trivial to make the spambots
notice and harvest the new address, so it may not be worth it.

Apropos some of our earlier discussions, here is a good essay by David 
Brin. Replace "libertarian" with "transhumanist" and you get a powerful 
exhortation:

http://www.techcentralstation.com/102802A.html

(long version at http://www.davidbrin.com/libertarianarticle1.html)

Here's a thought that might help freedom-loving men and women win 
elective office and gain influence over society's future course: Perhaps 
our fellow citizens aren't fools after all!

Brin write:

Actually, I agree with Brin in many respects. I think that people of certain 
cultures, operating within their cultures, do operate wisely and rationally--
to a certain degree (see, for example, religion, as an area where they do not 
operate rationally, to a great extent).

But I do not think people in all cultures operate wisely and rationally.  
Cultures endorse behavior, and some cultures are not very rational.  
Therfore, some cultures do not operate very well at all. For example, I do 
not think there are any rational cultures in Africa, as far as I can tell.

So put a NOSPAM in the address, or space it with underscores or something.
Or don't worry; if most people don't do it, the spam bots wont worry about
it. It's not worth the effort to code up.

Actually, the path less travelled is littered with little benefits like
that.

I don't use sendmail, but if I see something I'll let you know. Someone else
here will know, anyway.

I only advocate changing email addresses because I've done it a couple of
times, and it was surprisingly painless. It wasn't my choice; I had a
succession of ISPs go under. OTOH, it was sufficiently annoying eventually
that I've now got an email address from someone other than my ISP.

No -- it is very clear and well documented -- certain enzymes, primarily
found in the liver transform molecules found in smoke into cancer causing
(carcinogenic) molecules -- but whether one has those genetic (enzyme)
variants cannot be determined (easily) currently.  This explains why some
people smoke and get cancer and other people smoke and don't get cancer.

This is clear: Some people are susceptable to addiction (largely genetics).
Some of those people smoke.  A subset of those people get cancer and
have a diminished lifespan.

> (Have you ever met an alcoholic non-smoker?)

I know of individuals, who once did smoke, who would probably fall into
this category -- i.e. they don't smoke but can be considered alcoholics.

> Now I know it was the nicotine talking.

And as I pointed out -- I don't think it is the nicotine that is particularly
bad -- it is all the other stuff that is in the smoke.

Peanut butter sandwiches are probably not particularly bad.  You probably
have a fast metabolism that explains being able to maintain the weight level.

> My great-grandmother died at 96 a few years ago.

Suggests that (at least from one source) that one may not have the genes
that lead one from smoking to cancer -- but that probably only involves
about 12% of your risk factors (one has to take all of the other relatives
into account).

Actually this is a poor assumption.  People are "rational and wise" within
their survival framework -- there is nothing to guarantee that that framework
is "rational and wise".  I'll cite the example of Mohammed Ali -- it was
"rational and wise" for him to engage in boxing from the prespective that
he would win the matches be awarded prizes, fame and fortune.  However, it
was *not* "rational and wise" from the framework that boxing tends to
cause brain damage and may lead to significant negative consequences
(e.g. Parkinson's like symptoms) later in life.  And I don't know if
he had sufficient information to make an "informed" decision until
he became the classic example for why boxing is self-destructive.

So very often people may go after the short term benefits and ignore
the long term consequences (e.g. "live for today for tomorrow you may
be dead).

So one requires a better definition of "rational and wise" that takes
into account the discounted value of present life vs. future life.
Hell, if an asteroid is going to strike the Earth next week and wipe
out a large part of humanity, why shouldn't I break into a store and
steal a plasma HDTV?  I at least get to enjoy it for a week.  No
significant consequences -- no reason to be "rational and wise".
So it comes down to an ability to predict consequences (which I
believe is a very ill-defined art.)

Thanks everyone for all the feedback. I'm going through it all now and
hopefully I can form it all into a good overall plan. The most difficult
thing I am dealing with is that after 4 days of being a non-smoker, I kind
of feel mentally incapacitated. I can't type worth a darn and I have to
struggle to make a coherent sentence! I honestly feel drugged!
During the next few weeks, I apologize if my thoughts seem a bit random or
my logic a bit impaired.
Again, thanks for the help!
Kevin

Some people just have this belief that space should
be for everyone, which rules out relying on small
crews exclusively unless and until everyone can be
small enough (for instance, via telepresence, since
the robot does not scale with the size of the user).
Yes, the physics would make it more convenient for
small crews only.  Slavery used to be more convenient
for the slave owners.  And there are those who will
morally equate the two concepts.

On Behalf Of Robert J. Bradbury
... The numbers I've seen thrown around for something more simple tend
to be in the range of $50-$100 Billion...We just simply weren't designed
for space -- so one either needs redesigned humans (comfortable in zero
G, radiation tolerant, able to withstand long periods of colder
temperatures for reduced metabolic requirements, perhaps smaller as
Spike has argued) -- or one needs to forget the idea of Mars
colonization/terraforming entirely.  Instead go with migrating O'Neill
colonies that can swing by Earth and pick up their passengers.  Robert


The O'Neill colonies suffer from a lot of the
same limitations as the Mars missions.  I have
spent most of my thinking time on the waaaaay
cheap and small end of the mission spectrum, 
designing missions that everyone could afford
and no one would actually want to do.  

There are underlying assumptions in every single
mission design I have ever seen, ones that are
so obvious they are not even stated, such as
the desire to return to Earth after spending
some time on Mars.  I have imagined one-way trips
like the old time pioneers leaving home in a
wagon across the great plains, with no intentions
of ever returning.  Throw away the return-trip
hardware and assume only two crew members:
the cost could be brought down to perhaps 5 billion.
Still a ton of dough, but less than a Gatesian fortune.

Some people just have this belief that space should
be for everyone...


In my scenario, it *is* for everyone who is born
at the destination.  The only ones that need to
be really small are those very few who actually
cross the great gulf.

for the slave owners.  And there are those who will

Well, Im not sure I follow your reasoning with
that analogy, but I can assure you Adrian,
we will not be able to take very many of the 
humans currently on this planet to Mars.  spike

Oh ye of little faith.  ^_-

(Now, whether most such humans would want to go if
given the choice is another matter, and of course I'm
not talking about taking the unwilling.  But "will be
able to" refers to future physical, including
technological, capability.)

Suppose that a bowl has 5 red chips and 3 white chips.  We sample chips 
from the bowl using the following procedure:  On each round we draw a 
random chip, replace it, and then add another chip of the same color to 
the bowl.  For example, if on the first round we happen to draw a red 
chip, there would then be 6 red chips and 3 white chips to draw from on 
the second round.

Given that a white chip was drawn on the fourth round, what is the 
probability that a white chip was drawn on the second round?

(This problem is extra bonus evil because it's so easy if you know the rules.)

So if I understood Randy right, some entire cultures should be managed 
by other cultures "for their own good" since they are not rational and 
wise, while Robert thinks people are not rational and wise since some 
people choose short-term goals. 

Personally I think you are falling into exactly the trap Brin was
warning against. These views are not compatible with the libertarian
idea that people can be trusted and allowed to run their own lives. The
fact that some are not rational or long-term is not an indictment of
everybody else. And policies based on the "people are irrational and 
stupid" meme complex tend to be centralist, misanthropic and coercive.

In Randy's case, the response is likely to have the rational cultures
manage the irrational ones. The only problem is of course how to tell
which ones are rational. The US government right now certainly thinks it
is rational, and right now cheerfully tries to implement it in the
"irrational" middle east. Meanshwile representatives of European culture
thinks they are even more rational and actually should manage the
irrational and dangerous US if they only had the power (and who knows
that the Chinese are thinking). Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Just 
imagine a situation where the power ranking was different.

But I think Robert's case is more important (foreign policy isn't
exactly the area where Brin's analysis is relevant) since it directly
impringes on our transhumanist goals. 

Isn't transhumanism a short-term (and hence irrational) strategy,
compared to the promise of eternal life given by our Lord and Saviour
Christ? That argument might not convince anybody on this list, but it
makes a lot of sense to a lot of people. So maybe for our own good we
should be sent to church. The rationalist response is of course to try
to demonstrate the irrationality of religious beliefs, which seldom has
any larger effect than polarizing the issue since religion often runs on
another epistemology than we do. It becomes a kind of shouting match,
and whoever wins and gets to decide who is and isn't irrational is
likely going to oppress the other. Which is exactly the situation
libertarianism was out to avoid by trying to set up frameworks of mutual
tolerance and ways of trading even when people disagree. 

Today boxers know that boxing is unhealthy, and they still do it. Many 
athletes are apparently willing to sacrifice their lives in order to 
excel. Are they irrational (and hence in need of being managed for their 
own good)? I don't think so. I think they have a very different value 
system from us, one that evaluates fame and achievement enormously 
higher than long-term health, and then act accordingly. That might 
very well be the best life to live for them. There exist a lot of very 
strange life projects, and if we or anybody else would start dividing 
them into apporved "rational and wise" lives and disapproved 
"irrational" lives, we end up with the same problems as with the 
religion example above. In the end it all becomes an issue of power 
rather than human excellence. Transhumanism is not likely to be on the 
powerful side, and even if it was, how would we handle the vast 
differences in opinion on the most rational approach to posthumanity 
within our own group?

Brin's point is important: it does not matter that we see a lot of 
people doing things we think are stupid. They have actually been doing 
great! By starting from the *positive* side of humans and their 
institution and looking at how it can be improved, you get a very 
constructive agenda that actually can entice people to join. If you 
instead look mainly at the negative side you will become a centralist 
and lose the cooperation with people.

Actually, original "liberalism" is built on the assumption that you can so 
limit the legalized power of others over yourself as to not need to worry 
overly much about how rational or wise others are.

Classical liberalism is not concerned with "cultures" or any other collective.  
It is concerned with individuals and keeping them free to follow their own 
designs.

That is certainly an "interesting" extrapolation of what I actually
said. What I actually said was:


"But I do not think people in all cultures operate wisely and
rationally.  
Cultures endorse behavior, and some cultures are not very rational.  
Therfore, some cultures do not operate very well at all. For example,
I do 
not think there are any rational cultures in Africa, as far as I can
tell."

If that worked, you could have done it for the first address
in the first place, and not bothered changing it.  But it
doesn't seem to work.  Spam harvesters are pretty smart
programs, I think.

However, the real reason I'm reluctant to do stuff like this
is that my usual preference is not to spend more time to raise
a barrier than it would take someone else to lower it.  If I
do something to "get ahead", and someone else counters it, so
that we're even again, we've both wasted that much time on
useless competition, as opposed to some other kind of
competition which might produce something valuable. :)

Actually, as I mentioned in the part you snipped, I no longer have
a spam problem.  It's solved, as far as I'm concerned, and if
everyone implements similar solutions, it will be mostly solved
for everyone.  The only way for the spammers to get around it,
as far as I can see, would be to make the spam something I really
want to see.

Yes, I did assume that you thought "irrational" cultures should be
managed for their own benefit. My apologies if you really meant that
they should be allowed to remain irrational (modulo the usual
interactions and mutual non-aggression).

Based on my possibly erroneous reading of your post. I was seeing it
as a good example of the mindset Brin criticizes as incompatible
with a libertarian push for increased human freedom, that mainly
focus on the irrationality on other people or groups.

Fine. Then we have absolutely no quarrel. I certainly don't want to
tell anybody how they must run their culture. Of course, I might go
beyond non-intervention in that I will support movements, memes,
people or institutions I like or think will help them (like Grameen
International Bank, golden rice or open science publishing) in order
to play a bit of win-win game theory. But that is Darwin too.

There are some (not insignificant number, I think) of sys
admins that hate this idea, because it generates more garbage
on the Net. I made the goof a few years ago of putting
DELETETHIS in the middle of my German email address, as I
thought it was polite way to tell people what to remove of my
email address in order to reply to me when I wrote on Usenet
groups. Unfortunately there is really a company with the
domain of 'deletethis.de', and they were getting the spam that
was originally directed at me. I should have checked about
that, first, and I didn't.

Someone alerted me to the Germany sysadmin usenet group
discussing me, and one person was asking the group if his
company should fine me for manufacturing my email that way.
When I wrote them and said it was a simple mistake on my part;
I had a large web site with a lot of educational materials
that was getting harvested no matter what I did, they said
that creating an email address such as 'nospam...' was
*anti-social*  and I was making garbage on the Net.

After that, I rarely write on Usenet now. I haven't decided
yet if I should remove my domain, however, since my eight year
domain is a tentacle into a space that is part of me too. It
would feel too strange to me, to not have it.

The 'net has been a big disappointment for me, in general though.

Well yes but is my response, I'm closer to Anders and Brin on this. The
above is a true, succinct statement of the political essense of classical
liberalism but I think that political argument assumes the rationality of
the majority. If the majority are not rational then the political project of
limiting the legalised power of others over oneself would not be
practicable. The sensible strategy would be to pursue power so as to protect
yourself. I think one of the two fundamental questions that divide people in
modern times is "Can you trust people to decide things for themselves?"
Classical liberals would say yes because people are broadly rational, learn
from mistakes, have access to knowledge that others do not (such as knowing
what they most value) while others would either say no you can't trust
people because they are ignorant/emotional/culture bound/gene driven or
whatever or that there is some revealed good way of living that should trump
people's subjective choices. The hidden premiss of the latter argument is
that there is an elite (the expert professionals in Brin's analysis) who
know better than the rest of us what's good for us. I'm reminded of what
Gladstone said when asked to define liberalism "Trust the people". (The full
version was "Liberalism is trust in the people tempered by prudence, Toryism
is mistrust of the people tempered by fear")

Couldn't agree more. There's a lot of sloppy thinking going on about
'cultures' these days, often with the unspoken assumption that culture is
destiny.

What if it falls?=20

The majority, the long end out in space, gains enough speed that it
burns up in the atmosphere, with the lower portion falling into the sea.
It will not fall on top of anyone.=20
=20
Additional breakage theories seem to generally indiate that the
remaining long portion will either be flung free via the earths
rotational momentem or be destroyed on re-entry. I dont think there is
anything to fear here about this concern although more detailed studies
should be part of any such project (perhaps even including a sacrificial
test stalk that is intentionally "brought down" while not yet fully
formed for some "real world" analysis)
=20
Although the initial stalk could be a terror target there are 3 major
things which will operate against this:
1) the location will be somewhere in equatorial waters in a zone which
could be heavily patrolled and controlled. It would take signifigant
resources to penetrate that.
2) the obvious benefits of the structure and the "global" usage it would
provide would tend to limit focus by "special interest" groups as they
would have no specific "owner" to hate=20
3) After construction of the initial stalk the plan is for additional
stalks (at different locations) to be quickly built. Even if one was
taken out there would be other stalks present and more could be quickly
built.=20

Check out the site more throughly and have a look at the concepts and
FAQ's (also see specifically
http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/contents.html for some in-depth
analysis performed for NASA) I think you'll find many of your concerns
answered.

Here's a thought that might help freedom-loving men and women win 
elective office and gain influence over society's future course: Perhaps

our fellow citizens aren't fools after all! 


As with Transparent Society, I agree in principle with
Brin, but there are some very important details that have
not been worked out.  We should leave other societies to
their own ways, however different levels of governments
disagree.  Take for instance the woman threatened with
execution for copulation.  She most likely opposes the
sentence, as does her family, but the village might
support it, whereas the province opposes but the
nation supports.  Which level of government shall
we support or oppose?  It is an oversimplification
to just say let other nations do their thing.  spike

But Europeans share more of your genes, Anders.  Going with the whole concept 
of nepotism as gene-survival strategy, why would you want to help African 
cultures, instead of helping your own European cousins? 

Or are you unconsciously striking an altruistic pose, hoping to better pass 
on your own genes by doing so?

It could be a bad idea for other reasons too (I didn't read this
thread, but GEO caught my eye)

Satellites break up in GEO regularly. These large pieces are
tracked and don't pose threats in general because their
filling factor in space is low. However drag is not a force
that can bring these objects down, so the GEO population is
only growing in time.

In addition, the smaller (<1cm) GEO debris population is not
known well because in-situ dust/debris detectors in GEO are
few/rare, remote sensing cannot detect the small particles,
and we don't have enough opportunities to bring back solar
panels and other surfaces of satellites to examine their
hypervelocity impact record.

People (including me) are using what we can to learn about the
debris/dust population in GEO, but there's not enough
data. What we've learned so far are rough flux numbers and it
appears that debris and natural micrometeoroid number
densities are about the same. The charges and velocities and
masses of the tiny particles in GEO are pretty uncertain
though. The GORID detector, twin of Ulysses' dust detector,
which piggybacked on a Russian telecommunications satellite
for 6 years, is likely our best data set for a while (it was
turned off one year ago). The data is being analyzed in detail
now.

I hope also those people that are looking at GEO for space
elevators are up to speed on their Earth's magnetosphere
physics.

GEO tends to skim the inner boundary of the plasma sheet, and
the radiation belts and ring current are located near GEO, as
well.  During solar quiet times, the bodies orbiting at this
location are typically at dipolar-like field lines. During
large magnetic storms, the bodies orbiting at GEO are within
stretched field lines. It can be a very energetic place.

Randy! Re-read the last two sentences he wrote. He answered your question
before you even asked him.


But Europeans share more of your genes, Anders.  Going with the whole concept 
of nepotism as gene-survival strategy, why would you want to help African     
cultures, instead of helping your own European cousins?                       

Or are you unconsciously striking an altruistic pose, hoping to better pass   
on your own genes by doing so?                                                


Using the word 'genes' together with a posessive pronoun is so 20th century,
Randy. The technology is already pretty much there (albeit still in its
infancy) for us to insert and deactivate genes as we choose. Goodbye Darwinian
evolution, hello Lamarckian evolution. Goodbye genetic determinism, hello
memetic determininsm.

Don't know about other people, but I for one would like for African genes and
memes to be alive and well alongside my own Slavic ones, in the very likely
case that they have something useful I'll need to borrow at some point.

I have no loyalty to my genes, only to my memes. I do not plan to
reproduce genetically but rather memetically. By spreading my memes I am
in a sense uploading myself into mankind (although I prefer to have one
or more continous central consciousness threads active too). If I can
get millions to hold similar beliefs and values as I hold, then I have
succeeded far better than I could ever hope for genetically. 

While our genetic machinery might bias us in many ways, we are also able
to hijack the biases cognitively. We are only controlled if we allow 
ourselves to be. 

There is also the reciprocal benefit thing. I believe I will be better 
off if a lot of people like me, are peaceful and prosperous and have 
reasons to trade neat things and services with me. I also think I will 
benefit by having a large pool of diversity accesible - new ideas, new 
solutions, alternative strategies and plenty of surprises. Hence there 
is no reason to strive for monoculture but rather diverse cultures with 
certain biases. And I fully accept that the situation is symmetric with 
other people: there is room for overlaying our memetic radiations.

Sure, I'm very egocentric. It is just that I try to enlarge my ego to 
encompass all things.

Sure, but that does not change the basic idea. Libertarian theory says 
one should be peaceful and not initiate coercion, but it is still OK to 
defend oneself. Furthermore, systems of delegated defensive coercion 
(neighbourhood associations, PPL firms or police forces) are acceptable 
- within certain limits. Here things become applied and complex, and one 
can spend forever analysing the best approach, various more or less 
likely what-ifs and how to implement it - it has already been done on 
this list and elsewhere. Other extensions and refinements of the theory 
apply to cases of lack of information, deranged people, prepersons and 
so on. Again a lot of complicated judgements but a fairly clear core 
principle that now interacts with various other principles.

How OK it is to intervene coercively to save another person from
coercion or violence is in this complex area, but my understanding
(interpretation?) of the (a?) libertarian position would be that it is
usually OK, although it does not have to be a moral obligation. This is
based on the natural rights perspective. In order to save a human from
an unjust violation of her right to live it is OK to coerce her
violators (but avoid unnecessary violence; the case for whether they may
be killed in the pursuit of human rights is very iffy). This is of
course based on the universalist view that a certain hierarchy of rights
really do apply to all people no matter who, when or where they are and 
that even socially agreed on laws about sex can not void the right to 
life. 

We should let others do their thing, but there are things that merit 
intervention. But one should not see intervention as the default case, 
but rather as a very extreme special case. We often go on far too much 
about all the injustices and problems of the world to look at the vast 
fields of positive results that we already have and how to extend them 
more efficiently.

The 'certain biases' probably being something like rationality and 
non-coercion, am I right?

But you know, I don't even mind individuals that don't share these 
biases in our memepool... as long as they're a fringe rather than the 
dominant force. In practical terms, if I could push a button that would 
memetically-engineer all the religious fundamentalists, Nazis, 
eco-luddites, and Communists into good little Extropians, I wouldn't do 
it. 90% of them into Extropians? Then yes, I'd be tempted to push the 
button, that's true. But I do not wish outright memetic extinction on 
anybody, even those who are literally my worst memetic adversaries.

I'd wondered if something like this might be the case,
but I knew not how to approach the question.

Now, if only one could bring a large enough magnetic
trap to bear, close enough to a solar flare, to skim
off the antimatter.  Or perhaps one would have to go
inside the flare, using extremely high powered and
limited duration (just long enough to get in, get the
antimatter, and get out) cooling.

You don't have to *live* there, though, right? The beanstalk stretches even
further out than the distance from surface to GEO. But maybe it would put
too much tension on the string to have a big station on the far end, say?

No, it wouldn't matter if there was a station hanging
somewhere on the far side of GEO or just a cable stretching
way out there for counterbalance.  The maximum tension
in the cable is the same either way, and occurs right
at GEO.  Damien I sent you a spreadsheet showing this
a couple years ago.  If you want it, I can search around
in my files.

I just learned I won the lottery, and I didn't
even buy a ticket.  How is THAT for lucky?  The
email is from someone in "Amterdam Netherlands"
with a promotional program sponsored by "Bill
Gate" who I am told is "President of the World
Largest Software."  Good thing I am over age 
18, for otherwise I would be "AUTHOMATICALLY 
DISQUALIFIED."

Question please: what long term effect will it
have on the world to have children trained in
skepticism from a very early age, instead of
later in life, when most of us became hardened
doubters?  I see this as a good thing, to have
tons of email bombarding impressionable young
minds, training them that most of what they
hear is propaganda, advertising or just plain
old bullshit.

I'd suggest that such an approach would kill much of the fun.  You buy
your ticket on the elevator knowing that 50% of the time the elevator
accelerates halfway to the end of the beanstalk and then decelerates
through the other half.  But the other 50% of the time the elevator
turns the deceleration motors into acceleration motors and when you
hit the end -- well LEO and GEO are things you don't have to think
much about anymore.

Heads you win.  Tails you become a god (at least if the ETs/SIs are around
to pick you up).

There has got to be a novel where one day the aliens all decide to
descend on Roswell and explain how it was all a big hoax.

I think there are better ways of teaching scepticism
and critical thinking to children than adding noise/spam
to message on the internet.

It an interesting idea though. ie. That "ideal" parenting
may not prepare children best for life in the real world.

Cool essay, especially the longer one.  Anticipation vs. resiliency (a point
he's made before) (or anticipation *and* resiliency), the Platonism of Ayn
Rand's "Objectivism" (Is it falsifiable?)  And the righteousness-addiction and
individualism-training, although those are way old hat for me by now.

"The modern market is a magnificent hand-crafted, opportunity-generating

Complexity of air traffic control as a sign of freedom -- you have to learn
when to report in, vs. Europeans reporting in all the time.  But that means
Americans don't have to report in lots of the time.  (Just when they want to
land.)

Really? All I got was my penis enlarged. What am I supposed to do with 
yet ANOTHER ten inches? Make $25,000 working from home, I guess. Or talk 
to the thousands of beautiful women who are waiting to meet me. Not 
sure... I guess I need to watch incoming mail for clarification. Right 
after I get done opening the attachments from several dozen people I 
never met referring to meetings I never had with them.

Ah! So its guys with life styles like *yours* that are getting

Why would you like to reduce incentives to invest by individuals of limited

### Yes. By increasing the flow of capital to the mud huts.

(This is not meant as a snub - I actually mean exactly what I wrote. The
easier it is to invest, the more competition there is for workers, and the
better wages ensue)

If you and a bunch of other volunteers choose to intervene then that is your 
business.  Just don't expect the country to bail you out or coerce others to 
support your adventure against their will.

It hampers clarity to cast the intervention in terms of coercion.  You are 
responding to an initiation of force against someone by generously taking up 
their defense against same.   Using force to counteract the initiation of 
force is justified.  However much violence as is needed to stop/counter the 
original initiation of force is ok if it is as limited as possible.   Of 
course, it is another question entirely whether one's evaluation of the 
merits of a particular possible intervention is rational or not.

### Yes, georgism has a lot to offer. Still, I have the feeling it doesn't
hit the mark. Consider e.g. rental property. In many situations, such
property is bought and sold relatively frequently, depending on the
availability of other investments. The rent collected by the owner is quite
limited, usually not appreciably greater than the gains from the stock
market, in most cases lower. Some long-term owners of real estate which
appreciated in value due to societal change may collect high rents, in
relation to the initial investment, but then such long-term investments are
risky, there were uncounted numbers of people who bought land which didn't
appreciate as much, and there is also the missed opportunity cost - one
could have invested in Berkshire-Hathaway instead  of land in Alaska. In
fact, since true productivity comes from manufacturing and services, most
importantly production of scientific discoveries, investors in these
activities gained most, while investors in land are like collectors of
moonlight - they get the second-hand effects of real enrichment.

I think that George correctly identified rent-seeking as one of the
activities which can be taxed with the least damage to the economy, but
rent-seeking should be identified not so much with land-ownership per se, as
with monopoly or oligopoly control of limited resources, including, but not
limited to, land. Vast landholdings in some countries, especially where
agriculture is the pillar of the economy, indeed might limit growth, but the
same could be said, perhaps to a lesser degree, about some industrial
concentrations of power, such as the Societe Generale of Belgium, and other
industrial organizations with close ties to state power.

It makes more sense, IMO, to tax (assuming taxation is desirable in the
first place) entities according to size, perhaps adjusted for the percentage
of market penetration in a sliding window of human mobility matrix (sorry
for the cryptic language in invented here, expl. follows). Human mobility
matrix would be a description of the ability of humans to change the
entities they interact with in a particular aspect of their life. Certain
interactions are highly constrained by location, like buying of sewage
removal services through the use of a sewer system. Competition in this
system is difficult to implement incrementally, and every service provider
might require an investment equal to the investments of the most successful
competitor. Other interactions, such as buying of groceries or dictation
transcription services, are less constrained by location, due to the ease of
transport of the goods and services, as well as the ability to have
competitors with lower total investment (lower barriers to entry). A window
of the mobility matrix covers a number of consumers (e.g. 5 000), multiplied
by the number of providers of a service. A small number of suppliers reduces
the number of the consumers in the window. If a supplier covers more than a
window of adjacent customers of constant size (the actual size would need to
be optimized in simulations and in practical experiments), a tax would be
assessed, depending on the percentage of customers the supplier has in the
window. So a sewer company would be taxed if it had more than 5 000
customers in an area where it is an exclusive provider, or 10 000 customers
if it has one competitor. There would be an incentive to either keep the
company small, or to build parallel sewage systems, so users could easily
switch, reaping both the benefits of competition directly, and the increased
reliability of double systems. Same reasoning applies to cable, land-line
telephone, etc. On the other hand, providing a radio station service to a
million people would still escape taxes - since there are dozens of
competitors supplying similar services. Land ownership would be taxed based
on a sliding window counting tenants. An additional level of adjustment
could be a factor of the total economic impact of the supplier/landlord in a
window - the percentage of total economic activity flowing through the
supplier (this would need more details than I have the time to describe
here).

Please note that at no point do I suggest state provision of services, or
regulation of business practices, with the exception of size, which I treat
as a proxy measure of the ability to constrain individual choices of
consumers. The aim of the program is to increase economic growth by limiting
limits on competition, and provide funds for certain limited,
non-redistributive state services. Considerations of justice, fairness,
natural law and common decency do not apply.

How abhorrent is this tax scheme?

(diverging into another subject here)

This is an interesting issue. Being very much into non-coercion
I don't consider either button acceptable at all; even changing 
the mind of one opponent this way would be wrong - while I agree 
that conserving memetic diversity is good, the right to one's mind 
is even more important (and in this case both are aligned). But at 
the same time I have no problems with the idea of debating and 
perhaps convincing a lot of opponents. So what makes these cases 
different? Is it just the "unnatural means" of the button?

I think the key here is that we to a first approximation are the
rulers of our minds. We change our opinions based on the full
contents of our minds and not just the latest input, making it to a
large extent a voluntary action. If I refuse to accept a logical or
convincing argument (perhaps grasping at semantic or religious
straws or whatever) it is still my decision. Even when I am 
convinced gradually, without any real conscious awareness, that 
change is to a great extent based on the rest of my cognitive 
structure. Hence it can be said to be *my* decision, even if the 
conscious part of me was not highly involved.

The above argument needs a lot of refining (like many other
arguments in the age of cognitive neuroscience) to deal with a more 
complex image of volition and integrity. But developing a better 
theory of when something is merely persuasion (acceptable) and when   
it is brainwashing (unacceptable) will be very helpful for much 
future debates and social thinking.

### Ashamed, perhaps. Blamed - well, it depends on the local customs
regarding the duties of guardians of prepersons. Such customs should be
sufficiently simple and well-known to allow expectations to form, and at the
same time they should be subject (largely) to choice, by both parents and
(to a lesser degree) their children, e.g. by the expedient of polycentric
law.

### Nah, most people want to gain. Whether it occurs at other people's
expense, is a minor secondary consideration. In fact, with the exception of
egalitarians, who see the gain of others as an affront to themselves, and
would prefer to even personally lose if it's needed to ruin others, most
people would rather gain *and* profit others at the same time. It feels
better, I can tell you that.

No way.  I taught my son to count like this:

Daddy, may I have some candy?

Sure, son, how much would you like?

Five.

(I give him three)

Thanks, dad!

How many did I give you son?

Hmmmmmm.  Three, hey!  Give me more.

How many more, son?

etc.

My son can count/ad/subtract and he's 3 1/2!

Skepticism is a very very good teacher.

"What does not kill us makes us stronger."

Now I just have to teach him that he can trust me SOMETIMES.

Anyone think I'm a monster?

Richard Janko on Philodemus

Understanding one of the richest periods in the history of human thought

<begin quote>

In 1986, browsing among the new periodicals in a college library in
America, I came across an article by a recently deceased Italian
scholar. In it he lamented that nobody had noticed his work on a
papyrus from Herculaneum, first published in 1955. In his edition he
had shown that new fragments of Aristotle's lost dialogue On Poets
are cited in a work on literary theory by the poet and philosopher
Philodemus, who was the teacher of Vergil and, probably, of Horace,
the greatest poets of Augustan Rome.

Two years earlier I had published a book, Aristotle on Comedy,
arguing that the lost second Book of Aristotle's Poetics, on comedy
and laughter (celebrated in Umberto Eco's novel The Name of the
Rose), had not actually perished entirely, but survived in a summary
in a medieval manuscript in Paris. So new fragments of Aristotle's
poetic theory, wherever they might be found, were of the greatest
interest to me. Hence I went for the first time to the National
Library in Naples, the home of the papyri preserved by the eruption
of Vesuvius, to restudy this text. Fragile, brittle, black as coal,
it was the hardest thing which I had ever tried to read. But my
excitement was great as I managed, using a microscope, to read more
of the text and thus to confirm the Italian scholar's theory.

While I was there, I looked at a few other manuscripts in the
collection. Many were very extensive indeed-and completely
unpublished. Looking at one which was full of quotations of Greek
poetry, I said to one of the local scholars that he ought to publish
it. He said he was too busy with other papyri, and I had to confess
that I was also. But this made me aware of how much remains to be
done, even in the absence of finds of more texts from resumed
excavations at Herculaneum.

This is the only scholarly library from Greek and Roman antiquity to
have been preserved in conditions which ensured its physical
survival. Other ancient texts, like Aristotle's Poetics, survive
because they were copied and recopied by monks; but not these. They
are unique in every sense, and do much to bridge the gulf in ancient
philosophical writing between the time of Aristotle and that of
Cicero. Philodemus' On Poems, in particular, opens a window onto a
lost age of scholarship-the period between Aristotle's Poetics and
Horace's Art of Poetry, the works which define classicism for the
ancient and modern worlds. I felt that it was time for the On Poems
to be restored to the world in as complete a state as possible.

New techniques for reading the papyri-better microscopes, better
photographs, digital enhancement, infra-red images-came along at
just the right time. In France and America, two scholars had
independently rediscovered the key to putting the mutilated
fragments back into the correct order. The work remained laborious
and terribly difficult; but it was now possible. As I prepared the
first volume in Oxford's new series, which aims to edit all the
aesthetic treatises of Philodemus, the team of scholars whom I
brought together to undertake this exciting task made other
discoveries which all contribute to our ability to reconstruct this
lost library, and with it to understand one of the richest periods
in the history of human thought.

The oxymoron of "Cheerful libertarianism" is almost as outrageous and 
wonderful as "Compassionate libertarianism".  Now wouldn't it be great to 
have a coalescence of smart liberals and compassionate libertarians 
starting a new party called CFFD - Compassionate libertarians for Democracy 
:-)  In fact, I'm surprised that no one is using a more contemporary name 
for a political party, since wide use of extant acronyms and abbreviations 
has become commonplace.

Rand is a primer for righteousness-addition.  I just watched "The Passions 
of Ayn Rand" again the other night on TV and felt sick afterward.  I 
realize that she may have had a neurological or chemical imbalance in her 
50s, or perhaps it was a very difficult menopause, but gee wiz.  The

on a literary level.

You mean keeping them in their mud huts?  What USUALLY happens is the 
peasants revolt and are put-down occasionally by their

Where do you get your stats?

Here's a good place to start: http://corporatism.tripod.com/poverty.htm

As a matter of fact, poverty is up worldwide.

"There is a sucker, born every minute" - Barnum

Rhetorical questions to which I know the answer.  Do you?

What is the current population of the earth?
What percentage are "poor"?
Has that changed significantly over time?

______________________________________________

Personal questions directed to the point:

Rafal, are you a multi-millionaire?

Do you want to be?
How do you think someone like you could accumulate the effective labor 
of lots of other people without actually performing that labor yourself?

If you are a multi-millionaire:

How will you continue to benefit from your economic status without 
continuing to keep other people working for you?
How will you keep them working for you if it's not in their best 
interest?

Ostracism is a form of coercion - "Leave your house OR ELSE".

If you want to redefine coercion for your little moral system, go for 
it, just don't expect anyone else to follow you down the road.

The project of defining morality by "what most people want" is hopeless 
and silly, you can see yourself going down that path here.

"Most People" are smart enough to know that if you take someone else's 
job, they lose it.  That's called gaining at someone else's expense.  
If they're ignorant of this rule, they were poorly brought up.  You may 
ignorantly think that you can acquire billions and billions of dollars 
without actually hurting anyone, but that just makes you ignorant, 
certainly not moral.

Stop being stupid.

Is there a Queen of England?  A Bank of England?  A Barclays?  An FMR 
Corporation?

I don't know anything about kabal/illuminati/etc.  I do know that the 
wealthy use their power to keep their power and that has NEVER EVER 
CHANGED.  Has it?

Can you site examples for us when the wealthy have decided voluntarily 
to let the lower-and-middle-classes share in their power?

This reminds me, though I have no concrete plans to reproduce, I keep 
thinking about what I would do if it fell to me to teach survival skills 
to a fledgling.

I think I'd make allowance merit- and negotiation-based. Examples:

1) "Applicant Initiated Grant Proposal"
You want a talking Poke-Tubby? Tell you what, do a search on the 
internet on where I can buy you one, and write me a short paragraph 
saying why you think this Poke-Tubby will be more fun for you than other 
toys I could buy you for the same price, or other toys I've bought you 
in the past. Extra points for coming up with clever arguments.

2) "Call for Proposals"
There was an old guy named Robert Heinlein who wrote some interesting 
books for kids your age. If you write me a one-page book report or do a 
five-minute 'seminar' on one of his books, there will be XX 
yen/egolds/whatever-we'll-be-using-for-money-by-then in it for you, if 
it's as good as or better than the Isaac Asimov report you did last week.

3) "Matching Funds"
Here's XX rands/neo-rubles/whatever for you (thanks for defragging the 
family PC). It's yours to spend as you like, but for every 
rand/neo-ruble you put into saving up for that glow-in-the-dark hamster 
you wanted, I'll add a rand/neo-ruble of my own.

That way, real life won't take them by surprise... they'll have already 
developed intuitions for how to go about getting what they want (rather 
than just 'gimme!').

Also, people, kids especially, are visual/tactile learners. How much 
easier it would have been for me to understand valence interactions of 
the common atoms if I had a molecular model kit to play with when I was 
a kid. Same complexity level as a tinker-toy, but communicates 
supposedly high school level concepts. Likewise, visible man/woman, 
microscopes, telescopes, bread-boards for circuitry... can anybody think 
of good toys for developing intuitions for calculus, evolution, algorithms?

As far as I can see, he's just leaving it up to you
to make that call, instead of trying to decide for
you.  If you believe that the penalties built into
the contract are too low to risk your life for, then
you're certainly right to pay the penalties rather
than risk your life.

The great thing about markets is that they allow *you*
to make these decisions about what's worth more to
you, rather than having "society" make decisions about
where to draw the line of responsibility.

Oh, I was just being lazy in constructing the hypothetical scenario. I

Robbie and Rafal... you are slinging the term 'morality' back and forth
unexamined as if it's an objective concept you both agree on and merely
disagree on the details of implementation. I recently posted something
on the Genomics Yahoogroup that has just become relevant here...

----------
One of the problems plaguing the field of ethics is a pair of
contradictory assumptions at its very core:

"Some things are right and some things are wrong, and we need to know
the difference."

"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion."

I propose that ethics should be redefined as...

"An ontology for clearly stating what your particular system of axioms
is, coming to logical conclusions/decisions based on these axioms, and
communicating your axioms and your process of reasoning based on them to
others."

Here's an example of how this more honest and rigorous approach to
ethics would work:

Bob is a Christian. Bob states his axioms.

"I hold the following beliefs to be axiomatic-- God exists, and the
Bible expresses God's will. In places where the Bible is not clear, the
literal interpretation is to favored."

Bob then states his conclusions.

"Based on what is written in the Bible, killing humans is wrong, unborn
fetuses are human, and therefore abortion is wrong."

Jane is a secular humanist. Jane does not share Bob's axioms, but
aknowledges that they are axioms and not directly subject to debate. She
can do the following, though...

a) She can point out contradictions within Bob's chosen set of axioms,
forcing him to assign priorities to the various axioms he holds.

b) She can challenge the chain of reasoning leading from Bob's axioms
(the Bible expresses God's will) to Bob's conclusions (abortion is wrong).

c) If the above approaches both fail, Jane and Bob can agree to disagree.

Note that in the event of c), this disagreement isn't always peaceful,
unfortunately. As an extreme example, if Bob's axioms were to explicitly
include the statement "Blow up abortion clinics" and Jane was an
owner/employee/customer of an abortion clinic, then Bob and Jane will
inevitably find themselves in conflict at whatever level permitted by
the society they exist in and their level of commitment to their
respective axioms. But at least Bob, Jane, and any bystanders would have
a clear idea of what specifically the conflict was about... and whether
or not the underlying issue has been resolved, voiding the conflict. For
example, if safe and inexpensive removal/storage/transplantation of
embryos became possible, Bob and Jane would no longer have reason to
quarrel-- after all, Bob never stated that "Sex without intent to
procreate is wrong" and Jane never stated that "fetuses must be killed".

Instead of this, ethics debates today seem to rely on appeal to
authority and some kind of imaginary universal concept of right and
wrong. It's FRAUDULENT to use value-implying terms without first clearly
identifying your values so your audience can make up their own minds as
to whether your idea of "right", "good", "natural", and "humane"
corresponds to their own. The approach I've outlined above will help
expose individuals who are trying to conceal their own agenda underneath
some kind of blanket "consensus" or "prevailing social norms".

There should be something equivalent to Godwin's Law that gets triggered
when someone talks about 'morality' without saying exactly what that
word signifies to them.

PS: The original purpose of this thread was to figure out how not to get
the crack-pot treatment from fellow scientists at a vulnerable, early
point in our careers. But what the heck, ethics is an interesting and
important topic too.

What do you mean by "power"?  Knowledge, Influence, jobs, benefits, 
advantages?

In sharing position, benefits, and advantage, 2 people come to mind 
immediately:

Dr. Richard Clark:  plastic surgeon:  Has voluntarily donated time and 
money to help people with physical complications regain their limbs, face, 
or other body parts.

Pamela Lifton-Zoline:  writer/artist:  Has voluntarily donated money to 
help children of low income families get an education through a school she 
established.  (Just one of her many contributions to lower income families.)

As I see it he's saying I'm morally wrong for not fulfilling my 
obligation to deliver his widgets at the risk of my own life, whereas 
if I fail to save my kids for the same reason, that's okay.

Sounds plainly stupid to me.

Actually, they coerce you into making decisions based on monetary 
concerns rather than ethical concerns.  Hence the need for the removal 
of the LLC.  You can see in corporate America today the contradictions 
brought on by the LLC taking real form.

But when the initiators of force are a large segment of society, or the
government, stepping in to stop that can require you taking over the society,
involving a lot of coercion.  Even if your coercion is simply taking over the
governmental functions of the overly-coercive government you're overthrowing,
the fact that it's you doing it and not the old, traditional gang may be felt
as new coercion by the population.

Like if someone wanted to stop US force against drug users, they'd have to
step in at a rather deep level.  You're not just stopping an act, you're
messing with a whole system.  Ditto with stopping slavery in the South.  It's
not the same as stopping a single mugging; the scale and interactions are
different.

Okay, I thought you were just talking about a contract. I'm
not sure there is a single objective morality, so I don't
argue about it anymore. :)

Well, limited liability is a State-enforced distortion of
the market, rather than something inherent in the market.
I agree that limited liability should be abolished.

### As Alex noted in a recent post, it is useful to state what one means by
one's "morality". I did it some time ago, and in the paragraph above I
provided an interpretation of your question within the ethical system I
espouse. Of course, since your moral system, and the whole Weltanschauung,
are different than mine, my system has no basis from your point of view.
However, as Alex writes, we can compare notes and try to point out internal

Do it.

Randall Randall made an excellent comment in this context, too.

### Maybe for you. In other words, if I was to ever consider buying
something from you, I would have to worry that you will default on the
contract, because, as you admit, you don't care about your word. Well, this
needs to be remembered.

### Maybe I used a term which could be interpreted as something else -
banishment. The sanction in merchant law is not banishment, it is avoidance,
expulsion from the community, but not expropriation. Also, merchant law is
first voluntarily accepted by its users, in contrast to king's law. It is
not coercion.

### Now, you are saying I am infantile. Well, this makes an exchange of
arguments somewhat more difficult, doesn't it?

Basically, you apply the word "coercion" to the outcomes of large numbers of
people making decisions without use of fraud or non-contractual use of
physical force (=the definition of the free market). In this way, the
previously rather precise term (coercion = the use of non-contractual
physical force against a person, or threat thereof) becomes rather vague, a
term of abuse, and an expression of dislike. You may dislike the free
decisions of other people, and define any influence you disagree with as
"coercive", but redefinition of common terms only interferes with
discussions, and as I wrote, makes exchange of arguments more difficult.

### Yes, in most cases, the procedures I mentioned come up with an

morality based on getting people what they want is a silly and hopeless

### They keep trying - but they are losing, century by century, decade by
decade. Today's advanced capitalist societies have a dramatically lower
level of power concentration and inequality (although some are plagued by a
proliferation of mass special interest groups opposed to long-term economic
growth, like labor unions, or the retired).

The Queen of England has hardly anything to say outside her castles, poor
lady.

Don't be so envious and angry at the rich. Relax. They are human, too. You
are not necessarily poorer because somebody gets rich. Positive-sum games do
exist.

### (context elided - show how capital investment increases incomes)

Oh, by simple calculations, by experiments, by observations of markets. The
whole of economics, ever since Adam Smith, describes the effects of supply
and demand on the price and availability of goods and services. Even
Keynesians admit such basics. Are you aware of any alternative economic
theory, which would deny the right of supply and demand?

I guess it elevates one's mood, to find so many things laughable. Have fun,
by all means.

### If I remember correctly, you have never explained how capitalism causes

### Yes, the percentage of poor changed - from 100% about 8 000 years ago,

But now I see why you need to laugh at the least provocation - your have to

A very good post, Alex. I hoped that I stated something similar to the
system of axioms and the general concept of ethics you describe, somewhere
in the previous parts of the thread, but maybe not forcefully enough to
avoid the impression that I am trying to assert an objective system of
morals.

By all means, I have only a bunch of suggestions about the effective means
of achieving goals, as well as a short list of goals which I hope that
others might find worthwhile, such as finding the social system giving the
average human the best chances at getting what he/she/it individually wants.

### Why? Don't forget that tort liability (and this is the liability we are
talking about) is a almost always a function of the state court system, so
its limitations/extensions are not a matter of physical law, but malleable
convention, to a larger extent than e.g. contract law, which has a more
direct recourse to game theory, and reciprocity-based moral intuitions.

I see no reason why limited liability should be prohibited. This legal
convention allowed some increases in investment, especially for poor people.
Tort liability in this context can be satisfied by liability insurance
carried by the LLC. The assessment of risk performed by professional
adjusters for the insurance providers would determine the premiums, which
directly translate into increased stock prices of dangerous companies, and
provides incentives for limiting liability exposure (by e.g. adopting safer
business practices).

Without limited liability, stock owners would assume unlimited liability,
and only the professionals or the foolhardy can do that repeatedly.
Alternatively, only stocks carrying sufficient liability insurance would be
widely traded, but this would not differ from an LLC with insurance in
anything but name.

Abolishing LLC would change little in the economy, except for some names,
decreased reliance on stock for funding, increases in reliance on credit,
and maybe increased use of commercial insurance by businesses. The
non-professional investor would lose, and consumers would not gain.

According to the Bible, Abraham had 200 tents and thousands of

Poverty is NOT less than 20% - even in the United States.

Truly sad indeed.

Hope for future is an empirical question.  I think my life will be very 
pleasant.  Do I think that the rest of the world will have as pleasant 
a life as mine, no.

I like to call it cold realism.  You should try it.

So are you just ignorant of the political repression in Burma that

jobs?

Exactly, if given a choice between fulfilling my contract and saving my

If I were you, I would consider this a universal caveat on monetary

Exactly.  If you take away "king's law" then I'd agree with you, 
however, the "king's law" tends to impinge on "merchant law".

You seem to be denying the interaction.  You're familiar with the 
concept of "State Sponsored Monopoly" right?

In the United States, Land is a state-sponsored monopoly.  Banks can 
print money (or borrow at randomly low rates) and loan it to other at 
ever-increasingly-high amounts and rates.  This has the effect of 
making the banks the effective owners (eg, holding more than 80% of the 
equity position) in "most houses" owned by poor people.  The banks are 
put in this position whereas individual people are not - making the 
competition for real estate unfair.

This system is backed-up by the repossession laws which makes it 
outright coercion.

Sorry, I thought you were offering an alternative definition for 
"coercion" like you are for "morality".

If you were to give up the terms "Right and wrong" in your discourse, 
we would have no further disagreements, clearly.

Simliarly with coercion.  If you say it's "bad" but then identify it 
completely differently then what's the point of saying it's bad?

In fact, what's the point of saying it's bad since you say "There's no 
objective standard of bad."

This amounts, if you ask me, to the simple contradiction:

No things are bad.
Coercion is bad.

You can't have it both ways - either things are bad, or they're not.

Governments provide non-contractual physical force necessary to make 
any given market "non-free".  Occasionally people do it as well.

You've already said "There's no objective good and bad."

Well, if there are two things and I have both, you don't.

If you want one, you've got to take it.  I could give it to you, but 
then I'd have less.  You'd have to trade something, but there's only 
the two things.

The earth has a limited amount of fundamental resources - Land, Food, 
Energy, human effort, etc.  We can re-arrange the distribution of these 
items a lot (that's what the global economy IS...) but it doesn't 
usually create NET more land, food or human effort.

In fact, in light of the WTO, apparently we are now destroying more 
food year after year - you know to satisfy the "supply and demand" 
economics.

And yes, there are alternative value economic theories, Marx is the 
standard, I like the modifications by Istvan Meszaros.

In such cases I think it is irrational to expend that much energy and 
resources unless the population of said country is sufficiently ready to live 
in a more free state.  This readiness cannot be acheived by force.    Without 
this readiness the saying about teaching a pig to sing seems appropriate.  It 
will be terribly frustrating and only annoy the pig.

Actually, massive public disobedience to the drug laws along with juries 
fairly consistently refusing to hand down guilty verdicts should do the 
trick.  That is largely what got us past the first Prohibition.

>Let's see your legitimate "poverty is in decline" source.

"Study finds that globalization cures poverty"

"While acknowledging the number of poor people in the world remains
"disturbingly high," the study says that in 1950 about 55% of the
world's
population lived on less than US$1 a day (in constant,
inflation-adjusted
dollars). By 1992, only 24% of the world's population had to make do
with
that tiny amount."

"The proportion of the world's population living in absolute poverty is
lower now than it has ever been," the report says."

"poverty" is, of course, relative.  Define what you mean by it.  As of
1992, per this study, the global figure was at 24%, defined as $1 US
dollar per day.

Burma?  From the CIA world fact book

http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html

"Burma is a resource-rich country that suffers from abject rural
poverty. The military regime took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize
the economy after decades of failure under the "Burmese Way to
Socialism", but those efforts have since stalled. Burma has been unable
to achieve monetary or fiscal stability, resulting in an economy that
suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including a steep
inflation rate and an official exchange rate that overvalues the Burmese
kyat by more than 100 times the market rate. In addition, most overseas
development assistance ceased after the junta suppressed the democracy
movement in 1988 and subsequently ignored the results of the 1990
election. Burma is data poor, and official statistics are often dated
and inaccurate. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly
understated because of the size of the black market and border trade -
often estimated to be one to two times the official economy."

You act as if their choice appears to be a shitty job as a factory
worker or a non-shitty job as something other than a factory worker.  It
in fact appears their choices are shitty job as a factory work or
starving to death.  I know little of Burma, but this seems typical of
oppressive closed societies, do you have knowledge suggesting the
poverty in burma is FROM the multinational conglomerates?

Population below poverty line = 25%

No doubt the perpetuation of poverty is a complex issue, but lets not
forget that at the very least before agriculture and civilization
*everyone* was below poverty level, perpetually on the verge of
starvation.  I have read suggestions that at one point some 10's of
thousands of years ago the entire adult breeding population was as low
as 1,000 people.

Well here's one would-be Bayesian who is ready to get the 
"evil trick" explained.

I *loved* probability at secondary school as it seemed so
eminently useful and Bayes creates the same impression but
I find that I am frustrated by it in the same way. 

Whilst I had a good intuitive handle on probability I had a 
lot of trouble translating English language logic into the 
mathematical formalisms that facilitate easier handling.
It was like putting the terms into mathematically formal
language was a language translation that I couldn't easily
do.

Intuitively I can see that at round two there are nine chips
total and either 3 or 4 of those 9 are white. Because of the
rules that mean an early white increases the number of whites
latter I can see that at the point when their are 11 chips in
round 4, the fact of a white in round 2 would mean more
of the 11 were likely to be white AND vice versa. I.e.. Given
a white IS chosen from the 11 the chips in round 4, this 
probability tells us something about the likelihood that a white
was drawn in round 2 (it is higher than an even chance) but
that's where the wheels come off for me. I can't yet put these
facts into formal mathematical language (at least I think that's
my problem). I have the same problem with the formal rules
in Godel, Esher and Bach. Taking English language logic to
mathematical formalism and getting the benefits of being able
to manipulate the symbols is where I struggle.

I did take a look at your excruciatingly gentle introduction
to Bayes, (I liked it. It helped, and is worth a closer look)
but for now I' m ready to see the evil trick when you are
ready to reveal it  ;-)

Regards,
Brett

Ah, and so many extropian list members thought there were no communists
on board.  Jeff Davis, you have a buddy, someone who shares your idea
that a moral communist state can exist.  Sure, it may, but no communist
state has ever come close to being moral, and Robbie, I am surprised to
hear you make such comments, since there is NO FORM OF GOVERNMENT that
is farther from extropian as communist ones have been.  But alas, I am
sure you are holding out for that perfect extropian communist government
eh? Maybe one of those ingorant peasant farmers will bring about the
singularity.  As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated
more wealth than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been because
it was exploiting the working man, right?

A dollar a day is a lot in some places.

let's define poverty as:

Inability to afford simultaneously health care, food and shelter.

According to the UN report (which I take to be a relatively biased  
report, requiring the consent of the 5 most powerful nations in the  
world....)

http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/action/actionindex.htm
	as well as excerpted here:
http://www.richmonddiocese.org/ojp/ojp121.htm

In the 1990's, the number of people surviving on less than $1/day was  
halved IN EAST ASIA (my emphasis).

Still, human development is proceeding too slowly, for many countries,  
the 1990's were a decade of despair.  Some 54 (out of 125 "developing"  
countries) are poorer now than in 1990.  In 21 a larger proportion of  
people is going hungry.  In 14, more children are dying before age 5.   
In 12, primary school enrollments are shrinking (notably India).  In  
34, life expectancy has fallen.  SUCH REVERSALS IN SURVIVAL WERE  
PREVIOUSLY RARE (my emphasis).

But in Latin America and the  Caribbean, the Arab States, Central and  
Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa  the number of people living on  
less than $1 a day increased. Moreover, at the  current pace,  
sub-Saharan Africa would not reach the target for poverty  reduction  
until 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. And both HIV/AIDS and   
hunger in Africa are heading up -- not down.

The  report notes that in the 1990s average per-capita income growth  
was less than 3%  in 125 developing  countries.  In 54 of these  
nations, average per-capita  income fell -- 20 in sub-Saharan Africa,  
17 in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, 6  in  
Latin America  & the Caribbean, 6 in East Asia & the Pacific, and 5 in  
the Arab States.

Why?

One common reason is poor governance. When  governments are corrupt,  
incompetent or unaccountable to their citizens,  national economies  
falter.

Now, if you were the president of Burma and Nike were to offer you and  
your sweat-shop owning buddies a coupla million to put down revolts.   
AND if the US government were selling you weapons at discounted rates,  
you might just do it.

Granted and affirmed, the Burmese government SUCKS.

http://www.csun.edu/CommunicationStudies/ben/news/961120.disney.html

For instance, there's loads of this stuff.

> Population below poverty line = 25%

Again, depending on how you define poverty.  There are people who live  
in the United States on $20k/year that I think are poor by the standard  
above - can they simultaneously afford  (adequate)  health-care,   
food/water and shelter?

> *everyone* was below poverty level,

So things have been better for only 8000 years.  Hmmm.

I look at it this way.  In every generation and in every time, there  
have been slaves and masters, genocides and wars justified by economic  
expansion and "progress".  Today is not different.  We just hide the  
word slavery under "obscenely poor".  As I told Rafal, if it REALLY  
makes you feel better to turn someone from a slave to a share-cropper  
fine, but that just means you don't understand the plight of the  
share-cropper.

Surely during the plague years, people dropped like flies.  Today's  
plagues are AIDS, Heart Disease and Cancer.  I gave references to the  
CDC before in this thread.  People are still dropping like flies - Ma  
nish tanah, ha lailah hazeh, mikohl ha-ley-lot.  But "since  
civilization" there've always been increases in raw numbers of people  
as far as I know.

Robbie

Sometime in the past two weeks, I briefly saw a posting on (maybe) 
slashdot, re some article discussing mankind deliberately devolving into 
a nonsentient species as an end result of adapting to the environment 
(this considered being cheaper than the reverse). I have scanned and 
searched /. archives and google to no effect. Perhaps someone on this 
list noticed it.

Thanks,

The only thing of value is personal time.  In such exchanges, all are

The earth itself has no wealth.  Only the people on it have wealth and

And we destroy more of it now than any time in human history in order 
to keep our "supply and demand" theory going.  After all, if what you 
said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in Westwood

Not a communist - peaceful anarchist (like a libertarian who doesn't 
think that governments should prop-up corporations or monetary systems 
any more than they should subsidize pork-bellies).

Marx was an anarchist too, BTW.  The difference is one of 
methodology/praxis.  The anarchist desires to immediately dissolve the 
government.  The Communist wishes to put up a temporary government in 
order to advance to a state of anarchy later by that means.  The way I 
see it, communism as a methodology has demonstrated itself to be 
inadequate for achieving the goal which is the simple removal of forced 
alienation of our labor.

If you don't think the alienation of your labor is forced - stop paying 
taxes and wait.

There is no good form of government.  Government is essentially an 
alienation of rights from the individual.

"The only good government is a dissolved government."

where young people and especially teens are disrespectful

Gee. Its pretty amazing, to me anyway, that *any* manuscripts of
Aristotle or Plato in existence anywhere would not by now have
been deemed worthy of someone's translation efforts.

Almost scary in a way. I think we (humans) often assume that
things that would be of interest to ourselves (and presumably
at least a bunch of others) will get translated by someone if we
don't do it. {I don't qualify in this case though, as alas, everything
except English is "all Greek to me"}. I await developments
in language translation software with some enthusiasm and hope
to order my Babel fish early.

Scary that so much, so worth doing, can be left undone after so
many generations. Makes boredom almost look like a sin.

Carpe diem, I guess.

Brett

Could be that the Saudi thesaurus has pages devoted to 
decadent and immoral, but I wonder if they've a hit for
"totally suck"?  

Anyone seen Mez of late?

So if I trade one hour of my time, as my skill as a welder say, for one
hour of your time, as your skill as a carpenter, who loses and who wins?
If it is zero sum, there must be a winner and a loser.  Are you a loser
merely because I would not do the welding for no trade whatsoever?

Effort?  As in what, physical labor?  Calories expended?  What about
people who sit in front of a computer all day processing information,
turning not so valuable information into more valuable information.  Is
there a limit to the value that can be imparted unto information?  As a
different example, every kilogram of gasoline contains within it 12,000
Watts for an hour.  That's about 16 Horsepower, or say about 32 people
power per hour.  Oxidizing one kilogram of petrol is the same as having
32 strong youthfull slaves at your beck and call for one full hour.
Whose effort are you using?  You can do the work that previously took 32
people to do.  In fact, modern farmers in post-industrialized nations do
the work of 100 workers at the turn of the century.  That's *one*
farmer.  His 'effort' is 100 times more productive than it would have
been a century before.  Does this not demonstrate that 'effort' as
directed through technology has no limit to its value?

Not sure what exactly you mean by keeping our "supply and demand" theory
going, especially when you quoted 
[http://www.maketradefair.org/stylesheet.asp?file=03042002121618&cat=2&s
ubcat=6&select=1] in your previous post which said "The international
community has failed to address the problem of low and unstable
commodity prices, which consign millions of people to poverty. Coffee
prices, for example, have fallen by 70 per cent since 1997"  How do you
propose keeping Coffee prices at the original level *without* dumping
some significant amount of Coffee into the ocean?  How is 'addressing
unstable commodity prices' any different than keeping up "supply and
demand" theories?  

After all, if what you 
>said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in Westwood 

Why not?  If you can make a BLT cheaper, start your own BLT joint.

Ok, your libertarian descriptions fit me as well, yet I certainly
wouldn't call myself a 'peacefull anarchist' (how do you propose it
remain 'peacefull' anarchy, btw?) I despise corporate subsidy and the
general interference of the market by rediculous government intrusion.
But I would like to hear more of what kind of system you would propose.
I often mull over questions of moral state's and perfect societies.
Does your peacefull Anarchist society have property rights?  Who
enforces them?  What if I, as an intelligent reasonable person plan
aheard for foul weather by storing extra food, yet my neighboors, who I
warned of foul weather, did not head my advice and are no starving.  Do
they have a right to take my provisions?  Who forces the Doctor to treat
my ailments to achieve 'adequate' health care?  Especially If I can not
pay him, and no government exists to coerce him.  Shall my best friend
just hold a gun to his head?  (Oh, right, you said a 'peacefull
anrachist', I suppose Ill just ask him politely to perform required
operation)  Truthfully, I don't understand how this system could
possibly exist, unless each and every person in it is immortal,
perpetually healthy, and always with shelter and food.

Is that so?  I guess most communist governements just never got to sit
around long enough to turn into full anarachies.  

How does peaceful anarachy alleviate global poverty?  (food, shelter,
and adequate health care)

  The way I 
>see it, communism as a methodology has demonstrated itself to be 
>inadequate for achieving the goal which is the simple removal 
>of forced 
>alienation of our labor.

'Inadequate'?  That's an understatement if I have ever heard one,
considering it is responsible for 170 million deaths this century.  What
is 'forced alienation of our labor' and what about volunteer labor.  I
also note, we can not exist without labor, we must labor for our food.
How is that dichotomy settled?  Food will not fall from the sky and into
your mouth, and with no government to provide it, where will it come
from?  

>If you don't think the alienation of your labor is forced - stop paying

>taxes and wait.

And where is where my understanding has serious gaps.  I don't
understand 'alienation' used in this context.  Can you elaborate on
this?  I have no doubt my labor is forced.  If I chose to stop working,
I would lose my house.  But if I just chose to sit around somewhere, I
would starve to death.  Who is the unlucky fellow forced to feed me so I
will not be forced into labor?

I just cant envision a manifestation of this society you talk about.  Do
you work?  Do you grow food?  Do you sit around all day and chew peyote
buttons?  Do you exchange efforts for other peoples efforts?  How do you
exchange it?  Is the effort of a rock thrower equal in value to the
effort of a brain surgeon?  How do you contend with the variations in
the value of peoples abilities and efforts?  I have little need for rock
throwers, but need computer programmers.

>There is no good form of government.  Government is essentially an

Agreed, tentatively.  But are some governments 'less bad' than others?
Say, for example, Pol Pot's Cambodia vs. Australia?

No, but I don't see how any of the ideas you propose would make it
objectively make it likely that you would live any longer.  Though I

Did the people of singapore live better lives than the people of the

Evil Hint #1:  Not only is it possible for you to do this problem in your

Friends, at the heart of it, this is surely why these
people are escalating world war 4: they can't seem to
*make* anything.  They seem incapable of generating
wealth, other than by selling their natural resources
for a song.  Selling oil doesn't actually create wealth,
it merely distributes it.  Microsloth, Apple, IBM and
Sun Microsystems create wealth.  

Why do we have *nothing* in our homes made in Iraq?  
In Iran?  In any predominantly Muslim nation?  Why is it 
that they need to import foreign skill to get anything 
built?  Of course it leads to terrible culture wars; 
it gives them such a deep seated self-hatred that they 
treat their women as less than dogs.  They feel threatened 
by a freaking *doll* fer cryin out loud.
  
Perhaps the answer to middle eastern conflict is to 
somehow inject a huge dose of unfettered capitalism.  
How?  spike

Each person should be able to determine the value of their own time.  
That's what freedom is.

If you say "I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour."

I might do it, I might not.  Depends on how I feel, if I'm free, etc.

I don't.  I don't subscribe to the "commodity" supply and demand 
theory.  I said so above - value is given by human effort.  My 
conjecture is that the coffee spilt that way was thusly spilt to 
bolster the price in a waning market.  This is what happens when the 
notional supply and demand are used as cover for global capital and it 
shows the underlying contradictions in the notion.

"Efficient markets"  If the theory is that food is becoming more 
available with time, it SHOULD follow that it would become less 
expensive with time too, right?

Unless, that is, it is the service and effort of BRINGING THE FOOD TO 
ME that I'm paying for which far outweighs the value of the underlying 
food.

I pay the $8.95 because even though I know I could buy a baby-pig for 
$8.95 and raise to a 1000-pound pig for around $100, enough to make 
about 5-10,000 BLT's (really hammy-ones), I don't because the trouble 
of dealing with it is worth paying for - that's the human effort part.

Me Too.

Me, you, them.  If, as you say, there's plenty of food, land and water, 
there shouldn't be any problem.

People would have to recognize the value of what they'd achieved to 
make it worth keeping.

> Do they have a right to take my provisions?

That's an ethical issue, not a legal one.  They have no right to steal 
from you, but you SHOULD share with them if you can, that would be "The 
right thing to do."

He should help you.  The Government isn't exactly helping right now.

> Shall my best friend

How about asking nicely, most people are reasonable when asked.  If the 
doctor knows that he can't extract unreasonable fees for his services, 
then he will ask for reasonable fees.  If a doctor becomes known as 
"That guy who cheats dying people" then his business would dry up 
pretty quick I imagine.

> (Oh, right, you said a 'peacefull

Sounds good, but I'd expect you to have planned well enough that you 
could pay a reasonable fee and/or contracted with some insurer.  (Who 
in turn would pay because if they didn't you'd be pissed and so would 
the rest of their customers.)

Maybe.  Maybe not.  I say it's worth a try because THIS isn't working.

It's an empirical question and so I am agnostic about it.  The Chinese 
government, if it's Communist, has an opportunity to become a 
government-less body.  I doubt that they will, personally.  You may be 
more optimistic.  Until they, no three-children chinese families.  The 
Russian Government clearly failed.

I take it that those two examples are the best evidence we have in the 
matter outside of small communes.

By letting people benefit from their own land and labor.

Right.

Forced alienation of our labor is TAXATION or other kinds of coerced 
(in the broad sense of "essentially forced") extraction of resources 
and time.

I expect a nice little farm might do the trick.  On the Kibutz groups 
of people come together to build farms that sustain them and then take 
turns on it.  That's ONE way.  Another way is just to farm your own 
land.   Another way is to provide a sufficiently valuable service that 
other people would simply give you food.

I know guitarists that make their livings this way, for instance.


>  If I chose to stop working,

Not stop working, we are in agreement that you must produce to provide 
for yourself.  Try stop paying taxes.

Alienation simply means taking something that was yours and making it 
someone else's.  Forced alienation is when someone MAKES you do it.

>   I have little need for rock
> throwers, but need computer programmers.

People manage to figure out valuable things that other people want.  
They don't need governments to show them how to do this.  Governments 
come in when small groups of people band together and force other 
people into submission by violence.

> Agreed, tentatively.  But are some governments 'less bad' than others?
> Say, for example, Pol Pot's Cambodia vs. Australia?

Not clear.  It may be that the underlying factors which support 
Australia also support Pol Pot.  I understand that the CIA was funding 
Pol Pot's campaign against his people.

Number one killer in America for males over 30 (me) - Heart Disease.  
Major cause of heart-disease - STRESS.  Major cause of stress - 
overwork.

Number 2 killer - Cancer.  Number 1 cause of cancer - unknown 
environmental factors.  I personally attribute them to the pollutants 
required by modern cities to keep the engines greased.

Which people?

I hear Gorby had a really, really nice limousine.  Maybe there were

I don't know.

Aaagh!  ;-)     But this (my effort below) ISN'T Bayes !

              (4/9 or 3/9)
      (3/8)

So  100% = 11
       5 + 4 =  100%

w is 25% more likely to come from a (r2 w chip) group
than the others.

P= 3/8 + 25% = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8

 =  62.5%

But this is *not* one step, I didn't do it in my head,
and I would not like to bet that 62.5% is right either ;-)

What's the Bayesian way?

Brett

Robert Weinberg, a notable cancer expert, sez not. (Except in especially
nasty hot-spots.) The rise is Western cancer incidence is in step with the
increase in longevity; the longer you live, the more onco prequel events
occur stochastically. Some of those are associated with modifiable diet
choices, of course. Meanwhile, we gain improved methods of fixing cancers
once they show up, and those methods are attributable to modern cities and
their greasy engines.

Well, I want to abolish the State itself as well, to be sure.  I would
say that it is illegitimate to remove liability in any sense by fiat,
rather than by contract with the affected individuals.  I'm not at all
sure that a privately produced legal system would have two different
kinds of "crime", since these seem to map directly to "crime against
an individual" and "crime against the State", except that lawmakers
consider murder to be more importantly a crime against the State than
against an individual, weirdly.  Therefore, when I suggest the
abolition of that entire class of crimes, I don't mean that every
crime in the class should be likewise abolished.

If we remove this obfuscation of offenses, so that all offenses are
against an individual or group of individuals, it's clear that
removing liability without the express consent of those who would
otherwise be able to collect damages is simply legalization of
aggression.

It isn't so much that it "should be prohibited" as that it has to be
specifically allowed, and you need a State (or universal agreement by
all actual and potential legal systems) to allow it.

Instead of having a separate requirement for carrying insurance, why not
let the managers/owners of the business itself choose whether to carry
such insurance?  Removing some market feedback mechanism (liability for
one's actions, in this case) always seems to require one or more other
changes.  Each of these changes distort the market in other areas in
some (possibly small) way, which eventually look like "market problems"
to politicians, who then campaign to fix them with more patches.

If, instead, you just use a rule of "one is responsible for one's own
actions", and rigorously enforce it, then exceptions which arise will
be purely voluntary and can be contract-based.  Liability cannot be
limited by fiat, but it can be assumed by contract, which will often
have the effect you want, above.

So other instruments that don't carry ownership would be created.  For
instance, you could have an instrument which was purely a debt-based
instrument, but which entitled the bearer to a share of the profits of
the enterprise, without any ownership of the enterprise.  This would
act the way you want stocks to act, without requiring a change in the
way the legal system works for the people involved.

It seems to me that a statement that little would change in the economy
is equivalent to a statement that you can centrally plan this aspect of
the economy, and by extension, all aspects which it touches.  I'm very
skeptical of this kind of statement, since I'm unaware of any clear
examples of the success of economic central planning.

I don't think it was /., it was likely me referring to a theory

As far as I am concerned, Mr. Gates more than made up for Excel with 
Windows. I still can't fix my Win2000 registry so I can properly install my 
virus scan suite. It was probably McAfee's fault, but shame on MS for 
making something that fragile. Excel, though, I use regularly, and with 
pleasure.

Anyway, which came first - Excel or Lotus 123? Seems to me Lotus was out 
first, and Microsoft stole their lunch...

I'm under the impression that complaints along those lines--you
forgot stupid and lazy--are documented since antiquity.

It seems every generation makes those claims about their youngsters.
Which is something I don't understand.  I'm not surprised that the
younger generation fails to understand the point of view of their
parents, but the elders have been young at one time and there is
no excuse for them not remembering.  Why are people so utterly blind
to any point of view but their own?

Actually, neither.  As I recall, I was working at Yourdon, Inc. in
the early 1980's when an individual, who if I recall correctly was
named Mark Pearson, developed the first spreadsheet application I
ever saw.  [I don't recall the name of the program.]  Of course it
was rather cumbersome since windows did not exist so one was running
it on standard 23x80 terminals.  I think subsequently VisiCalc became
the first well known spreadsheet application.  Then came Lotus 123
followed by Excel.  Can't google come up with something on the
"history of spreedsheets"?

Also, on a related topic -- Java was not designed by Bill Joy, it
was designed by James Gosling [1].

I'm skeptical.  Humanity has too much potential to modify the
environment given its current biotechnological or future
nanotechnological skills.  Evolving to a phase state where
there are fewer humans?  Perhaps.  Evolving to a phase state
where most humans are uploaded?  Sure.  Devolving rather than
manipulating the environment?  I don't think so.  The survival
instinct is too strong.

Does raise an interesting perspective with regard to the Fermi
Paradox though.  If you *know*, and I mean *really* know, that the
universe is doomed to collapse or expand/decay into nothingness --
does that eventually (on relatively short time scales relative
to the age of the universe) sap the will of a species to survive?

I've argued in the past that there is no interstellar "colonization"
drive because it is pointless.  It can be pointless because there is
no benefit to oneself (and in fact involves a significant sacrifice --
leaving behind the knowledge/culture of an advanced civilization).
It can be pointless because one potentially creates future competitors
for what remains of the resources in the universe.  Or finally it
can be pointless because one concludes there really is no way out.

On the anniversary of 911, I watched a program on the PBS program
"American Experience", which contained a minute or two of video
footage of people hurling themselves out of the burning towers
because there was no other "way out".  How would a species react
if it ultimately concluded there was no "way out"?

To see why you didn't need to brute-force it, try calculating the
probability that the third chip was white given that the first chip was
white, or the probability that the first chip was white given that the
second chip was white.  Also 4/9.

In fact, for any j != k, p(Wj|Wk) == 4/9, provided that the only other 
information given is as described above.  So if we knew only that the 
sixty-seventh chip was white, we would estimate a 4/9 probability that the 
twenty-third chip was white.

Since all bowls of this kind possess this symmetry, we can find the 
constant for any particular bowl by estimating the probability that the 
second chip was white, given that the first chip was white.  If we got a 
white chip on the first round, we would add one white chip for the second 
round, making the probability of a white chip 4/9.  This is then the same 
as the probability that a white chip was drawn on the second round, given 
that a white chip was drawn on the fourth round.

Thanks for the responses. I could be hallucinating, but I could swear 
the article was on slashdot.

Robert Bradbury writes:

> Paradox though.

Agreed. Actually, I was interested in the 'cheerful libertarianism' 
thread, but am still reading Brin's article. I've heard Brin previously 
praise Star Trek for its take on gradual improvement of existing 
institutions (as opposed to the 'romantic' solutions of Star Wars or LOTR).

Trying to synthesize in Robert Anton Wilson's notions of 'internalized 
strange loops', my (not claimed as original) concept of 'Temporal 
Pollution' discussed months ago, torturing children (per a recent post, 
something we can all agree is a bad thing, except that people have been 
torturing children (esp. girls) for millenia (and continue to do so)), 
and genocide, which seems the same way (agree it's bad, do it anyway).

This somewhat dark mood perhaps due to recently viewing the anime 
Boogiepop Phantom, which (like much anime) tortures children, the motif 
of much anime seeming to me to be 1) there is something only you can do 
(often, pilot a giant mecha), and 2) people will suffer (or the world 
will be destroyed) if you don't do that and instead do what you want to 
do. Thinking of suicide as often a theme in anime, the movie 'The Virgin 
Suicides', thinking about the effect of being sued by the RIAA when 
you're a 12-year old girl...

Mixing in thoughts about capitalism changing from 'let's produce a good 
or service and see if people will value it' to 'gaming the system', 
where you replace your workmen and engineers with lawyers, wondering if 
we aren't headed for some sort of deadlock, by which I mean perhaps 
humanity failed the Great Filter test, and we just haven't gotten to the 
consequences yet...

The romance notions which Brin decries seem imho out of touch with where 
we find ourselves, as perhaps 'the last moral generation'. Seems to me 
that if we are in some higher powers' virtual reality, this would be an 
era of intense interest (pre-singualirity).

I know little about neural nets, but understand that they can become 
deadlocked too in a sense, and need some sort of reset, and wondering if 
our civilization is the same way. Religion being perhaps the best 
example, with armageddon on one side and jihad on the other, it's hard 
to see how such an institution can be 'improved'.

Anyway, discuss this brain fart among yourselves, I need to get back to 
work :-)

Reference already provided:

The database is roughly searchable.

It MAY be that cancer is more likely to happen because we're getting 
older, we KNOW that there are more polutants around.  We KNOW that the 
pollutants cause cancer.  We don't KNOW that age does.  Although it 
seems tautological - if increased exposure to pollutants causes cancer, 
then the longer you are exposed to them, the more likely you are to get 
cancer, hence the older you are, the more likely you are, etc.

While the conjecture is an important one, it doesn't make it more than 
a contributing factor - GIVEN that we KNOW that increased stress, 
pollutants, alcohol, tobacco, smog, heavy-metals, food-poisons, etc. 
are cancer-causing.

Best,

Well, my idea of months ago was to ship all marketing folks to muslim

It's a win-win situation, even in the unfortunate circumstance of them

"Zero Sum" means that the sum adds up to zero, there is a winner and a
loser.  Basketball games are zero sum, both teams can not be winners.
Non zero sum means both parties can be winners, though one may not when
as much as the other, they both come out on top.  The classic example of
this is the prisoners dilemma game, in which two people are accused of a
crime, if either defects they get off scott free, but the other gets a
stiff sentence.  However, if they both cooperate, they both get off with
light sentances.  These exchanges exist throughout nature, in the way
animals share food (vampire bats, for instance) and the way individuals
trade goods.  Non-zero sum models accurate predict all of these systems,
they are certainly no zero sums.  I suggest reading Matt Ridley's "The
Origins of Virtue"  

When you say 'niether loses nor gains' is that an objective statement of
fact?  What are they not 'losing' nor 'gaining'?  If I trade my skill
for yours, I feel I have won something, since otherwise I would have had
to spend years training at said skill.  This is the inherient value of
money, it is a representation of man-hours worked or intellegint human
effort.  You seem to imply absolutely that no one loses or gains, while
I feel I do win out, and so does the other party.  If the other party
agrees, are you stating that we are both wrong and just diluded?  Or is
your 'niether loses or gains' statement purely an opinion?

You did not answer the question.  Is their a limit to value that
technology produces?  

And why is freedom the ability to determine the *value* of your time,
and not just what to *do* with your time?

If you say "Ill give you a dollar for that loaf of bread" and I might do
it or might not, perhaps I consider my effort put into that loaf of
bread as worth more than a dollar.  I did, after all, grow the wheat,
grind thr flour, raise the cows for the milk, mix the concoction, and
the burn the coal required to heat it up.  You think Ill sell that for a
dollar?

This is the fundamental contradiction in your stance, you state both at
the same time that "each person should be able to determine the value of
their own time" and in the next statement...

Which is it, is value determined by the effort, or by how much person
thinks is own time is worth?  How are you measuring 'value'? (hence my
comments on calories expended)

Additionally, should I give you a dollar for your guitar playing, you
still do not consider yourself to have 'won' nor 'loss'  You have a
dollar where before you did not.  What if a million people gave you a
dollar to all hear you play your guitar for a minute.  What did you
lose?  A few calories moving those fingers around perhaps, but you
gained 1 million dollars.  Conversely, your audience each lost one
dollar, but they also got to hear some good classical guitar music
(hopefully) which some have though may have been barely worth a dollar,
but other may have been willing to pay five dollars, or ten, to hear the
sounds produced by your wiggling fingers on a piece of wood with some
strings.  Did they not 'win' out also?

Did you say 'worth' paying for?  But I thought you didn't win out?
Seems like, for a mere $8.95 you are paying someone else to raise smelly
pigs, the corn to feed them, a farm full of letuce, a farm of tomato,
the fertilizer and the equipment to cultivate those, and bread (maybe
some mayo) Yet the cost of this effort just happens to coincide exactly
with what you would pay for it as an even exchange?  If you think $9 is
to high, what if it was $.9 dollars?  Maybe you were willing to pay $2,
but can get it for less than one.  Is there still no 'winner' or 'loser'
Maybe that grocer would have still made extra money if they sold it for
50cents, but they got almost a buck out of you.  They are happier than
they were before, and you would have paid twice as much, so you are
happier.  Is this not a non-zero sum interaction!?

Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.  And why do you call this
'peacefull' anarchy exactly?  And how is this any better than the
current post-industrialize west system?  Do you not think a local
warlord pointing a gun at your face to take some of your food you grew
on your farm is 'alienation of labor'?  I don't exactly want to maintain
an arsenal, can I pay someone else to do it and ensure no one threatens
me with their aresenal?  Isnt that, in a way, what I am all ready doing
with my taxes?  After all, if someone comes up to me with a gun, I call
those people I pay, and they are hear to drag off the gun toting nut and
keep him, basically, from f-ing with me.

That's fine, but what if the system you are proposing is worse.  And it
kills millions of people.  What if the system you are rallying most
against is what will bring the world to the closest it can possibly get
to an ideal world free of force?  How are you determining, objectively,
what is the best way to persue such a goal.  How are you determining,
objectively, that your goal will indeed be better, and it wont kill most
of its inhabitants.  I am sure Pol Pot thought his goals laudable, but
1/3rd of the Cambodia population paid the price with their phsyical
lives, and the rest paid with their emotional lives.  It seems like you
are just doing a lot of complaining, without looking at the consequences
of your suggestions.  It also sounds like you are more like a social
anarchist then a 'peaceful anarchist'

So we do have property rights then?  Well, what if I want more property
than you think I should have?  Is that when we whip out the big guns and
enforce that 'peacefull anarachy'?  I said there is plenty of water and
food, not land.  I do feel there is plenty of land, but there are more
and more restrictions on land use, this issue of reason magazine relays
that the number of regulations on land has increased 80% in the last
decade.  Some cities and towns in the US have regulations on what
structures must *look* like.  This and many other factors contribute to
the increase in the cost of land.  But the population growth rates are
slowing as the world industrializes, most post industrial nations have
zero or less than zero birth rates, and as societies get wealthier and
more concerned with individualistic goals, that trend will only
accelerate.  

But regardless, there may be plenty of food and water, but since we all
have property rights, what if I buy up most of the food production land
and charge what I want for the food.  Does a gang of 'peacefull
anarchists' come beating down my fences with machine guns and iron bars?
You acknowledge that some people will not want to farm (I certainly do
not) perhaps they'll sell their arable land to me, and I'll form a large
industrialized agrictultural base, then sell the food back to them.
They will be free from the labor of farming, and I'll be free from the
labor of building cars, houses, telephones, etc etc etc.  

Um, how is this any different then the current market based system?

And if they do not recognize the value of what they achieved, what then?
Is it not worth keeping.  What if others recognize the value, but the

continue to consume.

And what if I do not share with them?  As I said, it's a hard winter
coming up, and I prepared for it.  They wasted away their productive
summer nights drinking and playing cards at the saloon.  This winter,
they stand to starve or freeze, I and my family will do neither.
However, should we divide up my provisions, perhaps some 50% of them
would not starve or freeze, but 50% of my family would.  What is the
'right thing to do'?

Maybe, maybe he is sick of performing brain operations.  Or maybe he
only became a doctor because his dad wanted him to, and now that he can
survive without have to perform brain surgeries, he is perfectly content
to sculpt clay instead of perform operations.  What then?

The more something is valued by more people, the higher people are paid
to perform that service, and the more likely people are to perform that
service.  

I do not understand how you could say something like the above, yet
previously say:

>>If you say "I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour."
>>
>>I might do it, I might not.  Depends on how I feel, if I'm free, etc.

And not realize the contradiction.  How about 'I'll give you a dollar to
perform that brain surgery' He might do it, he might not.  Depends on
how he feels, right?  He's free, after all.  Of course, I'll die, but he
is free!  You also say "Each person should be able to determine the
value of their own time" Perhaps the good doctor feels his time is
valued at 1 million dollars per second of operation time.  He is, after
all, free to determine the value of his time, is he not?

>He should help you.  The Government isn't exactly helping right now.

But what if he does not want to help me?  I hear lots of 'shoulds' and
'it's the right thing to do' but no concrete answers to problems.  And
Sure the government is helping, we have no shortage of brain surgeons.
The system, kept in place (for the most part) by governments, helps to
ensure that money is a representation of effort or man-hours worked and
has value, that no one with a big gun will hold you up and take all your
bread, and that worth is determined by the consumer and the producer in
competition, yet both benefit.  You insit that worth should be
determined solely by the producer E.g. "Each person should be able to
determine the value of their own time" and seem to suggest that value as
determined by an interaction of consumer and producer leads both to be
'unfree'

Ah, so if he charges more than people are willing to pay, he will go out
of business!!!  Robbie, how is this *any* different than a market based
capitalism?  Your statement above directly contradicts the idea of
determining the value of your own time freely.  The two can not
co-exist.  They are a logical contradiction, you can not have A and
not-A simaltaneously.  Either he determines the value of his time, or
all the parties involved determine the value (the producers and the
consumers)

And what if I did not?  A significant majority of the population does
not 'plan well enough' for such things, yet society generally expects
them to receive the same 'adequate' health care that others who do plan
well enough receive.  Who forces the Doctor to perform the operation
when there is no government that collects taxes or insists employers
give employees health benefits if working full time, in effect forcing
the masses, despite their stupidity, to prepare for such things.

The system you propose is basically what we have in place in most post

minarchist liberterians generally object to (drug war, subsidies,
intereference of business by government, etc)  Seems you should just be
a minarchist libertarian, and move to new hampshire with the rest of us
in a year or two.

'THIS' isnt perfect, but it's the best thing we have seen so far, and I
fear your sytem would be far far worse.

In what cases to people not benefit from their labor?  The only case I
can think of is when people are not granted the fruits of their labor,
i.e. slavery.  Which doesn't exist anywhere anymore.  What if people
want to all sell their land because they don't want to farm, and buy
land on the water?  There is only so much land on the water, what if
everyone wants to move there?

But isnt being forced to charge a 'reasonable' fee, as in the case of
our Doctor, a form of coercion?  Isnt that why you consider it not being
free, and why you use the qualifier of "Each person should be able to
determine the value of their own time" instead of "each person should be
able to determine what to *do* with their time"  If I am forced to
charge less than what I think my services are worth, I am still
FORCED!!!  In the first possible example I give you of where someone
values his time differently than what others value you, you assert that
the value should be a reasonable interaction of those, this is exactly
what the supply and demand curves determine.  Pick up any intro to
business book, and replace 'supply' with 'how much one values his own
time' and replace 'demand' with 'how much others value your time' and
youll see the same thing.

So you play the guitar, and I bring over some tomatoes?  Isnt that a

your guitar.    Is it just the concept of money you don't like?

really well, and I think it has a lot of value.  I do, after all, get to
determine the value of my own time.

of the people?

But it isnt, since Australia's economy is not run by the will of one
individual who has absolute power.  The Khmer rouge executed anyone with
money, glasses, ability to speak multiple languages, doctors, etc. etc.
I suggest you read the Democide page's article on cambodia
http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM 

"In proportion to its population, Cambodia underwent a human catastrophe
unequaled by any other country in the twentieth century (see Figure 1.2
of my Death By Government). It probably lost slightly less than
4,000,000 people to war, rebellion, manufactured famine, and
democide--genocide, nonjudicial executions, and massacres--or close to
56 percent of its 1970 population. Between 1970 and 1980, from democide
alone, successive governments and guerrilla groups murdered almost
3,300,000 men, women, and children, including 35,000 foreigners. Most of
these, probably as many as 2,400,000, were murdered by the communist
Khmer Rouge, both before and (to a much greater extent) when they took
over Cambodia after April 1975"

Over-eating is a far larger cause of Heart Disease, and people over eat
because food is so damn cheap and consumer goods so inexpensive, leading
us to live more sedantary lives than ever before.  Plenty of people work
with No stress also, work does not absolutely cause stress.

As Damien has addressed this, I'll pass.  But suffuce to say, in this
example your hunch is entirely wrong.  The most predominant cause of
cancer is diet, which is again because food is so damn cheap.  And of
course, these killers are only killers in the post industrial west,
someone in Burma, for example, could only hope to worry about dying from
cancer, since they'll never get enough food or live to old age to worry
about it.

This sort of thing used to be weird to me, until I noticed a pattern.
One cannot end one's own life legally.  One cannot modify one's own brain
or body chemistry without formal permission from the state.  One cannot
legally sell the sexual services of one's body to another private party
(except in narrow and, again, state-approved circumstances).

It boils down to the simple fact that the state considers the biological
bodies of its citizens to be its property.  You don't own your body or
brain, as far as (as far as I know) any modern state-entity (of which
you might be a citizen) is concerned.

This seems nonsensical to me.  "When I suggest the abolition of an
entire class of crimes, I don't mean that every crime in the class should
be abolished."  I don't understand.

Huh, that's interesting.  The problem that I see is that negotiating
limitations of liability on a per-relationship or, worse, situational
basis would make a market economy logistically prohibitive.  There has
to be some body of consensus about what patterns liability limitations
generally fall into, so that one can pull the appropriate boilerplate
language on cue and move directly into a transaction.  State and federal
contract and corporate law seems to be our current best stab at this.
Most suggestions that I hear libertarian-types make for any systems to
supplant this seem pretty laughable.

The subject is liability limitation, not liability removal.  Right?

And it seems like a fairly simple and obvious fact that, while it would be
NICE if we lived in a universe where everyone had the luxury of sufficient
time, knowledge, and mental capacity to evaluate all of their risk in
any investment or other situation, we don't, and we're never going to.
In order for there to be any non-institutional investment on any wide
scale, there has to be some repository of trust, however cobbled together.

Again, I think this will lead to an established set of generally accepted
liability-limitation formulas, which is essentially what we have now.
When you see that my company's name is Brendan Coffey's Spiffy Con Job, LLC,
you know a great deal about what liability I (contractually) accept and refuse.

If you don't like LLCs, don't do business with one.  I don't see that the
system you're (vaguely) describing would be functionally different.

So, how do you feel that LLC is different from a subchapter S or C

be abolished?

Straw man.  He said he was for anarchy; your question implies a State
(the local warlord), in a way that suggests you think that is really
what he wants.

Personally, I regard the State as nothing more than very successful
criminals.  Therefore, we don't have a perfectly peaceful anarchy as
long as there is anyone performing functions similar to the State
(murder, theft, kidnapping, etc).  Nevertheless, I am sure that it's
possible to get closer than we are.

No, it isn't.  If it were, you wouldn't notice them unless they were
actively protecting you right now.  In fact, practically everything
you do is altered by the State.  Further, you'd be able to stop paying
in exchange for cessation of services.  If you did stop, however, you'd
risk being kidnapped, or murdered if you resisted kidnapping very
effectively.

Have you tried that? :)  In practice, what they do is exact revenge on
those who f-ed with you. Once in a while.  If they find them.  To make
it clearer that protection is not the goal, they make it difficult to
protect yourself, too.   Even if they successfully exact revenge upon
your attacker, however, it won't help *you*.

That's pretty surprising.  In fact, it seems that an even more surprising
fact is true: the probability of a white chip on every round j is always
3/8, the same as it is on round 1.  And the probability of white chips
on both of any two different rounds j and k is always 1/6.  From this,
Eliezer's formula follows, as p(Wj|Wk) = p(Wj&Wk)/p(Wk) = 1/6  /  3/8 = 4/9.

I can prove at least the first statement, that the probability is always
the same on every round.  Suppose on round N there are p white chips and
q chips total.  Then the probability of drawing white on that round is
p/q.

Now consider round N+1.  If we drew white on round N (which happened with
probability p/q), the probability of white on this round is (p+1)/(q+1).
If we drew red on round N (which happened with probability (q-p)/q),
the probability of white on this round is p/(q+1).

So the total probability of white on this round is the sum of these two
values, weighted by their probabilities, or p/q * (p+1)/(q+1)
+ (q-p)/q * p/(q+1).

= (p^2 + p + qp - p^2) / q(q+1)

= p(q+1) / q(q+1)

= p / q

QED.

I imagine a more complex proof could show that the probability of white
on both of any two rounds is constant, and presumably this could be
generalized to any n rounds.  But I don't see how to prove all this
in a simple way.

What I mean is that, as I'd prefer that no State exist, there can
hardly be crimes against the State, though specific things that are
considered crimes against the State under our present legal systems
might still be criminal (murder, to use the example used before).

I'm just saying that the fact that States appropriate murder as a
"crime against the State" does not indicate that in a world without
States, murder wouldn't be a crime.

What?  Trying to negotiate a limitation of liability seems like a
bald statement that you intend to employ force or fraud.  I agree
that if many people attempted to get out of responsibility for
their actions before every transaction, you wouldn't have much of
a market.  It hardly seems that the proper solution is to exempt
entire classes of people from the consequences of their actions,
however!

I agree that there would likely be a basic legal framework that nearly
everyone uses for market transactions.  I don't expect that framework
to include consequence-free fraud, however.

More to the point, the more worrying problems are limited liability
with respect to people not engaged directly in a transaction with the
company.  If a factory's pipes leak chemicals into groundwater that
maim the neighborhood children, the owners of the company should not
be protected from the liability of the company for the situation.

Negotiation of limited liability doesn't even apply here; the people
in the area may have had no market transactions with the factory
that would prompt them to enter a contract, so the only way that
limited liability would apply is by State fiat.

The "limited liability company" limits liability to the assets which are
owned through the company, but not other assets of the owners of the
company.

If you have an accident, you're expected to pay the costs to others
of that accident (and probably have insurance for that).  If a limited
liability company has an accident, the owners are not expected to pay
the costs if those costs exceed the value of the company.  So it isn't
that liability is limited for the company; it's that the company is a
way to remove liability from the owners of their own actions.

Rafal was saying, if I understand correctly, that the way to fix the
obvious problem of the owners not being liable is to legally require
the company to have insurance, so that the value of the company isn't
a limit to the possible damages.  This seems like a kludge to me,
because it leads to more intervention.  In a few years, someone will
notice that insurance rates are higher every year, since the insurance
companies have a captive market.  So let's put a cap on insurance rates
to fix the new problem!  But them someone has to decide what that cap
should be, and if they fail to predict what the level would have been
in a free market for insurance, the difference will cause other 
problems.

It just doesn't end.  You can patch these problems in every legislative
session, or you can remove the root cause.  If you remove all the root
causes, you'll have a free market, and anarchy.

While people doing business with you are more likely to be affected

I'm not up on the liability of owners of S corps, but C corps are
certainly limited liability companies, so everything I've been saying
applies.

If two or more people want to jointly own a venture, that's their
business, and their own problem to work out the details.  When something
happens to cause that venture to acquire debt, however, I expect that
debt to be paid, and if necessary, I expect the owners to cough up the
value to set things right.  The only exception I'll make is if the terms
of the debt itself state that only company assets can be used to pay the
debt.

This has probably been very boring for most people on this list,
but I hope I answered your questions about my opinion.  :)

There is a real axiomatic difference between collectivists and 
individualists, and it's likely to persist indefinitely. This reminds me 
of a cellular automaton experiment (Forgot the reference, anybody 
remember? It was in Science) where they found that neither strategy 
consistantly "wins" in the simulation... the "winning" side depends upon 
starting conditions, is hard to predict, and often the simulation just 
keeps on going in a perpetual state of flux between the two rival 
strategies.

I think that's what the debate between individualists and collectivists 
is like, and I think it will last throught the next *several* singularities.

That being said, the collectivist side in *this* particular thread may 
do well to read up on game theory. You will never convince anybody who 
doesn't agree with you to begin with if you proceed on the demonstrably 
false assumption that everything is a zero sum game.

I'm deliberately not naming names to avoid a defensive reaction. Simply, 
within the privacy of your own brain, if the terms "positive sum game" 
and "zero sum game" are kind of vague, then google them and read up on 
them. I might do the googling myself and post the links later if I have 
time.

Also, it looks like there's a terminological disagreement over the term 
'value'. Some people hold the axiom that value stems from the labor put 
into a product (value to the seller) and some hold the axiom that value 
stems from the usefulness of a product (value to the buyer). This can be 
completely sidestepped by instead talking about 'price', and that might 
be what you mean in the first place anyway. If we're talking about 
price, then it's determined simply by what gets exchanged for what. In a 
pure command economy it's determined by the governing body. In a pure 
market economy it's determined by the market. Usually it's a mix of 
both. Price objective, value subjective.

Sorry if I'm stating the obvious.

Religion and culture are surely red herrings when looking for an
explanation of varying economic output. I don't own anything made in
Africa... and what do you conclude from the ubiquity of the phrase "Made
in China"? Communism is good for increasing manufacturing output? No
offense to economists, but I think our understanding of economics is
about on par with our understanding of AI, or any other complex system.

It is a good point. I suspect it's ultimately down to what i raised in a
different thread, ie the family system. SE Asia has a radically different
kind of family system to the rest of the Islamic world ie Middle East,
Central Asia, North Africa, Northwest Indian Sub-Continent. SD

This is based on Karl Schroeder's _Permancence_. Some idea spoilers:

Schroeder's argument is based on that it is the ability to change the 
environment and ourselves that is the problem. Intelligence arises, he 
suggests, because a species has no particular adaptations making it 
suided for the environment it finds itself in. So instead it develops 
intelligence enabling it to at first succeed better in the environment 
and then to change the environment to suit itself - first locally, the  
globally as it becomes more powerful. Eventually it becomes able to 
change environments and itself in arbitrary ways. It is at this point it 
will remove all discrepancy between itself and its environment. The 
species is perfectly adapted to its world, and there is no pressure for 
more intelligence. In fact, as long as the now artificial environment 
and the species change together they can "devolve" quietly into a 
non-intelligent form, which is the ultimately stable state.

Schroeder's argument is a long-range argument. In his novel he mentions 
that several species appears to have built galaxy-spanning empires and 
gone post-alien in the past, but eventually (sometimes after fairly long 
periods) all ended up in the above non-intelligent state. His point is 
that over truly long spans of time it might be nearly impossible for 
civilizations to escape this kind of evolutionary attractors. In his 
novel there are two species that have tried, with some mixed success. 
One is called the Chicxulub...

I personally don't think his argument is true, but it is interesting. It 
leaves out the fact that a diverse civilization will always have some 
individuals creating offshoots even if the main trunk is fossilizing, 
and it ignores that the social environment created by other people is 
far more complex than any natural environment and co-evolves strongly 
with the species. I don't think "will to live" works as an argument, 
though. 

BTW, Schroeder has some interesting criticism of the singularity and new
worldtypes on his blog http://www.kschroeder.com/ - there are some
interesting ideas there.

_Permanence_ has a somewhat similar situation; there it seems clear that
the universe is in a long-term steady state situation (either a real
steady state or chaotic inflation, I forget which) and that intelligence
does not last. So what motivates people to do longterm stuff? I think
the answer for the protagonist is a bit simplistic, essentially
Nietzsche's dictum that one should live every moment to the fullest
since it will recur an infinite number of times, but that might serve to
amplify a long-term ambition (I love doing long-term stuff, hence I
should be doing it). 

I think a real answer to your question would be more diverse. Different 
people and species will have different answers. The idea that something 
that ultimately ends thus is pointless is a culturally particular 
construction. One can easily imagine cultures that see something good in 
finitude, for example. And again, if a species is relatively diverse 
there will be individuals with sufficiently unusual ideas to go on.

This actually undermines the anti-colonization argument, since there
would always be a few individuals of each supercivilization (and that
can be quite a few) that would consider running away and starting their
own new civilization to be great. That would produce a new wave of 
civilizations, that in turn would produce daughters. The Robins scenario 
would start.

Huh? Neural networks can become overtrained if they are too large and 
get too little data - they learn each individual piece of data but does 
not generalize them to intermediary values. Attractor neural networks 
can also suffer from catastrophic forgetting: they can store a finite 
amount of information, but if they are trained with more they forget 
everything and become useless, unable to either learn or retrieve. The 
"solution" is to make them forgetful, so that they forget old or 
irrelevant information, or make them extend themselves with new neurons 
as needed.

Looking at your post, your thrust seem to be that our civilization is 
getting too rigid, locked into non-adaptable patterns. A bit like 
catastrophic forgetting: we have filled our potential of complexity, and 
adding anything more will break the patterns. I think this is an overly 
pessimistic view. I rather think the situation is like selforganised 
criticality. Whenever things get too rigid and blocked, they build up 
pressure and eventually break. The result is a state of dynamic 
equilibrium where large and small changes occurs. Sometimes this results 
in dramatic and painful cascades, sometimes in minor disturbances. The 
small disturbances are far more common than the big ones and serve to 
prevent them (typical examples are brushfires, which prevent larger 
forest fires). Maybe the real threat would be if a global civilization 
manages to hold off such changes too long - the pressure builds up, and 
when the shift comes it hurts a lot of people. That's why I'm happy 
there are still mongolian horsemen on the Asian steppes - they are a 
valuable backup.

> Can anyone provide a reference for the estimated cost of

"It isn't clear to me what report you are referencing (in 
the
future it might be nice to post a URL)..."

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=mars+reference+mission+site%3Anasa.gov&btnG=Google+Search
:-)

Seriously, I meant the "Human Exploration of Mars: The 
Reference Mission of the NASA Mars Exploration Study 
Team", which lies at this URL.

http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/mars/reference/hem/hem1.html


"But Zubrin, in Chapter 3 on pgs 46/47 of "The Case for 
Mars"
documents the "90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the 
Moon and
Mars", otherwise known as "The 90-Day Report".

He says, "The 90-Day Report did not include a published 
cost
estimate; however cost estimates for the program were 
generated
that were eventually leaked to the press.  The bottom 
line:
$450 Billion.""

It seems to me this figure came from the upper end of 
estimates given for the  first Bush administration's Space 
Exploration Initiative, later re-named Human Exploration 
Initiative.

"How accurate this is, I don't know."

Given Zubrin's general enthusiasm, and his seeming disdain 
for NASA, that $50 billion number might overstate the 
case. However, Zubrin's "Entering Space" on page 104 gives 
$50 billion for this mission.

Rather than toss out possibly better ways to spend money 
on paper spacecraft (Saturn V, Shuttle-C, ORION, space 
elevator), I'd like to point out that Bush's recent $87 
billion request for additional funds would pay for going 
to Mars even on a cost-plus basis.

Robbie and Rafal... you are slinging the term 'morality' back and forth 
unexamined as if it's an objective concept you both agree on and merely 
disagree on the details of implementation. I recently posted something 
on the Genomics Yahoogroup that has just become relevant here...

----------
One of the problems plaguing the field of ethics is a pair of 
contradictory assumptions at its very core:

"Some things are right and some things are wrong, and we need to know 
the difference."

"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion."

I propose that ethics should be redefined as...

"An ontology for clearly stating what your particular system of axioms 
is, coming to logical conclusions/decisions based on these axioms, and 
communicating your axioms and your process of reasoning based on them to 
others."

Here's an example of how this more honest and rigorous approach to 
ethics would work:

Bob is a Christian. Bob states his axioms.

"I hold the following beliefs to be axiomatic-- God exists, and the 
Bible expresses God's will. In places where the Bible is not clear, the 
literal interpretation is to favored."

Bob then states his conclusions.

"Based on what is written in the Bible, killing humans is wrong, unborn 
fetuses are human, and therefore abortion is wrong."

Jane is a secular humanist. Jane does not share Bob's axioms, but 
aknowledges that they are axioms and not directly subject to debate. She 
can do the following, though...

a) She can point out contradictions within Bob's chosen set of axioms, 
forcing him to assign priorities to the various axioms he holds.

b) She can challenge the chain of reasoning leading from Bob's axioms 
(the Bible expresses God's will) to Bob's conclusions (abortion is wrong).

c) If the above approaches both fail, Jane and Bob can agree to disagree.

Note that in the event of c), this disagreement isn't always peaceful, 
unfortunately. As an extreme example, if Bob's axioms were to explicitly 
include the statement "Blow up abortion clinics" and Jane was an 
owner/employee/customer of an abortion clinic, then Bob and Jane will 
inevitably find themselves in conflict at whatever level permitted by 
the society they exist in and their level of commitment to their 
respective axioms. But at least Bob, Jane, and any bystanders would have 
a clear idea of what specifically the conflict was about... and whether 
or not the underlying issue has been resolved, voiding the conflict. For 
example, if safe and inexpensive removal/storage/transplantation of 
embryos became possible, Bob and Jane would no longer have reason to 
quarrel-- after all, Bob never stated that "Sex without intent to 
procreate is wrong" and Jane never stated that "fetuses must be killed".

Instead of this, ethics debates today seem to rely on appeal to 
authority and some kind of imaginary universal concept of right and 
wrong. It's FRAUDULENT to use value-implying terms without first clearly 
identifying your values so your audience can make up their own minds as 
to whether your idea of "right", "good", "natural", and "humane" 
corresponds to their own. The approach I've outlined above will help 
expose individuals who are trying to conceal their own agenda underneath 
some kind of blanket "consensus" or "prevailing social norms".

There should be something equivalent to Godwin's Law that gets triggered 
when someone talks about 'morality' without saying exactly what that 
word signifies to them.

PS: The original purpose of this thread was to figure out how not to get 
the crack-pot treatment from fellow scientists at a vulnerable, early 
point in our careers. But what the heck, ethics is an interesting and 
important topic too.

Evil Hint #3:

The classical version of the problem has a bowl where we sample without 
replacement - take the chip, and throw it away.  Suppose there are M red 
chips and N chips.  If you don't know what you got on the first round, the 
probability of getting a red chip on the second round is still M/N.  The 
probability of getting a red chip on the second round, given that you got 
a red chip on the fourth round, is just (M-1)/(N-1), since there's one 
less red chip to go around.  We can think of sprinkling the chips over 
holes, instead of drawing them in successive rounds, and it doesn't matter 
if you swap around the labels on the holes.

The evil version of the bowl, instead of running out of the chips already 
sprinkled, has more and more of them, like a P2P file-sharing network. 
But that doesn't change anything important.

Both of them are losing exactly 1 hour each.  Two hours total.   That's 
the objective facts of it.  The subjective fact "Did they enjoy their 
hour" is well, subjective, not to say arbitrary, but certainly 
negotiable.

A person can learn to love even the most awkward drudgery.

Not if you give up something of equal value - your 1 hour.  You may 
have the subjective feeling of "pheew" but you haven't actually gained 
anything, you've lost your hour.  It was an hour very efficiently 
spent, but still an hour of your life, gone, dusted, forever lost to 
memory and wistfulness, spent performing menial labor, something you've 
done a thousand times before.

MAYBE it would be more fun and interesting to learn other people's 
trades?  That is a subjective factor.  You can spend your time how you 
like.  But you can never gain any more of it, and it is that TIME that 
is valuable to You, Me and your cohorts.  That's why you're willing to 
make the trade - you can save some time by spending some time.

But the fact is, you didn't actually save time, you only spent it.  So 
did your other person.

Consider the possibility that you didn't NEED their help.  Consider the 
possibility that even though it would take you YEARS to get as good at 
doing what they're doing that those years might be a lot of fun!  Even 
Pig-Farming can be fun.

Perhaps a better way of putting it is that money can be artificially 
inflated so that the people who print money and control the money 
supply can always maintain an upper-hand in monetary exchanges, making 
the value of money arbitrary - that is, it is the main value of money

Sure, you've got what you wanted, he got what he wanted.  On the other 
hand, you had to do something you (let's assume) didn't want to do and 
so did he.  The exchange, has no net creation of time.

It's a statement about what is valuable in exchanges.  The answer is 
human effort, time.  Of course there are subjective factors that say 
whether or not your "time is well spent" but the objective factor is 
the simple expense of your human labor doing something for someone else.

the question is badly formed.  If there were a machine that could 
convert solar energy to hamburgers, that machine would be really, 
really great to have.  It's value, however, would be determined by how 
hard it would be for me to acquire it and/or the hamburgers it creates. 
  That would be determined by the amount of effort I had to put in to 
get them.

> And why is freedom the ability to determine the *value* of your time,
> and not just what to *do* with your time?

Because if I am free, I can charge $3000/hr for my time.  If I am not, 
I can be forced to do something for less.

The cases are exactly parallel - the bread and the guitar-playing.

By the subjective factor by which a person values their own time.  No 
dichotomy here.

Depends on what I have to play.  If I have to play "Come Mr. Tally-man 
Tally-me-bannana" I (may have) lost my self-respect and my minute.

On the other hand if I just plain WANTED to play what I happened to be 
playing and someone wanted to give me money for it, we still have a 
zero-sum, to use your terminology.  Money is of variable value.  If 
people are making "average" guitar-players millionaires in 1-minute, 
then a million dollars isn't worth that much, is it?

>  Did they not 'win' out also?

Again, if they do it "OF THEIR OWN WILL" that is, if they do it for 
themselves, then sure, they have spent their time the way they wanted 
to, they're free, they win - they simply did what they wanted with 
their time.

Maybe I did too.  But the objective factor - how much time  - we both 
lost exactly the same amount.  Tick Tick Tick.

Well, I for one know that in 1991 I could get a nice BLT in westwood 
for $5.95.  Now it's $8.95.  That's not cheaper.  What standard are you 
using for "cheaper".  Even by my standard - time - I still have to walk 
over to the restaurant, sit down, ask.  That person has to go order, 
get, have made and bring it to me.  You can see why I prefer to measure 
by time - it manages to transcend epochal and cultural distinctions of 
value ( but not religious or moral distinctions of value - the 
Religious or Ethical person doesn't care how long it takes to do the 
right thing.)

> Did you say 'worth' paying for?  But I thought you didn't win out?

I said there was a tie - we both lose the exact same amount of the only 
thing worthwhile - the TIME.

>  Is this not a non-zero sum interaction!?

You can see that there's a hole in the zero-sum theory then.  What if 
all transactions "objectively" have a net-creation of nothing?  What 
if, for instance, the laws of physics apply to economics too, and no 
matter what you do, no matter or energy or time or space is created or 
destroyed in any transaction?

I would put it this way as in other things.  There is an hierarchy of 
goods:

Physical Needs
Physical Wants
Pleasures
Mediate Happiness
Temporal Fulfillment
Ethical Fulfillment
Honor
Glory

At the level of the physical are the "objective" transactions of simple 
Time.
At the level of Honor and Glory are Good Uses of Time.

But these will have very little to do with economics.

> Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.

No, whoever is smart enough to stay away from people with big guns wins 
out.

> And why do you call this
> 'peacefull' anarchy exactly?

Well, let's say you KNOW I have a really, really big gun.  And let's 
say you think you have a bigger one.  There's still the risk that your 
bigger gun will not be effective in beating me to the draw and you may 
die.  It will, therefore, be reasonable for you to seek cooperation 
rather than competition with me UNLESS your gun is SOOO BIG that I 
can't possibly win (like our Iraq war), in which case if you are a mean 
person, you may attack.

In fact, this is roughly what has happened, the Military Industrial 
Complex of Capitalism has attacked and you have lost.  Tough cookies.  
You're a tax-paying slave to whoever they decide to put in the 
government.

Alternatively, you can go around killing people and fighting both your 
current and potential enemies.  We'll call this version of "peaceful 
anarchy" the peace of Death.

> And how is this any better than the

Its more honest and more local and more manageable.  Clearly I'm 
suggesting that the current power structures be dismantled.  Why?  
Because they (the people who collect and manage the 50-70% of your 
income that goes to the government in a variety of taxes charges and 
tariffs) managed to gain such an advantage over us non-combatants that 
we're helpless before them.  It's sad and a little scary.  DO YOU like 
the fact that GW can drop bombs and call in the CIA to get you, but you 
can't, and that there are parallels to George Bush calling out hits on 
the David Kelly's of the world?

Without the network to support their power structure and without the 
ideology to support the network, those kinds of things, I believe, 
would just be a thing of the past.

Definitely.  I doubt he'd do that if we were on roughly equal 
"military" footing.  Military footing is gained, once again, by the 
aggregation of human effort and labor.  This is harder without the 
underlying structures of power that are already in place (eg money, 
"free markets", etc.)

That's your CHOICE.  I don't personally trust the police very much.  I 
would like to have alternatives.  Isn't that the core of 
Libertarianism.  We should have competing police.

If someone comes up to you with a gun with the intent to kill you RIGHT 
NOW, you're probably dead.  The US police are reactive and exist 
primarily to protect the property rights of the wealthy.    Call murder 
in Watts, get no response.  Call Insurance Claim in Beverly Hills, get 
two patrol cars.

Doubtful.  Any reason to expect that it is?  Plenty of genocides year

elements in human lives.

Say you've got a burning coal on your hand.  It hurts.  You may 
conjecture "Well, my hand may hurt more if I take it out" since you 
just don't know.  So you leave it there.  "Better the devil you know,

Well, I have some concrete suggestions that might tend to make the US

compromises that might make the country less terrifyingly dangerous and 
evil, but that's all.

Maybe.  I don't like pigeonholing myself.  I did it because it was

of me as a "social anarchist" then fine.

Rights are negative.  I don't have a right to take something from you, 
so you therefore have the right to posses what you posses.  What will

well, if you were to try to set up a "New STATE" obviously we'd have to

I'll assume that the people who are living without taxes will not want

then they'd be free to change it.  As opposed to NOW when it's nearly

The point of a free society is that it would have to be free - that is 
- changeable.

some people do things because the LIKE to.    Some Doctors genuinely 
like saving other people's lives.  Those are the people we'd LIKE to 
have for doctors as opposed to the ones that just LIKE to make money.  
When money subordinates the health-care profession, you get systems 
like those in the US where the very wealthy get very good care and the 
poor and middle class get only emergency care.

and you are free not to pay him, go use some other doctor.  No 
difference from today's world, the difference is that the Government 
isn't propping up the cost of medical care in our future dream-world.  
Doctor's have to eat too, you know.

Well, if the supply and demand theory is true, there is a shortage of 
brain surgeons - that's why they make so much money.

Actually the system that is in place PRE-STEALS your bread and prevents 
other people from doing so IF the target is wealthy.   It also has a 
nice habit of changing the value of money occasionally as 
necessary/convenient.

No, it's the 3rd party that I'm complaining about.  You seem to be 
insisting that there be SOME power structure in place that would FORCE 
a doctor to treat you NO MATTER WHAT.

Well, tough patooties.  That system doesn't exist now, nor do I think 
it would be ideal, for the system that would force doctors to fix you 
might also force them to be slaves.  Is that what you want? Slavery?

That's right, they shouldn't be FORCED by some third party to make 
arbitrary exchanges.  If you can't FORCE me to do something, then I do 
it because I WANT to.

In our world, all people are effectively forced to pay taxes and that 
drives "most" of them to take shitty jobs.

Only trust people as far as you can throw them, especially insurers.

Probably.  But the existence of drug wars, subsidies, business 
interference in governement and vice versa make up the main problems as 
I see them.  That's what makes the freedom impossible - the underlying 
material conditions of advanced societies.

Fear is the mind killer.  Like I said, the devil you know is worse than

Yes, time will tell.  The matter will be settled after a few hundred

the evidence so far is that they don't become egalitarian in less than

years.  BUT if your proposition is wait 2000 years, I'm willing to wait 
and be agnostic about this "futurism" question.

Which supply and demand curves , the "with military-money backing" or 
the "without military-money backing".

Try this one on for size, there is no "supply and demand curve" any 
more than there are "recessions".  It's words, mumbo jumbo used to give 
ease of conceptualization to almost impossibly complex phenomena.

> Is it just the concept of money you don't like?

Force-backed money.

If I'm willing to take paper in exchange for tomatoes, that should be 
my choice.

In the united states, it's illegal to take alternate forms of money.  
In fact, in almost every country, they INSIST that you carry on 
commerce in their form of money - the penalties for setting up 
alternative money schemes are pretty severe.  That's called FORCED.

Oy vey, if Australia's government supports either directly or

Maybe.  Maybe they overeat because they're so stressed out and 
over-commercialized and have absolutely nothing better to do because 
they're trapped working in shitty jobs paying of large mortgages.  
Perhaps our societies actually have a psychological effect on the 
people.

Sure, and plenty of people work with stress.  I'll get stats, but I'm

Isn't that one of the basics of physics nowadays?

Look at the epidemiology. Of course we know some pollutants (mutagens) are
carcinogenic. It was known in 1775 that British men who'd worked as chimney
sweeps were prey to scrotal cancer. In Japan, bathing lowered the
equivalent rates; creosote tars were flushed off the skin. But--

Weinberg notes (in ONE RENEGADE CELL [1999]) that `Except for breast cancer
and tobacco-related cancers, the rates of most kinds of cancers have held
steady over half a century, a time when environmental pollution has
increased substantially.' Age-adjusted, cancer deaths in the USA rose from
143 per 100,000 p.a. in 1930 to 190 per 100,000 and Weinberg notes: `Almost
all of this age-adjusted increase in cancer deaths flows directly from
tobacco consumption' (p. 154).

There is no "may be" about it.   With or without pollutants the cancer rate 
goes up as the average lifespan increases.

Actually, we don't KNOW any such thing in enough detail to imply that is the 
only or primary reason for a higher observed cancer rate.  Cancer can and 
does occur even without any pollutants.

Strawman.  No one said age *causes* cancer.  It is not precise  to say that 
pollution causes cancer either.

Nah. Pinker and other sources indicate that the risk of being murdered in
pre-state cultures is *outrageously* high. An American male has 1 chance in
200 of being murdered (this clearly elides location and sub-culture, but
still). Check out the graph in Pinker's THE BLANK SLATE, chapter 3: the
Jivaro, 60% chance, the Huli a mere 20%.

Granted, those cultures didn't support the capacity to exterminate
*billions* in a spasm war. Luckily.

To a limited extent -- we know that certain pollutants can cause
mutations (this has been worked out extensively by Bruce Ames).
But this can include both pollutants *and* natural substances.
What we don't know is the effect of dose-response relationships.
There is reasonable evidence that exposure to low levels of stresses
or toxic substances might actually up-regulate cell defenses and
decrease the chances of getting cancer.  This process is known as
hormesis.

> We don't KNOW that age does.

Ca-ca.  Cancer rates go up with age whether one lived in Roman
times or the 20th century.

No argument -- except for the hormesis effect I point out above.
This is very variable in the human population -- consider humans
living in a cave (for generations) with high radon levels vs. humans in
a cave with low radon levels.  It would have been very difficult for evolution
to do a complete population optimization for exposure to variable levels
of ionizing radiation (radon is radioactive and decays producing radiation
that is potentially a major source of lung cancer).

Stress causes cancer because it down-regulates the response of the
immune system (see Sapolsky's work).  This is a general misprogramming
of the genome and the shift we have had from a hunter-gatherer societies
to modern societies (which do provide certain benefits like antibiotics).

Pollutants is kind of a genaral term -- certainly some alter gene regulation
pathways in very subtle ways -- such as pollutants that resemble natural
hormones (which seem to be involved in serious consequences to the development
of certain fish and amphibians).  Other pollutants may be completely harmless.

Tobacco and smog are complex problems because they are not specific substances.
Again types of molecules may be harmful but others may be non-harmful or
even beneficial.

Heavy metals can disrupt normal genetic regulatory pathways or the function
of normal protein functions (as was recently determined for cadmium).
They may or may not cause cancer.  Iron and copper can hardly be considered
"heavy" metals but both are ions that if not properly managed can generate
free radicals that *will* damage DNA and lead to cancer.  They are also
essential nutrients -- if not consumed in sufficient quantities one is
highly likely to suffer a premature death.  Ha -- you can beat cancer
by reducing your iron and copper intake -- that way you die before you
get a chance to develop cancer.

Certain "food-poisons", such as Sulforaphane in Broccoli actually have
anti-cancer properties by up-regulating the better pathways of detoxification
in ones liver.

Bottom line (IMO): a big chunk of aging is due to the misrepair of DNA
double strand breaks corrupting the genetic code.  The longer you are around
the more corrupted the code becomes.  Result: increased rates of cancer
and the more general phenomena known as "aging".

This fits in well with oxidative stress, management of cellular glucose
levels (the whole glycemic index thingy), caloric restriction, increases
in mutagenic substances in the environment damaging DNA, exposure to higher
radiation levels (homes with higher radon levels), etc.

Bottom line -- one isn't going to correct the problem until one has robust
bionanotechnology or nanotechnology to correct the repair pathways that
cause the corruption of the genetic code.  The best you may be able to do
in the meantime is retard those processes that contribute to the mutations
and/or double strand breaks.

Well, the CDC and most doctors know this.

Quick quiz:
Which is more likely to cause cancer:
_extended exposure to tar
_being over 95


Which is more likely to cause cancer:
_ Being over 35
_ Being a long-term Smoker over 35

Which is more likely to cause cancer:
_ Exposure to radioactive materials
_ genetic disposition to cancer

Strawman - I said it was tautological that if length of exposure to 
toxic materials is likely to cause cancer than getting older in an 
environment in which there are such materials is ipso facto more likely 
to cause cancer.  This means that age should only be considered a 
factor if there is a control group (lots of old people without cancer). 
  In fact, there is a control group - lots of old people without cancer.

Who said murder?  If I'm interested in developing a "long-term viable 
civilization" I no longer care much about the murder rate.  I care more 
about the war-rate.  We're not afraid of being overrun by the more 
numerous africans because their states are weak.  What if they had 
strong states like ours?  My fear is that people will continue to 
develop ever-stronger states.

Let's put a stop to it now _while we can_.

In Guns, Germs and Steel, Jarod Diamond makes an argument at one point that
"primitive" societies actually select better for intelligence because of,
among other things, the high likelihood of being murdered (and so,
presumably, the usefulness of intelligence in avoiding murder). He posits
that hunter gatherers are probably more intelligent on average than
sedentary 20th city folk, as a result.

I'm not sure if I buy the argument, but hey :-)

I wonder which IQ test that would be, Stanford Binet, Weschler?

In one of Diamond's earlier books, "Rise and Fall of the Third
Chimpanzee", I think, but I don't have it handy, he also postulated
that those groups of people that lived in the coldest, harshest, least
hospitable environments also tended to be smarter.

I guess they didn't *start out* smarter. At least in respect to habitat 
selection :-)

No idea. Possibly the latter, it depends on the dose of the former, probably

There are lots of people exposed to pollutants who don't have cancer, too.

Incorrect, merely existing longer makes you more likely to get cancer,
regardless of pollutants or carcinogens or ionizing radiation.  The
cellular DNA copying systems are not perfect, and the more times they
copy the more likely they are to make a mistake.  Additionally, there is
a limit to the number of times a cell can copy itself, this was likely
evolved as a mechanism to delay the onset of cancer past reproductive
ages.

On the contrary, small amounts of stress and pollutants actually
decrease the likelyhood of getting cancer, as it puts into action stress
repair mechanisms that are inactive at lower levels.  Refer to this
months special issue of Scientific American, which has an article about
the effect.  Some CR practitioners accomplish CR by eating every other
day, but eating normally on those days, as (they say) it enacts the
stress mechanisms associated with slowing the rate of aging and delaying
the onset of cancers.  That scientific American article infacts suggests
that the very stringent pollutants requirements in post industrialized
nations actually cause more cancers then if they were slightly less
stringent.  Although there is a point where the cancer incidinces
increase with stress levels / exposure rates.

Being over 95

Being a long term smoker over 35

>Which is more likely to cause cancer:
>_ Exposure to radioactive materials
>_ genetic disposition to cancer

Depends on the dose, but probably a genetic predisposition, as 50% of
all people who have cancer have, for starters, a mutation in the p53
gene.

The general public's understanding of carcinogenic threats is pretty
much opposite of the real threats.  An average young adult who drinks
and smokes socially will probably get cancer from his drinking, not his
smoking.  The vast majority of cancer causing agents are *natural* as
plants prefer not to be eaten, and have evolved millions of natural
pesticides, most of which have never seen the inside of an EPA lab.  A
single veggie may contain more natural and carcinogenic pesticides then
you will consume as an average american of synthetic carcinogenic
pesticides over your entire life, yet so far the EPA only tests
synthetic ones.  Refer to the HERP index sometime, a single glass of
beer has 300 times the cancer causing agents that a typical
industrialized agriculture apple does.  Coffee is even worse.  And
people who are thin and health have far lower incidences of cancer, even
though they are subjected to the same environmental barrage.  Diet is
the single most influential controllable factor, far more so than
radiation or pollutants, by orders of magnitude.

Didn't Julian Simon provide plenty of evidence that pollution was 
decreasing over all interesting recent periods?  Does Weinberg cite any 
statistics or studies to show that pollution was increasing, or is he 
falling for a common wisdom that has been shown to be false?

To assert that an anarchy will always remain an equal division of threat
and power is absurd.  I feel it reasonable to assume smaller and smaller
groups will amass more and more power, leading to war lords and fuedel
asque societies.  I do not prefer to live in a society ruled only by the
barrel of a Gun.

The point I am trying to make is that if a in an anarchist society,
someone provides protection as a service, then the good ol economics of
scale will come into play, and the larger protection groups will provide
better protection for less cost.  Eventually, one or two of them will
have the vast majority of the clientelle, really not functionally much
different from a minarchist state.  How would such a growth of power be
stopped in a 'peaceful anarchy' or anarchy socialist (I imaging it
wouldn't be any issue in an anarcho-capitalist society)

A much more complex issue I don't feel to delve into.  As a minarchist
liberterian, I would probably agree with the vast majority of your
complaints of government.  In most of the comments, I am trying to
understand Robbie's position, not presenting my own theory of moral
statehood.

Spreadsheets were on of the first places I missed fame.  In 1981 I was working 
as a tech for a bunch of Reservoir Engineers.  We had a nice little super 
computer simulating Prudhoe Bay holdings across a lot of wells over thousands 
of feet of depth (for some variables) over time.  But the output was a linear 
mess (tape only) that the engineers would work with from huge printouts using 
HP calculators.  Eventually it was more than I could take any more.  So I 
transferred the data to disk in a clever format that loaded quickly and built 
a pseudo-English formula engine for defining and computing formulas/data 
sets/"cells" if you like  and printing  and plotting them.   Various types of 
original and computed values had various dimensionality up to 4 dimensions.   
The underlying formula language was fairly sophisticated with around 200 
production rules in the LALR parser I had no choice but to hand-roll.  In 
normal spreadsheet manner the derived variables/data-sets would recalculate 
as any part of the underlying data or dependent defintions changed.  A rich 
set of scientific math fucntions was available and formulas could be defined 
on various slices and selections of the data matrices using all available 
mathematical functions and equations based on them.  Formulas/eqations were 
also named functions that could be used to derive other formulas. Too bad I 
wasn't paying attention to micros and didn't realize I had the makings of a 
multi-dimensional spreadsheet in hand at a time when a dumb 2-d data matrix 
was about to take the world by storm.   Ah well.   Impetuous youth.  I was 
too busy having fun with the shiny toys.

And that "increase in numbers" is a big part of the problem.  Not the 
only part, but a big part.  I don't see any easy answers.  But I'm 
reminded of the fur statistics from the Hudson Bay Company on Canadian 
Lynx populations.  They would periodically peak, and then crash.  Hard. 
  Because of the depletion of the resources (rabbits, I believe) on 
which they depended.  And the rabbit population went through a similar 
cycle, but offset in time by 6 mo.s to a year (I forget exactly).  They 
crashed because diseases became widespread.  We *must* control the 
population, but we don't want to.  Some governments try very hard, 
China, e.g., and, to a much lesser extent, India.  Others refuse to even 
accept the need (the US comes to mind, and the Catholic church).
If the population could be evenly decimated, many of the current ills 
would vanish.  But imagine the trauma of a global disease that killed 9 
out of 10 people!  Control of the population growth, sending it way 
negative, is the optimal choice, but even that moderate step would have 
immense negative consequences.  As the population aged there would be 
fewer young people which would mean that social policies would become 
inflexible.  Schools wouldn't be properly supported (well, they aren't 
now, so that's not much change) becase so few were parents.  Etc.  Of 
course, this might cause the age of retirement to be pushed further out, 
but it wouldn't necessarily have that result, as increasing automation 
is continuing to remove jobs.  But people need to be *trained* for the 
jobs that remain.  And many already so distrust the system (for valid 
historic reasons) that it would require tremendous efforts to convince 
them to give it another try.  Still, the change *WOULD* be slow, which 
is both it's benefit and it drawback.

Note that policies that restrict parents to one child will have severe 
side-effects.  In China it's not uncommon for parents to abandon a child 
who is seen as defective, so that it can be replaced with one that may 
be better.  I am reminded of Larry Niven's world of the ARM and the 
birth-right lotteries.

It starts to become crucial to project just how far away the singularity 
is.  The unpleasant side effects appear quickly, and the beneficial 
effects take many years to dominate (presuming that an unpopular 
practice can be maintained that long).  If the singularity is less than 
20 years away, perhaps the best choice is to try to "muddle through". 
(Remembering that the ramp up in change rate before the sigularity will 
already be imposing huge social changes and stresses.)

OTOH, "No man knoweth the hour...".  The "son of man" may appear 
overnight.  It may appear as a distributed intelligence on the internet. 
  We can hope that it will be as beneficient as we have dreamed, but if 
it appears in a fast takeoff mode, and isn't designed, then that will be 
"gartuitous grace".  (Sorry for all the religious stuff in this 
paragraph, but that language really seems the best shorthand to consider 
fast takeoff AI in.  It *will* appear to be a miracle, whether of 
benevolent or malevolent nature.)

Be quite careful here.  The basic distortion is that the corporation is 
granted the rights of a person, without simultaneous having the limits 
or obligations of a person.

Limited Liability Corporations legitimately shield their investors from 
many liabilities for the actions in corporations that the investors 
theoretically have partial ownership in, but over which they actually 
neither have either reasonable control or detailed knowledge.  But I 
know of no ground for shielding the executives of the corporation from 
liability, as seems to be common practice.  And I also feel that the 
board of directors should be more liable.  And the individual employees, 
whether executives or not.  If a corporation pours poison in a 
communities drinking water, then the entire chain of personnel involved 
should be liable.  To the extent that they either knew or should have 
known.  And one scapegoat should not be allowed to exculpate the rest.

This vile example is based on a case where company (Monsanto?) 
calculated that it would cost them less in fines to dump poison in a 
community's drinking water supply than it would to clean it up properly. 
  So they did.  And they were right.  Even though internal memos 
released during the trial showed that they had made this calculation 
ahead of time.  Personally I think this was ground for confiscating the 
entire corpation, and selling it for it's assets, and for sending most 
of the management and most of the directors to jail for premeditated 
murder and many of the staff to jail for accessory during the fact.  But 
they were, instead, given the fine which, as they had calculated, was 
less than the cost of cleaning things up properly was.

As for the investors...most of them still don't know that it happened. 
And many don't even know that they are investors.  (Investment through 
market large cap funds, e.g.)  So while it's a reasonable penalty that 
they should loose their investment, they bear no real culpability.

My point is simply this:

Modern concepts of causation are not deterministic.  In our current 
understanding of the causes of cancer, both age and toxins are factors. 
  On this I think we all agree.  Take away the toxins - who knows.  Take 
away the age - who knows.  After that it's ALL conjecture.

Robbie

That would be assuming things like "breathing air" or "existing under 
the sun" doesn't cause cancer.

The rest of your point I've already made.

As for whether or not plants cause cancer - maybe they do, but that 
wouldn't explain why it's a greater killer now than 200 years ago.  For 
that you'd have to add in the social factors.

Yes.  But they are harder to construct, and much more theoretically 
intractible than zero sum games.  In fact, the last I heard the only 
ones that could be effectively dealt with on a theoretic basis were the 
ones that could be decomposed and transformed into a much more 
complicated pair of zero-sum games.  But that this covered only a 
fragment of the available forms.  (OTOH, this was 3 decades ago, and at 
the undergraduate level.)

At any particular time the earth has a limited amount of wealth. 
Actually, on theoretical grounds one could maintain that there was a 
finite limit on the possible amount of wealth deriveable from the earth 
over any specific finite span of time.  But I don't know how one could 
estimate how close we were to the theoretic limits.  And knowledge plays 
a big role here.

And you can come up with an example of some other government that was 
even approximately moral?  I can't.  The more history I studied, the 
less moral governments appeared.  Stalin was unusual in that prior 
"incarnations" had to use cruder technologies.  But you could ask the 
Comanche about the morality of the US.  Or the Mohicans, if you could 
find any.  Or the Iriquois.  Or...  But finding another government that 
was any better would be quite difficult.  Canada, perhaps.  But then I 
haven't studied their history.  Nepal.  But then they've never had the 
power to be evil on a large scale.

How about:
"Everything that's theoretically tractible is reframeable into a 
zero-sum game."  (N.B.:  This can involve combining the participants 
into a team playing against "the rules of the universe" or some such.)

The last time I encountered game theory, I think that was considered a 
true statement.  And, of course, there are many positive and negative 
sum games that are not theoretically tractible.  The prisoner's dilemma 
is probably the classic simple one.  And it can be framed as either a 
positive or a negative sum game (though not all can).

We do know that certain pollutants cause cancer.  That cancer can occur 
without them implies that there *are* other causes, but doesn't affect 
that certain pollutants cause cancer (or at least encourage the maturing 
of precancerous conditions into cancerous conditions).

>>We don't KNOW that age does.  

Well, yes, we do.  It takes time, sometimes a long time, for a single 
cancerous cell to even become a detectable group, much less a full 
tumor.  Many cancers that strike adults have been growing since they 
were quite young, perhaps teens.  If these same mutations had occurred 
when they were in their 60's, the cancer would never have 
happened...unless they lived to be around 200 (cell division slows as 
aging occurs).  Or unless they were given some encouragement to grow 
more quickly.  Say, perhaps, HGH.

I'll say it, in the limited sense of my prior paragraph.  And I'll also 
assert that certain kinds of pollution cause it.  Perhaps by encouraging 
cells to divide that otherwise wouldn't have.

It depends a lot on which pollutant you measure.  Also where.  But there 
are certainly lots of pollutants around now that didn't even exist 
before 1970.

It's because it's code for "They won't do what I say any more."  When 
they were younger they would generally do as they were told, but when 
they hit the teen years they are genetically programmed to become more 
independant.  Only in a tech civilization they can't.  (And tech, here, 
includes camel harnesses...not just high tech, but tech in the "more 
than they can learn+acquire in 10 years" sense.

So conflict occurs.  It's supposed to drive the kids out to form their 
own household.  But they can't do that any more.  And the parents are 
supposed to object.  So they do.  But it doesn't have to make any sense, 
because it has to be something that can be forgotten once they've moved 
out.

I'm still not sure why ownership without responsibility is regarded
as a good thing, here.  Why should we contort the legal system to
reward owner negligence?  Rather, let the owners own, and investors
own shares of profit, instead of the company itself.  This still
protects those who invest, and doesn't create an exception for
certain kinds of owners of property.

There's a better reason that that.  The oil is nearly gone.  Current 
estimates say that 2001 (2000?, 2002?) was probably the highest year for 
pumping oil from the ground that will ever happen.  And getting the 
first half of the oil out is a lot cheaper than getting the second half 
of the oil out.  So look for oil prices to start climbing fast.  Until 
it becomes expensive enough that oil shales are profitable.  Then we'll 
have awhile to adapt, and the higher oil prices will make alternative 
more affordable (by comparison).  But higher oil prices will raise the 
price of EVERYTHING.  Ouch!

And that's probably why we invaded the middle east.  To buy us a few 
more years.  Doesn't make it ethical, but makes it a bit more 
understandable.  (It's also why France got so pissed off at us.  They 
had made arrangements to acquire that oil, and we stole it.  Were I 
France, I'd be pissed off too.  But their arrangements were only 
slightly more ethical than ours.  Well, maybe twice as ethical.  But 
still pretty far from any base line.)

Exactly right IMO. Limited liability can arise (and has) through the
mechanisms of contract, without any resort to legislation. The problems
arise when this is combined by legislation with 'perpetual succession', so
making corporations  immortal individuals which have powers actual
individuals do not have (such as owning shares in other 'legal persons').
Historically there were two kinds of corporate business, one had limited
liability but no perpetual succession (i.e. a limited lifespan) the other
had perpetual succession but full liability. Modern company legislation
combines the two.

Again, I agree. This is not a new problem. See the remarks Adam Smith makes
about this or the very prescient comments of Herbert Spencer in his essay
"Railway Morals and Railway Policy". (Spencer opposed the 1858 Companies Act
BTW).

It's a good thing because it's the only was that large constructions can 
be accomplished without an authoritarian government.  I believe that the 
first one was the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London, and it was used 
to essentiall build London.

But these small investors can't know what it being done in their name. 
The have ownership, but not control.  Those who have control are the 
ones who should bear moral/legal responsibility.  But a limited fiscal 
responsibility is reasonable.

Another way of saying it is the minor stockholders don't really own the 
corporations.  They are merely lending their fiscal resources.  If you 
don't control something, you don't own it.  If you do control it, 
pertending that you aren't responsible because you don't own it should 
be no defense.

Even this provide a morally vacuous veil for investors.  consider:

Rupert Murdoch gives you $1,000,000,000 dollars to form a corporation.  
He takes no ownership of the corporation, but rather a cut of the 
profits.

Let's say that corporation exists for the sole purpose of extracting 
precious metals from third-world countries by force.

Rupert's still INNOCENT of this as he deposits the first $1,000,000 
return in the first month?

PUHLEEZE.

It's obviously FALSE that LLC's have arisen without resort to 
legislation.  LLC's have different legal dispositions in different 
states and their ability to deflect legal responsibility from their 
owners differs from state-to-state to.  The law is very specific about 
what kinds of things and LLC can and can not do.

It's likely false that they COULD.  It's possible that you could write 
a contract (without the backing of a government) that would "in theory" 
limit your liability, it wouldn't ACTUALLY limit your liability because 
without the government to INSIST that your liability is limited, the 
victims of the companies "ERRORS" would come after you with pitchforks 
(assuming they could find out who you were and what you'd done "by 
proxy").

Like hell they are not (deterministic) -- its pretty clear at this point
if you have certain mutations in the p53 gene (or a number of other tumor
suppressor genes) they will become nonfunctional and you will likely
develop cancer at some point.

As has been noted, some low level of toxins may be helpful.  Taking
them away entirely could be quite harmful.  Whether this will be the
case depends on individual genetic makeup.  So while it may be a
"who knows" situation now because we cannot genotype every single
individual affordably -- it will *not* be a "who knows" situation
in the future when we have that technological capability.  The
bottom line will be that toxins are harmful to some -- but not others.

With respect to "age" it is the same problem -- you either have
a genotype that allows one to be susceptible to cancer or one
does not.  Human cells accumulate mutations in the genetic
program over time.  Thus the longer one has lived the greater
the chances that one has accumulated mutations that will cause
cells to become cancerous.  Thus age is linked to cancer.  The
people who don't get cancer may simply be thankful that they
die (perhaps prematurely) from some other defect in their genetic
program (or an accident).

Cancer is a process in which genomes become corrupted so that cells
do not behave as the initial genome design dictated.  Some of that
may be caused by toxin exposure and some of that may simply be caused
by "living" (e.g. free radical damage caused by normal oxidative
metabolism).  Which is more important is not "conjecture" -- it
is a combination of environment and genetics.  And there is reasonably
solid data on how different aspects of these bias ones risks.
(For example living in a home with high radon levels definitely
slants one towards cancer -- not "conjecture".  But at the same
time not everyone gets cancer and this comes down to genetic
predispositions.)

Its called entropy.  Even if anti-oxidants destroyed every unbound
electron pair in free radicals, even if all ionizing radiation is
shielded, even if were are examing cells in a controlled petri dish in a
perfect environment.  Some of those cells will eventually become
cancerous.  This is because the cellular copying mechanisms are not
perfect, and cancers are just cells with different genetic structures.

Look, no offense, but I don't think you know anything about cancer.  I
am no world renowned oncology expert, but cancer has been a subject of
interest for me.  Plants did not cause cause because for the last
900,000 years people DIED before enough mutations built up to cause a
cell to reproduce, undifferentiated, as quickly as possible, which is
what cancer is.  It takes *at least* five mutations for a cell to become
cancerous, 50% of cancerous cells have a mutation in the p53 gene, if
one of your parents gamete cells has that mutation, you are far more
likely to get cancer throughout your lifetime then people without that
mutation.  Its not just any five mutations, but a whole score of
mutations can occur in different places in the genome.  But only some of
those places of your genome, when changed, will make a cell cancerous.
At least five of the target areas have to be mutation.  Mutations can
come from a variety of sources, free radicals, ionizing radiation,
toxins, etc. etc.  But there must be at least five.  Any particular cell
has a particular chance of getting a mutation throughout its life.  The
longer a cell lives, the more mutations it gets.  When that cell
replicates, its child cells inherient its mutations.  Just as a child
whose parents have one of the critical mutations has now every cell in
his body with that mutation, all child cells of a mutated parent cells
in any being also inherient all mutations.  Eventually, all cells in
your body (with the exception of nuerons) are child cells of parents,
and more and more cells in your body get more and more mutations as you
exist longer and longer.  This is why age is so directly tied to
increase in cancer cases.  IF a child is born with four of the five
required mutations *in every cell of his body* he will probably get
cancer at a very young age, since only one cell in his entire body needs
to have the correct area of his genome mutated.  

In short, it does explain it, you just don't understand it.  I suggest
you refrain from making assertive comments of areas where you do not
have sufficient background knowledge to be that assertive.

Facts not in evidence.  200 years ago, the average lifespan was
significantly less -- perhaps as much as 50%.  So people died
prematurely from various diseases (plague, flu, smallpox, etc.)
before the mutations that cause cancer could come into play.

You cannot use that argument.  Cancer is a greater killer now
simply because things like vaccines, antibiotics and better
nutrition allow people to live longer and therefore they have
a greater risk of developing cancer.  The human genetic program
never evolved to the point where it could prevent cancer from
developing in 80 year olds -- because during most of our evolution
people never lived to 80 (this is called the "declining force of
natural selection" in the study of gerontology).

A friend of mine posted this on another forum...

-------

Today [11 Sep] Dr. Edward Teller died at 95. For those who don't know who he
was, he was the father of the H-bomb, one of the men instrumental in getting
Roosevelt to start the Manhatten project, director at LLNL, and one of the
brightest atomic physicists the world has known. He led a controversial
life; designed the H-bomb (fusion bomb), blamed for the downfall of
Oppenheimer, largely responsible for our lead in the cold war, and an
outspoken proponent of a missile defense system. He had been awarded the
Albert Einstein Award, the Enrico Fermi Award and the National Medal of
Science.

His death marks the end of an era of great physicists like Einstein, Fermi,
Feynman, Bethe, Pauli, Dirac, Schroedinger, Lawrence, Landau, Gell-Man,
Bohr.

On a personal note I knew Dr. Teller at various phases of my life and was
always impressed with him. When I was in High School I took a series of
classes from him in Livermore. At that time he was 85, almost blind, almost
deaf, but sharp as a tack. I was very surprised how approachable he was,
often staying for a good while afterwards to talk with students. He felt it
was imperative that the younger generations embrace science and he made it
his mission to get students interested in the field of physics. I remember
when I'd ask him questions after the classes he always seemed very
interested and would encourage more questions. Second to my father's
influence, Dr. Teller was probably the most influential person in my life
when it came to my interest in science.
Seven years later I was accepted into the Department of Applied Science at
UC Davis for my graduate program. I didn't find out until afterwards that it
was a department that Edward Teller started in the 60s and still interacted
with. He had found then that at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory many
scientists weren't really trained to work in a lab environment, so he
convinced the UC system to put a science department onsite at the lab.
Students would take classes in the UC building and participate in real
research at LLNL, producing scientists with the training and education to
start working productively at the lab as soon as they graduated (and
before). He served as the department director for a number of years and
since as director emiritus.

Over the years I attended DAS, Dr. Teller came and had lunch with the
students on many occasions. He was very blind, almost deaf, and barely able
to walk, but like the decade prior he had the mind of a 20 year old. His
favorite topic in these get-togethers was to speak on the importance of
scientists to use their technology and knowledge responsibly. He was always
friendly and always interested in what projects the various students were
involved in at the Lab. He also always knew a good deal about whatever
program you were in, the history behind it and the current research being
done in the field. My last impression of him was that he was still the
friendly, interested, and approachable man he was 12 years earlier. He will
be missed.

The fact that something was done in a particular way doesn't

I agree with your second statement.

If you control something, you DO own it.  I agree, however, that
the current USian legal system is really screwed up on this point,
among others.

Well, I think Steve's statement was about limited liability in
general, rather than the specific legal structure in some
USian States called "LLC"s.

Sure!  Seriously.

To clarify, I think it's a bad idea to pay someone else to
steal something, but it *is* the other person who stole it,
and who owes it back.  People are responsible for their own
actions.  They are not responsible for anyone else's, except
by contract.

IMHO, of course; not as a practical matter in the world in
which we live.

Obviously you don't know the meaning of "non-deterministic"

"likely ... at some point" are "non-deterministic" phraseology.

Consider the opposite:

"Definitely at 3:00pm"  - that would be determinism.

It's hard to say whether or not this is an epistemological lack or an 
ontological "missing piece".  I've heard that the human eye can 
distinguish difference of light intensity of 10 photons.  (I think JR 
Lucas said this, I don't know where he got his data).

In any case, it may be strictly speaking NON-DETERMINISTIC whether or 
not someone will get cancer.  It may not.  But right now since the 
underlying physics of EVERYTHING is non-deterministic, we should expect 
it simply to be non-deterministic even in the case of higher-level 
biology.

As far as I know Hume's criticism of "deterministic causation" qua 
constant conjunction is still a devestating argument against causal 
determinism.  In statistical sciences (like epidemiology) it's 
axiomatic.

That there's a possibility that in the future our underlying theory of 
everything might change is always a negligible possibility.  There's no 
concrete proposal there to be asserted or denied.

Best,

robbie

I suggest we may have a disagreement about what "probably" means.

Now I'm no doctor but I can tell the difference between "Will" and

Why is it such a controversial proposition that the noxious fumes, 
radioactive waste, heavy metals and other KNOWN CARCINOGENS that we 
spew forth into the atmosphere, water and earth at a rate of 
100,000,000 tonnes/year are killing us because they are carcinogenic?


I've granted your point (in fact, I'm sure I made it myself) - getting 
older TAUTOLOGICALLY gives more exposure to cancer causing agents.

SO WHAT?

Isn't the point that we will all continue to get older NO MATTER WHAT 
so the obvious course of action is to reduce the exposure to the 
cancer-causing agents.  To do that will require a significant reworking 
of our political economy.

Is there something really THAT controversial about my claims here?

Is the "LLC" one of Plato's Ideas?  An Hegelian "Absolute Notion"?  A 
Fregean "Concept"?

Is there an "ideal LLC"?  Should there be?

Exactly. There's nothing to stop individuals or groups of individuals from
drawing up contracts that limit the liability of one or both parties (it's
an example of contracting out of or around obligations). That's not the same
thing as the specific legal institution of the LLC, which was invented
pretty recently (mid-nineteenth century to be precise).

Robbie also said

It's likely false that they COULD.  It's possible that you could write
a contract (without the backing of a government) that would "in theory"
limit your liability, it wouldn't ACTUALLY limit your liability because
without the government to INSIST that your liability is limited, the
victims of the companies "ERRORS" would come after you with pitchforks
(assuming they could find out who you were and what you'd done "by
proxy").

That's empirically false I'm afraid. Historically there have been mutual
enterprise contracts in which the liability of the investors for debts
arising from the enterprise were limited to the invested capital. These were
time limited (originally usually for one voyage - if Antonio had had any
brains that's what he would have done). The people who entered into
contractual arrangements with such a partnership were well aware of it and
could adjust their prices to take account of the perceived greater risk if
any. Point is it wasn't backed up by a legislated authority, so if the
perceived risk was too great no one would deal with the partnership. Also,
as I said, it didn't have perpetual succession, so the liability was limited
in time to the lifetime of the partnership.

Actually, they may be right about Barbie.  Damn thing sickens me.

Why don't they cover the thing in cloth, cut a slit for the eyes, file down 
the breasts, and call it "Burqa Barbie"?

Her husband could be "Koranic Ken".

The point being that the investors may have limited their liability 
PHYSICALLY by being completely detached from the mission, but I'll bet 
whoever the ships were sent to exploit wouldn't see it that way if they 
got them in a room alone.

Once again, the point being that the Moral Liability for desecrating 
someone's homeland, for instance, should not be disclaim-able simply 
because someone ELSE writes their contracts that way.  And in fact, by 
nature, they are not disclaim-able.  Only when backed by FORCE or 
DECEPTION can liability be avoided.  If the natives who's homelands are 
desecrated by the ships funded by the LLC's members find out who the 
members are, their outrage can only be blocked by 
force/deception/coercion.

Robbie

It would be nice to have some data on the number of children that died of
cancer 200 years ago as compared to now.

Oh, I don't know. I'd think that the death of Gell-Mann, when it happens,
will do that.

The typical justification for these charges runs lumps
big corporations in with (usually US) government.  In
this case, lots more oil at reduced prices is flowing
into certain oil companies than would have without US
action; said companies have indirect financial links
to many in the administration, who personally profit.
There is enough indirection in the system to avoid
trivial proof, and a more in-depth proof - assuming
the justification is correct - would require the type
of lawsuit that typically gets thrown out of court
quickly (before discovery can happen) for want of
specific charges and pre-discovery evidence.

Already disproven, at least the scale.  (It's possible
there may be a minor rise in prices over the next
several years.  But we're talking, worst case, gas
prices double - after accounting for inflation -
sometime well after 2010.)  Google for the proof, or
just search this list's archives.

The oil was coming out regardless.  Maybe a bit more
will go through US refineries, and the profits will be
distributed differently, but it would have been in
circulation above the ground.

Yet your knowledge of cancer is way off.  Do you or do you not
acknowledge that?  I note you ignore the entire theme of the message,
and just focus on my saying 'probably'  I don't disagree with you what
'probably' means, this is an issue you and Robert Bradbury have in
terminology, my issue was your suggestion that the large rise in cancer
we are seeing is from pollution.  Do you still hold that opinion? 

On Friday, September 12, 2003, at 11:05  AM, Robert J. Bradbury wrote:

You keep tossing red herrings into the debates, but never acknowledge
the points all ready discussed.  Do you still hold the opinion that if
plants caused cancer then people of the past should have gotten cancer,
and therefore plants do not cause cancer?

It is not controversial, no doubt that is the case.  Some cases of
cancer are certainly from these things, but you assert that the majority
of cancers, in fact the steep rise in cases of cancers over the past few
decades is primarily attributed to these things, the presence of these
things helps to actually lower the overall incidences of cancer (when
present below certain thresholds).  This is NOT the case, as I have
elaborated on and argued, DIET is the primary cause of cancer.   What we
eat (natural plants with natural pesticides) and how much of it we eat.

They don't talk much about mechanisms etc in the article but it *sounds*
like a bit of a breakthrough.

Interesting that the articles states Alzheimer's is not a matter of if, but
of
when. I've a 89 year old grandmother that's had it (started showing
symptoms) for a couple of years. Stopping it in animal models sounds
good. As does the part about the brains having the capacity to repair
once further damage is stopped.

However, to inject a note of caution, so far few drugs have actually 
resulted from the high throughput screening systems. There have been 
some reviews in Nature Pharmacology lamenting that despite great strides 
in the basic science and methods, the drug pipelines still run rather 
empty.

We're talking at cross purposes a bit here. The kind of limited liability
contracts I was talking about were made by merchants engaged in regular,
peaceful trade. The liability that was limited was the financial liability
incurred to suppliers, subcontractors etc ie one that arose in the course of
trading. This is what LL covers in the modern legal system as well. What you
are talking about (forgive me if I'm wrong) is the legal and moral liability
of officers and investors for the harm done to third parties as a
consequence of the corporation's activities (whether as externalities or
directly). That's a different issue, on the whole I agree with you rather
than Charles. The problem here is not LL per se but the way modern
corporations work and interact with the political process. Undoubtedly there
is a general ducking of responsibility going on. As a historical footnote
the kind of imperialist 'trade' you refer to (as carried on by the East
India Company, VVD et al) was carried out by chartered corporations given LL
by political fiat. Steve Davies

Actually Michael, this may not be strictly true -- yes the p53 gene
and retinoblastoma (RB gene) mutations do certainly bias cells towards
cancer.  The standard "5 mutations" model is used mainly with colon
cancer I believe.  But there are other types of cancer, esp. leukemia
where the primary culprit is chromosome rearrangements (do a google
on "Philadelphia Chromosome").  These are due to faulty DNA double
strand break repair processes (i.e. 2 chromosomes break and they
mismatched in the repair process).  One could call this a "mutation"
but it generally isn't identified as such.

I think the counts at this point are something like 15-20 tumor suppressor
genes (like p53 and RB) and perhaps 50-100 tumor promoter genes.  One
generally has to get mutations in several of the tumor promoter genes
and 1 or more of the tumor supressor genes before the cell becomes
cancerous.  The p53 gene is a particular weak point because it seems
it plays a critical part of deciding whether the cell should commit apoptosis
(suicide) if things get too messed up.

Yes, but I would probably say that each specific type of cancer
results from an accumulation of a specific set of mutations
(or genomic changes) that cause the normal cellular control
processes to become defective.  That is why you can view aging
in part of the flip side of the coin from cancer.  We *know* from
cancer research that mutations and chromosomal rearrangements
are taking place.  One has to ask what kind of damage results
from the same types of mutations and rearrangements taking place
in those genes that are not involved in tumor suppression or
tumor promotion?  If one has a few hundred genes involved in
regulating cell division then one has 30,000+ genes involved
in dealing with other stuff.  What happens as they gradually
go bad?

Not strictly true as pointed out above.

> Eventually, all cells in

Not quite accurate.  Obviously all the cells in your body are the child cells
of parent cells.  Different cells in your body have different regenerative
schedules.  The way I like to describe it is to consider the human body
to be organized like a doughnut.  The cells on the surface of the doughnut
are exposed to the environment -- these are primarily biased to renew
themselves on a regular basis (these are epithelial cells of one form
or another and are found in the skin, stomach, intestine, lung).  The
other major system biased towards cellular renewal are the blood and
immune systems.  These are the systems that are the primary sites where
cancer develops.  The other systems are biased towards reproduction
are those involved in reproduction (breast, ovary, prostate, etc.).
There are many systems biased against reproduction (heart, other muscles,
brain, kidney, etc.).  In these cancer is much less common.  The liver
appears to be the odd organ in that it is normally in non-cell-division
mode but can be shifted into cell-division mode if it is damaged enough.

So one can view tissues that are biased towards cellular division
as already having a genetic program with a few "mutations" that
can lead down the path to cancer.  (When was the last time you
heard of someone getting "heart cancer"?)

Now, dealing with Robbie's claims -- I would suggest that you go
do a google on "aflatoxin grain cancer".  Aflatoxin is a toxin
produced by a natural fungus that is known to cause a specific
mutation(s) in the p53 gene.  It is a primary source of liver cancer
in China which has few or no constraints on the levels of aflatoxin
that may be present in grains or peanuts (which are particularly
susceptible to the fungus).  Now could you please explain how a toxin
produced by a natural fungus can be considered a "pollutant"?
The rise in exposure to aflatoxin is a consequence of the fact that
over the last several thousand years humans learned to store food
sources to allow them to survive years when crop harvests are poor.
So you can die from starvation or you may eventually die from cancer
due to long term aflatoxin exposure.  Take your pick.

I am not saying that there is not any evidence that pollutants do
not contribute to cancer.  For example, there is overwhelming evidence
that some of the substances in tobacco smoke -- which one can probably
consider to be a pollutant -- do contribute to mutations and cancer
in a significant subset of the human population (in large part due
to their genetic makeup most probably).  However other pollutants,
such as lead, may have little relation to cancer but may instead
impact other functions such a neuronal development or activity.

And in fact it *is* possible using chelation therapy to treat
overexposure to metals.  It is much more difficult to deal with
the mutations to the genomic DNA caused by plant toxins.

Kevin, I agree that it would be interesting data but I suspect
it would be a minor blip in the childhood death rates due to
the childhood diseases for which there were no vaccines and/or
malnutrition.  For those reasons it might not be possible to
use the data productively.  On top of that one has to consider the
environment -- are you talking industrial London (which was probably
much more polluted than modern cities -- remember coal was the primary
fuel back then) or non-industrial cities (say Bombay)?

Most (though perhaps not all) childhood cancers are due to defects
in the developmental process.  They are the result of the random
errors in the process of replicating DNA -- or in some cases predisposing
errors that may have taken place in the production of gamete cells.
Perhaps the best example of a drug (not a pollutant) causing
problems in either gamete production or early development would
be thalidomide [1,2,3].

Don't count out Dyson either -- he's still alive and kicking -- I've
even had a couple of emails from him.

For those who don't know, Dyson probably should have shared in the
1965 Nobel Prize for Physics [1], due to his work putting together
different theories in [2].  I think however the Nobel prize is
restricted to 3 people unfortunately.

Damn, death sucks.  I'm not sure about all of the people pointed out
but I would *really* like to have had the opportunity to meet Feynman.

Robert, thanks for the excellent info.  I find this topic very
interesting and will certainly do the research you suggest.  I did not
think the 'five mutation' model was completely accurate in all cases,
but from the rest of your descriptions, it seems it, or something very
similar, is the case in most forms of cancer with the exception being
luekemia.  I will definitely read up on the biological processes
responsible for leukemia.

So the five mutation model may not describe every form of cellular
cancer, there are probably four mutation or eight mutation variants?
The number of mutations may differ, but is seems safe to say the
principle and the requirement for certain number of certain mutations to
take place is still valid.

My main point was that once a cell gets a mutation, all of its offspring
have that same mutation (unless some are lucky enough to have that
mutation reversed accidently) Thus the older you get, the more likely
you are to have more of your cells have more and more mutations, even in
the absence of pollution or radiation.

I think this question was rhetorical, I have been saying all along that
natural sources contribute to far more cases of cancers than man made
pollutants or radiation.  Since virtually all plants we eat are pumped
full of natural pesticides.  Whether or not natural pesticides or toxins
should be called 'pollutants' seems more of a semantic issue, though I
would answer no to that.  

Robbie, is a natural toxin a 'pollutant'?

I am sure there are many more examples like the one you cite, and
probably many that have nothing to do with human behavior.  It has been
only very recently that the EPA has payed *any* attention at all to
natural carcinogens.  Too busy obsessed with placing all the blame on
'evil corporations' as Robbie seems to be, instead of actually trying to
get an accurate description of reality.

I am sure there are many made made pollutants which are specifically
carcinogenic, but I don't think I would consider smoking in that
category, since it is generally a chosen behavior (pollutant as in
something people get subjected to against their preferences)  But again,
I will continue to argue unless presented with evidence suggesting
otherwise that the vast majority of cancers come from diet, both what we
eat and how much of it, and for how long we have been eating it.  

All this talk of Diet and cancer makes me want to stop procrastinating
and do a CR diet.

You have to realize that cancer goes through 3 stages.  First,
uncontrolled cell division.  Second, production of angiogenisis
factors to increase blood supply (and therefore nutrient availability).
Third, metastasis where the cancer spreads throughout the body.

If you can limit it to the first stage it is less probable
that cancer can kill an individual.  The progression through
each of the stages involves the expansion of cells with a
greater number of specific mutations or chromosome rearrangements.
There is a fairly large debate right now within the cancer researcher
community if chromosome rearrangements might not be the start of the
problem followed by mutations rather than the other way around.
I suspect it will turn out to be a mix perhaps depending on cancer
type.

Sure.  The problem is that "mutations" tends to be a general term
and one has to get down to specifics -- these can include things
like "point mutations" (i.e. the change of a specific base so the
protein does not function as it is supposed to), deletions (i.e.
a section of the gene gets deleted), insertions (i.e. some extra
code gets inserted into the DNA), and chromosome segment exchanges
(that produce cases where genes that are supposed to be off get turned
on or genes that are supposed to be on get turned off).

Its a mess when you get into the details.

Yes, that is why most cancers occur in cells that are significantly biased
to divide -- they probably need fewer mutations to run amok.  Reversal
is unlikely -- it is more likely that your immune system just might
be able to recognize the signs of cancerous (malformed) proteins within
a cell and take out the offending cells.  This is difficult but serves
as an interesting explanation behind the remission of some cancers.

I would guess that free radicals and radiation are the primary sources.
That would explain why cancer remains relatively constant across people
with a wide variety of diets that may or may not contain various toxins.
Free radicals would also explain in part why CR is effective in extending
longevity -- fewer free radicals leads to less DNA damage leads to less
cancer (as well as other causes of "aging").

The problem, IMO, is that it appears cells use various pro-oxidant
molecules (e.g. nitric oxide, perhaps superoxide, etc.) as signal
molecules and so they compensate for the amount of anti-oxidant molecules
that may be available.  That explains why massive supplementation of
anti-oxidants only has limited effectiveness in extending lifespan.

I think that natural toxins may play only a limted role.
For example several types of cancer have been linked to viruses
(e.g. HPV).  Others are linked to numbers of hormonal cycles that
promote cell division (e.g. breast cancer).

Some individuals clearly have molecular signal systems where
natural toxins actually help more than they hurt.  This makes the
whole process of attempting to adopt a useful strategy a nightmare
because we don't currently relatively inexpensive genotyping that
would allow one to determine whether such toxins help more than
they hurt.  As a side note -- the systems that metabolize the
plant toxins are relatively the same as those that metabolize
drugs.  So it is effectively impossible for physicians to prescribe
drug doses that work well without a complete understanding of
ones genetic systems that remove toxins/drugs from ones body.
The variations in rates and processes of metabolizing toxins/drugs
can be quite significant from individual to individual.  There
are probably 50 or more genes involved.  Each gene may have
multiple variations within a population because they only impact
reproductive and survival capacity to a very limited extent --
so natural evolution will allow the accumulation of many variations.

Some of us may deal with toxins/drugs quite well (perhaps a good
sitation for toxins but a not-so-good situation for drugs where
one might want effects to last longer).  Some of us may have the
reverse situation (poor toxin removal but drugs are more effective).

Its a real mess at this time.

Are you then an absolutist or do you speak in terms of probabilities as

Obviously you reduce risk to mutagens  to the degree that is possible given 
all the facts and the full context.  But it is a bit of a shortcut to simply 
say X causes cancer.  No matter what we do we can never eliminate all 
mutagens.  Thus if we want to guarantee freedom from cancer we need to go for 
the lowest level mechanisms that are in part kicked into action by mutagens.  
We need ways to boost the body's defensese and to dependably detect and 
eliminate malignant cells.   I disagree that any of the above necessarily 
requires reworking the "political economy".   It does require some new 
technology.

Robert is doing a great job explaining the current undestanding of
cancer and why it is so hard to combat; I wish I had the time to
be more expansive myself but I have a small conference coming up.
All I have time to say right now is that there is a way out of the
"mess" that Robert describes, which is outlined at:

   http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/SENS3.htm

Questions and challenges are of course welcomed, but answers may be
delayed until Sept 24th.

Well, my understanding is that cancer is a class of multi-causal
diseases.  In general, it seems that two gene mutations are necessary to
cause any given cancer: one in an oncogene, the other in a tumor
suppressor gene.  There are a variety of factors that can cause either,
including inheritence, behavior, environmental factors (presence of
carcinogens), and infectious agents (e.g., H. pylori seems to be
implicated in stomach cancer).

To some extent, yes, but as others have pointed out it's nearly
impossible to remove all toxins AND I think Robert pointed out that a
certain amount of toxic stress might actually be good for the body
because it ramps up defense mechanisms.

Also, I would point out that two other things I didn't see mentioned in
this discussion -- or I missed them, so forgive me for echoing someone
else's words unwittingly.  One is that carcinogens are both human-made
and non-human made.  So merely saying reductions in human-made
pollutants ("pollutants" already being kind of a subjective term; to me,
burning incense in my domicile would be considered polluting it, while
many of my friends love doing that in theirs) would reduce cancer, this
leaves alone increases in natural ones.

The other is that diagnostic capabilities have increased over time.  So,
it's possible that cancer rates might have been under-reported in the
past.  If, say, someone who was poor died in India in 1800 CE or even
BCE at the age of 70, would anyone have know what caused her death?
Yeah, if there was a big cancerous lesion on her tongue, maybe.

Also, people have perhaps become too paranoid about these things.  I
have a close friend who won't take dental X-rays because he fears
getting cancer.  Now I don't know the statistical correlation between
dental X-rays and cancers, but the funny thing is neither does he!:@
So, he's basically just making an emotional choice here -- which might
cost him.  (How?  Well, a dental X-ray might identify certain mouth
problems that can be easily corrected.  Some of these actually might be
cofactors in causing heart disease and even cancers.)

Cheers!

Next year you might want to mark August 27th as the day
you dodged a bullet and offer a toast/sacrifice/etc. to
whatever you think protects humanity.

Why?

Because on August 27th, 1998, a solar flare from the
magnetar SGR 1900+14, which is 45,000 light years away
from us, hit the atmosphere of the Earth and caused a
significant amount of atmospheric ionization [1].  It
is good that it it is 45,000 light years away as only
a small amount of the energy released hit the Earth.

How much energy is this?

Well according to the article a magnetar flare can release
~10^44 ergs.  As it turns out, that is precisely the amount
of energy Dyson predicted was required to disassemble the
planet Jupiter [2].  Had it been significantly closer one
couldn't have extracted the the mouses from our dead hands.

Why?

Because there would probably no longer be mouses or hands.

The part that concerns me is that we have little knowledge
of how many magnetars may be much closer to us.

So in terms of the galactic hazard function -- it looks like
one can add magnetars to Gamma Ray Bursts as a significant
component of the hazard function.

Dan, X-rays are an ionizing radiation and so are clearly harmful --
but one has to put them in context with respect to solar flares,
radon exposure, cosmic and X-rays from Gamma Ray Bursts and Magnetars,
how much one flys reducing atmospheric shielding, etc.  I have yet
to see a good evaluation of the relative risks.

The way I try to deal with X-rays is try to overload on antioxidants
slightly prior to the X-ray.  So that means loading up on Vitamin-E
for a few days to a few weeks prior.  Vitamin-C might also be helpful
but it depends on ones iron level -- the more iron one has available
the more likely that Vitamin-C may act as a pro-oxidant rather than
an anti-oxidant.  Alpha Lipoic Acid and glutathione may also help
but I'm not sure we know enough about them currently.  We also don't
know enough about how external anti-oxidants impact the production
of internal anti-oxidants and whether one can "overload" the
oxidant sensing systems for a few days prior to having an X-ray.
(Thus allowing one to have greater defenses for a short period
before the system balances the internal production of anti-oxidant
molecules/enzymes with external supplementation.)  It is my personal
opinion that short-term overloading may be feasible.

Vitamin E appears to be relatively non-toxic (up to several thousand
IU per day) -- so you can push the amount you consume for short periods
and probably be reasonably safe (compared with some other Vitamins,
esp. Vitamin A, where excessive consumption may be harmful.)

I did not argue that they were not harmful.  My point was that a dental
X-ray has benefits too, such as in diagnosing tooth decay and even gum
disease.  One has to evaluate getting them with respect to both the
risks and the benefits.  The same is true of many other known harmful
things, such as other X-rays and other medical procedures.  In some
cases, they might not be worth the risk -- as in full body scans in
people who have no symptoms for any diseases.  The exposure to
X-radiation in those seems out of proportion to the benefits.
(Hopefully, as scanning technology becomes better, this can be
mitigated.  I'm only talking about the state of the art now in the
popular full body scans.)

Also, regarding my friend, he did not make his choice based on a review
of the data.  It's sort of like he's decided not to ever fly in planes
because planes can crash.

Cheers!

I don't see how it's even controversial.  We know that extended 
exposure to carcinogens increases the risk of cancer.  We know that 
we're dumping carcinogens into the environment at an alarming rate.  We 
know that we're living longer.

The two combine to form the positive statement:

"If we want to live longer and not get cancer, we should reduce the 
number of carcinogens in our environment."

I admit that there is the possibility of reshaping the human genome to 
be less susceptible to cancer-causing agents, but doubt that that will 
be accomplished in a way that's going to help ME and YOU and/or "most 
people".  Remember, "most people" can't afford health insurance.

As far as I know there simply is no fact of the matter as to "what will 
happen next."  To understand this consider the possibility that the 
truth value of

"Robbie will have another child in a year" is neither T or F.

The epistemological problem of predicting the behavior of very 
large-scale biological systems is notoriously difficult.  Consider my 
Grandmother who smoked for the middle 70 years of her now 
84-and-kicking years. We may get better at it, but the point remains, 
we simply don't know what's going to happen.  The most probable 
explanation for that fact is that there just is no matter of fact about 
what is GOING to happen (at least that seems obvious to me, I know 
there are alternative points of view).

JR Lucas has a great book on the modalities of future-tense statements 
"The Future" it presumes to solve all of the determinist "word games" 
with the simple observation that the past is fixed, the future merely 
possible.

Well, there are a few options: we could rework the political economy so 
that we don't dump billions upon billions of gallons of carcinogens 
into our environment every year OR we could rework the human genome so 
that it's less susceptible to carcinogens.

You can take your pick about which is MORE LIKELY to reduce the cancer 
rate.    Personally, I think that while medical solutions may be 
forthcoming, they certainly aren't HERE and that even when they are, 
their likelihood of solving the problem GLOBALLY is pretty slim.  
That's just an opinion based on the years and years of semi-successful 
treatment of cancer.  Obviously, from above, I just don't think there's 
any fact of the matter.  Instead, there is our own subjective 
assessment of "What makes sense."  If we wanted to be smart, we'd move

Well, so far I've been called a lot of bad things, now we can add 
"combative and one-tracked" to liberal, etc.  How does your remark 
answer the question at hand:

Should we or should we not stop dumping toxins and known carcinogens 
into our environment?  Wouldn't that go a long way toward reducing our 
exposure to said carcinogens?  Isn't that LIKELY to reduce our risk of 
cancers?

As for me being one-tracked, this particular thread was the smallest, 
tiniest, most insignificant point I made in a response to what I 
thought was actually an interesting and important question.

If I wasn't so immune to social pressure, I'd think you guys were 
picking on me because I'm not an MD.  But even a non-MD knows that 
reducing exposure to carcinogens is a good idea, but that it's only 
"LIKELY" to prevent cancer.

Agreed.  "Some amount of toxins" are a good idea.  But then Robert also 
seems to be claiming that eating a nice apple would probably do the 
trick in that regard.  I don't think he's suggesting that we should all 
be ingesting large amounts of aluminum, cesium and asbestos.  Are you?

My point is simply that to reduce the overall amount of carcinogens and 
known toxins in our environment is a GOOD IDEA if we want to extend our 
lives and our chances for survival.  I still don't see why this is even 
slightly controversial.

I thought that skin and gut cells needed the capability to divide 
indefinitely.  I.e., that unpredictable environmental insults might 
cause any particular skin or gut cell to need to divide an extremely 
large number of times, sufficiently numerous that teleomere maintenance 
was necessary.

If so, then *SOME* cells had better not have their ability to regenerate 
teleomeres knocked out.

Aubrey, my readings right now suggest that the ALT pathway for
the extension of telomeres (or at least part of the ALT pathway)
involves homologous recombination repair between telomeres.  It
makes sense since telomeres are essentially identical and so
it is difficult to prevent short telomere from using a longer
telomere as a repair substrate.  If so it is going to be hard
to deal with -- one has to suppress homologous recombination
DNA repair in pre-cancerous cells.  Not impossible mind you but
pretty darn difficult.  One would presumably turn down the
ability to do homologous recombination repair system as the
telomeres shorten.  But I suspect there will be tissues where
that has a significant negative impact (in terms of cell replacement
capacity).  One of the problems is that we don't fully understand
the degree to which telomere extension needs to be tuned
for specific tissues based on their cell division rate.
I suspect the optimal balance between telomere extending
and shortening is not attained in many tissues.

So while I agree that there may be a partial path out of the "mess",
I think we still have a lot more to learn.

On a positive note, though I can't discuss it, Juvensa may be on
the path towards a "homologous recombination-based gene therapy"
approach that may be workable.  If that plays out in a successful
way you will have a much greater toolbox to work with.

Replacement of epithelial cells varies from tissue to tissue --
in part depending on how difficult the environment they are
exposed to is -- air is a less difficult environment than say
stomach acid.  Replacement times of the surface area cells can
be as little as 3 days or as much as a few weeks I believe.

> If so, then *SOME* cells had better not have their ability to regenerate

My impression is that the stem cells in epithelial tissues have a limited
ability to regenerate their telomeres.  Whether this is "optimal"
is questionable.  This may explain why wound healing becomes slower
with age or why it becomes more difficiult to absorb sufficient
nutrients as one ages.

Too much telomere regeneration probably ups the cancer rate.
Too little telomere regeneration has various negative consequences
as the cells become senescent and cease to renew themselves.
One ends up caught between a rock and a hard place.

Ah, but as the saying goes, "there's the rub".  I don't have any problem
with the removal of mutagenic substances generally deemed universally
harmful.  Asbestos might be a good example.  But with many other toxic
substances the level to which one "should" be exposed (to maintain optimal
defense mechanisms) is genome specific.  So exposure levels that help one
person in terms of extending lives might actually harm someone else.

So long as we continue to remove pollutants from our environment and
cancer rates continue to decline I think we are on the right track.
(Though it takes some time (decades) for the epidemiology to provide
good indicators for this.)  You can see this playing out currently
in lawsuits against IBM for exposing semiconductor workers to hazardous
chemicals about 15 years ago.  But I'm somewhat doubtful that a
"zero" exposure rule would be the best strategy for the average
individual.

Ultimately one needs to look at each carcinogen, its mechanism of action
and then have a good feeling for how it interacts with the detoxification
gene set (as well as the DNA repair set, the nutrient absorption gene set
and probably other gene sets) of the "average" individual.  Ultimately one
has to come back to the idea that "all persons are created equal" and
realize that it simply isn't true -- so one has to give up rational
principles that are based on that idea.

So we're in agreement.  Both you and I agree that stopping the constant 
dumping of toxic and carcinogenic materials into our environment is a 
good idea and that this dumping of toxic and carcinogenic materials has 
its roots in our economic/political system which is currently 
preventing us from doing THAT.

For the record, I never proposed the "zero" exposure rule.

Nor did I ever say that "all persons are created (immunologically) 
equal".

I'm talking about OBVIOUS things like dumping heavy metals and known 
poisons into water supplies, storing radioactive waste near humans, 
billowing smog into the air second after-second, etc.

Best,

Robbie

PS - it is ABUNDANTLY CLEAR that there are many, many people who know 
more than I do about the underlying physical causes of cancer and 
disease.

2 points:

Cancer is caused by toxins.  People who are around toxins are highly likely 
to have cell mutations, causing cancer.  People who inhale and/or touch 
certain toxic material will most likely get cancer. The toxic substance 
does not have to be extreme heavy metals or poisons.  Mild toxic substances 
will do the trick. The issue is usually the type of toxin and the range of 
exposure, rather than the percentage of toxicity.

Cancer does have a genetic link.   People whose 
parents/grandparents/siblings have cancer have a higher rate of getting cancer.

The bad news is that just because you have one type of cancer, it does not 
mean that you will not contract a different type of cell mutation.  So, a 
person could get cancer from a toxic substance and get another type of 
cancer from an inherited gene.

Stress plays a minor role in getting cancer, but a major role in overcoming it.

That looks like a strong approach. Tough work!

There seemed to be a concern that the cells, which have the telomerase and
ALT pathways knocked out (through unspecified means? How are they originally
knocked out?), might turn those pathways back on (although this is
addressed). Why not target the immune system against telomerase, at least,
as in this article:
http://psa-rising.com/medicalpike/vaccine-telomerase-ucsd-april2000.htm

This may in fact be what the intention is; get the immune system to kill off
all cells with telomerase turned on (ALT dealt with seperately), then
periodically reintroduce stem cells with telomerase off but with long
telomeres.

Robocop spy-cam speaks for itself
By Andrew Johnson

14 September 2003

It is the snooper that speaks before anyone has the chance to step out of 
line.

A cross between Big Brother and Robocop, it barks orders at would-be 
vandals, graffiti artists and drug users.

British Transport Police and two local authorities are experimenting with 
revolutionary cameras which can spot when people are not where they should be.

The Flash Cam 530 takes its photographs with an intense flash that can 
read a car number plate in the pitch dark from 100 yards, and then issues 
a stern 15-second Robocop-style spoken instruction to leave the area.

Steve Galinsky, who started importing the cameras from America in May, 
said: "We have seven on trial across the country. Easington Council in 
County Durham is using them to stop fly-tipping. We've had no prosecutions 
so far, but no fly-tipping either."

British Transport Police has three cameras, two standing guard at 
Worcester's Shrub Hill station and one in Leamington Spa station, to stop 
graffiti vandals.

There is another at the memorial site to the victims of last year's rail 
crash in Potters Bar. Would-be vandals are told: "This is a dedicated 
memorial site. Please leave now. Your photograph has been taken and may be 
used to prosecute you."

In Camden, north London, drug addicts hear: "Please leave now if you have 
no business in this area. Your photograph has been taken and if you are 
conducting an illegal activity you will be prosecuted."

Mr Galinsky said Scotland Yard was in discussions over the cameras being 
installed throughout London. Westminster Council is considering a trial in 
central London.

Understood.  This was my incorrect extension of the direction in
which I thought you were taking things.

*But* there are cost-benefit tradeoffs.  If we simply take asbestos
(as perhaps a bad example) -- I've never seen any analysis of how
many cases of cancer (or deaths) it may have caused vs. how many
lives it may have saved (reduced numbers of fires, slower burn
times allowing greater opportunities to escape, etc.).  One could
do a similar analysis with the analysis of reductions of pollutants
in water supplies -- but one has to balance this with increased
costs of water supplies that might prevent parents from providing
their children with proper nutrition.  One sees the debate perhaps
most with so-called "organic" food.  Producing organic food is
in many cases less productive than using historic agricultural
methods that may involve the use of pesticides.  Result -- the
food is more expensive.  So I can buy organic produce but I
may not be able to afford a car with side impact air bags.

If one is being rational about this one has to think about the
tradeoffs.  There is a very big question as to whether we have
already driven the requirements (in the U.S.) for minimal exposure
to carcinogens so low that in most cases the costs significantly
exceed the benefits.  There is still a big debate that current
carcinogen exposure standards are extrapolated from very high dose
exposures and that because of the way DNA repair regulation works
there may be minimal danger from low dose exposures.

The rules are also inconsistent.  Though we *know* that natural
radon exposure in a number of areas is responsible for a significant
fraction of lung cancers -- there are not any mandated laws requiring
those houses be destroyed.  You also don't see laws saying one cannot
build homes above certain altitudes due to increased cosmic ray
exposure.

Agreed.  This was my pointing out that there may not be universal
solutions.

In the U.S. the water standards are very strict.  I get a report every
year from the city of Seattle with the results of their continual
analysis of the water.  People who have individual wells and who have
to deal with the content of the groundwater are perhaps at greater risk.
Low level exposure to radioactive waste may actually be beneficial for
the DNA repair activation reasons I have outlined.  The risk of the
theft of such material for its use in a dirty bomb is probably a much
greater risk at this time.  The primary sources of smog at this
time are probably automobiles and coal power plants.  In these cases
I would tend to agree that a little bit more economic and political
pressure might result in improvements.  But we (in the U.S.) have
significantly improved things from the decades where high quantities
of acid rain were poisoning our lakes.  The real populations at risk
are in the 3rd world countries where environmental quality standards
are much lower than those in the U.S.  Here one does see the air pollution
standards in California slowly turning the screws on the automobile
manufacturers.  So the big remaining problem would appear to be G.B.
attempting to relax regulations on the coal power plants -- but the states
in New England are taking him to court on that one I believe.

So overall I think things are not as bad as they may appear at first
glance.

Regarding cancer rates and exposure to toxins, I recently came across an 
article in Scientific American looking at the phenomenon of hormesis and 
how the developing understanding of it may play a role in better 
appreciating the body's ability to deal with toxins. There was a question 
raised in the article about how such research, admittedly ongoing, may 
influence public policy vis-a-vis environmental regulation, etc.

I am wondering what others may think of such research and its prospects for 
both better understanding the processes by which we succumb to accrued 
damage of toxic exposure (resulting, I would suppose, in cancers of various 
kinds, amongst other conditions) and for formulating wise policy to guard 
against it where possible.

I had originally learned of hormesis a while ago in a discussion of 
Rosalind Yallow's work on radiation exposure, in the book "I Wish I'd Made 
You Angry Earlier", and had long wondered what ongoing research had learned 
about it since then. I had intended to ask Peter Doherty for his view on 
such matters last Friday, but was feeling a bit blah and missed attending 
the function he was at.

Here's the link to article:

That's probably a minor factor, given that our ancestors survived quite
happily without modern industrial chemicals in their environment for
millions of years.

There is, however, a far more important cost tradeoff, which is polution vs
technology/progress. Removing the toxins is a good idea in isolation, but
remember that they are there for a reason; they are the result of someone
doing something. In many cases judgement should go toward removal of the
toxin (eg: dioxins?), but in other cases it is less clear. 

For example, look at the growing problem of heavy metals (I think) leaking
out of old computers, and the resulting toxin levels in the environment
(ground water?). To have not made this mess, we very well probably would
have had to significantly slow down the computer revolution of the 80s and
90s, if not forego it altogether. Would it have been worth it?

Many on this list ask an unfashionable question about the use of nuclear
power; namely, are the waste problems caused, and the the safety concerns,
bad enough to have warranted the backlash and subsequent avoidance of it?
What price did we pay for not having the cheap power that it could have been
providing us all these years?

This, imo, is the big question about pollution. I'm no supporter of
pollution, by any means, but I don't think it's a dichotomy; theres a
multidimensional space of the various costs involved, and the evolving
solution is a constant dance between two much restriction and two much
environmental degradation/poisoning. 

Also, as to removal of toxins being a good idea, all things being equal, I
think we can say that about a lot of things (exercise, diet, research money,
etc). Finite resources/effort will be applied to all these things in the
end. For what it's worth, I think the settings are probably wrong in some
areas (research dollars, for instance). Removal of toxins may be underfunded
too, I'm not sure.

We've discussed cow-tipping before on this list, but fly-tipping is a new
atrocity, totally disorienting the hapless creatures. I used to think
swatting, spraying and wing-tearing was bad enough, but this is a national
disgrace.

I think you give the fly tippers too little credit, Damien. It's extremely
delicate work. Sneaking up to a critter with that many eyes, even when it is
asleep, is incredibly difficult.

Not that I know from experience, of course. :-|

I usually tip flies between 15% and 20%, which is not enough to knock them 
over.  I don't do so furtively, either, as the flies have usually been 
tipped to my presence.  Of course, tipping flies 20% may make them a bit 
tipsy, but this is only tipical.

I've been busy today RSS-enabling more content at the Longevity Meme. That
may be of interest to some of you who are moving away from e-mail and
towards RSS aggregators:

http://www.longevitymeme.org/syndication.cfm

(And incidentally added web access to past newsletters:
http://www.longevitymeme.org/newsletter/).

In the brief months since I last touched RSS development, it seems that I've
lost my references to centralized RSS aggregation engines in a sea of
decentralized RSS applications. Google isn't a good tool for telling the
difference by website, unfortunately. Since I really should go add my new
feeds to the few centralized ones that remain, I'd appreciate pointers from
those more in the know.

I know it is probably unwise for me to post this.  But it may
be useful for people in the U.S. as well as foreign observers
of U.S. politics to understand one aspect of the U.S. political
arena.

Why is this important?  Because the politics are driving decisions
that may seriously impact the funds available in the future for
everything from the National Nanotechnology Initiative to DARPA
funding of AI research to biotech and health related research.

So, save a copy of:

September 14, 2003
The Tax-Cut Con
By PAUL KRUGMAN
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print

It is long, but perhaps one can sit down, read it and think about
some points it makes and some potential consequences.

Mind you, I am not as opposed to deficit funding as I once was --
but I want to see clear evidence that the funds will primarily
be being used to accelerate technology development that will bail
us out.  I'm not sure that I see that at this time.

Interestingly, if one looks at the U.S. "war on terrorism" as well
as the Columbia disaster -- both appear to be costing out at a rate
slightly in excess of $50 million per human life lost.  It would be
interesting to compare that with "standard" values of human life
that courts use for wrongful death suits which I would guess are
typically an order of magnitude less.

I suppose I should post the obligatory warning about Krugman; anything he
writes should be viewed with extreme suspicion from an economic point of
view. Have a look at:

As a part of my ongoing and semi-voluntary colonization of useful networking
services, I was just dragged into tribe.net. It's sort of like the bastard
child of ryze.com and friendster.com, run through a good prep school and
given a nice haircut. The selling point for a group of people migrating from
friendster.com is the designed-in ability to create "tribes" of people;
something that friendster frowns on within their interface (but need to
start supporting before they lose their head start). So with this in mind, I
put together the "Transhumanists" tribe:

http://transhumanists.tribe.net

Those of you who participate in these things, feel free to jump on in. (That
means you ragged-trousered transhumanists on friendster too).

(And I should note that Mike Lorrey seems to have created Transhumanism on
friendster, joining the ranks of other concept avatars in the system, with
the note: "Hi everyone, I want to tell you about my friend Transhumanism!
Transhumanism is ... one hot babe. She's hip, cool, techie, and 1337 as all
4377. She has an open marriage thing going on, and is looking for more
partners in developing emergent phenomena, exploring the universe, and
transcending physical limits." Sorry, had to share.
http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=600401).

It has to be said, watching the evolution of these things is fascinating.
It's the scrabbling lizards on a glass wall stage; lots of momentum and
action, but not much purchase yet in the climb to something truly new. I'm
fairly sure there's something very cool, transforming and radically new
hiding somewhere in this whole six degrees and networking service thing, but
it remains to be seen what that actually might be.

Wrong.  The key point is that just swapping bits of DNA between
telomeres can do very little to stave off cell senescence and/or
death (always death in the case of cancer cells because they have
already overcome the senescence response in order to reach crisis
in the first place), because all it does is ensure that one short
telomere doesn't trigger death prematurely.  For indefinite (or
even much extended) cell division you need DNA replication.  DNA
repair involves a tiny bit of replication, but only a tiny bit.

Wrong.  The reason we know it's wrong is just that ALT is evidently
as hard to activate as telomerase is, even in cells like skeletal
muscle satellite cells where telomerase is fabulously well shut down.
So, even though at this point we don't know what aspects of our DNA
repair machinery are involved in ALT, we can actually be reasonably
confident that at least some of that machinery is very well turned
off in normal cells.  That's not as surprising as it sounds, because
it doesn't imply anything for the activity of DNA repair generally:
the get-out is that there are many genes that have no constitutive
role, and only operate in unusual cells, e.g. in meiosis.  Meiosis
is the best bet, in my view, for a process some of whose machinery
is essential for ALT.

All true, but irrelevant if we get WILT to work.

All true.  (I know plenty about that work of course as I am on the
Juvensa scientific advisory board.)

One of the issues is that many would consider it impolite to be included 
in someone else's network w/o their permission or knowledge. There are 
some ways around that.

I see aggregators as a social singularity precursor. Especially when 
most folks have wearables with always-on internet connections. I see 
such a human-centered singularity as possibly quite more desirable than 
a technological singularity obtained thru nanotech and/or friendly AI. 
In any case it might better prepare us for such advances.

Part of it boils down to, what do I want, and what do I have to trade. 
Remember that comedy plot, used more than once in M*A*S*H, where the 
folks need some part, and the only place to get it is thru someone who 
won't trade it except for what he wants. During course of the show they 
produced a Rube Goldberg-esque multipart trade. With aggreators, it 
seems possible that such could be accomplished almost automatically, and 
on a world-wide scale.

Another possible application would be stranger identification. In any 
community crowd, you won't know everybody, but chances are that someone 
in the crowd will know someone that you don't. Those unknown by anyone 
in the crowd could be quickly identified by aggregating the crowd's 
collective identifications. This doesn't mean they would be a criminal, 
but in certain high-risk areas they might be stopped and checked for 
bombs or something.

If you were to prove that for any N sequential samples from this pot, the
probability of getting a sequence with M red chips and (N - M) white chips
is a constant regardless of the ordering of white and red chips, it would
prove both constant P(Wk) and constant P(Wj|Wk), j != k.

The above property, that an outcome containing M red chips and (N - M)
white chips has a constant probability regardless of the ordering of red
and white chips, is known as exchangeability.

Suppose the sequence is exchangeable.  No matter how long the sequence
goes on, P(W1) and P(W1&W2) is constant, since this is computed in the
first two draws.  P(W2) = P(W1), because P(R1&W2) + P(W1&W2) = P(W1&R2) +
P(W1&W2).  P(W1&W2) = P(W2&W3) because P(W1&W2&W3) + P(W1&W2&R3) =
P(R1&W2&W3) + P(W1&W2&W3).  The same holds for arbitrary P(Wi) and P(Wj|Wk).

Actually, if a sequence is exchangeable, we can swap any i, j != k in the
joint distribution, and properties such as P(Wi), P(Wi|Wk), P(Wi&Wk), and
so on, will remain constant.

To show that the sequence is exchangeable, consider any R, W of initial
red and white chips in the bowl, with a total number of chips N.  The
probability of the sequence RWWRR is then given by:

R    W    W+1   R+1   R+2
- * --- * --- * --- * ---
N   N+1   N+2   N+3   N+4

Changing the ordering of the R and W chips will not change the total
factors in the numerator and the denominator.

The entire proof is exactly analogous to the case of a bowl where, instead
of *adding* one chip of the color drawn, we draw a chip and discard it.
If we started with 5 red and 3 white chips, and drew a white chip, we
would be down to 5 red and 2 white chips, and so on, until we ran out of
chips after 8 rounds.  Obviously, the probability of drawing a red or
white chip on any round N is the same as on round 1, if you have no
information about the chips previously drawn; and the probability of
drawing two red chips on any two rounds is the same; and the probability
you drew a red chip on round 2 if you drew a red chip on round 4, is the
same as the probability of drawing a red chip on round 2 if you drew a red
chip on round 1, since in either case there is one less red chip to go
around.  You can imagine the chips "scattered" over N holes,
simultaneously, rather than being placed in sequence - this is what it
means for the sequence to be exchangeable.  Swapping the labels of "round
1" to "round 3" has no effect on how the chips land in the holes.

If you start out with R red chips and W white chips, and draw without
replacement, the probability of getting a particular sequence is:

R    W    W-1   R-1   R-2
- * --- * --- * --- * ---
N   N-1   N-2   N-3   N-4

Which is what makes this distribution exchangeable:

> Evil Hint #3:
> 
> The classical version of the problem has a bowl where we sample without replacement - take the chip, and throw it away.  Suppose there are M red chips and N chips.  If you don't know what you got on the first round, the probability of getting a red chip on the second round is still M/N.  The probability of getting a red chip on the second round, given that you got a red chip on the fourth round, is just (M-1)/(N-1), since there's one less red chip to go around.  We can think of sprinkling the chips over holes, instead of drawing them in successive rounds, and it doesn't matter if you swap around the labels on the holes.
> 
> The evil version of the bowl, instead of running out of the chips already sprinkled, has more and more of them, like a P2P file-sharing network. But that doesn't change anything important. 

The math is also not affected if you instead add three chips of the color
drawn, or if you subtract two chips of the color drawn, and so on.

Christian Rovner has an interesting way to visualize this, which is that
the drawing procedure always leaves the bowl the same shade of pink
afterward.  If you remove the chip drawn on each round, you're removing a
chip with a 3/8 probability of being white, from a bowl with a 3/8
probability of producing white chips.  If you add a chip of the color
drawn on each round, you're adding a chip with a 3/8 probability of being
white, to a bowl with a 3/8 probability of producing white chips.  If you
know that you drew a white chip on the first round, then on future rounds
with unknown draws you're adding chips with a 4/9 probability of being
white.  And so on.  It doesn't matter whether you *know* that the pot has
5 red and 3 white chips, as on the first round, or if you're working with
some probability distribution of mixes that add up to 3/8; it's all the
same shade of pink.  The drawing procedure leaves the pinkness unchanged,
both for the main distribution, and for any differently shaded
subdistributions that you want to consider separately.

See also Chapter 3 of E.T. Jaynes's "Probability Theory:  The Logic of
Science".  (I did not get the problem from there; I made it up after
reading it.  Though I am sure it is not original.)

Thanks to Robert and to Reason for their submissions.
As Robert's cautionary note cautions, this is a
volatile subject, so all and sundry should be
respectful and wary and practice safe sects.  Reason
as ever is the soul of, er, reason, ...and moderate
discourse.  Love youse guys.

Two comments if I may.  

>From Krugman's piece we have the following:

"The starting point of supply-side economics is an
assertion that no economist would dispute: taxes
reduce the incentive to work, save and invest." 

to which I direct your particular attention.  In
support of the above, the paragraph finishes with:

"A businessman who knows that 70 cents of every extra
dollar he makes will go to the I.R.S. is less willing
to make the effort to earn that extra dollar than if
he knows that the I.R.S. will take only 35 cents. So
reducing tax rates will, other things being the same,
spur the economy."

If this is something "that no economist would
dispute", (I would suppose because the data in support
of this assertion is rock solid, unrelenting, and
without flaw, though I've not seen this data
personally) nevertheless, allow me, for the sake of
balance, to take the opposing view.

If you tax an (over)achiever, and thus reduce his
income--take him down a notch from that to which he
has become accustomed--shall he not then, in
conformity with his nature, resolve to redouble his
efforts, work harder, recover that which he has lost,
and strive as before for ever greater glory, and still
ever greater glory after that?  Camels and capitalists
aren't quitters.  Rather they persevere right up to
the moment when their back snaps. No?

Thus, it follows that more taxes on the rich, and more
taxes after that, and after that, motivates
achievement and drives the engine of productivity.
(and if there are no economists to support this view,
perhaps that reflects a uniformity of obeisance to the
swinishly over-rich, would that I were one.)

In support of this theory of high taxes to optimize
productivity, I give you two examples: Alabama, with
low taxes and low everything else (as cited in the
Krugman piece) and California--or as Spike is wont to
call it, "Taxifornia"--which is a virtual utopia of 
prosperity arising from hyper-achievement, despite (or
perhaps in consequence of) a near-crushing tax burden
(and traffic hell/road rage/fremen training regimen to
make international terrorism seem a case of hiccups by
comparison).

PS: I'm not arguing in favor of taxation or other
Arrakis-style hardening, but rather for a balanced
view on the theoretical front.

Best, Jeff Davis

"Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who
said it--no matter if I have said it--unless it agrees
with your own reason and your common sense."

It was my understanding that we have plenty of oil buried nebeath our own
land and that we are just using up everyone else's oil to keep from using
our own.
Also, haven't they been saying we are almost out of oil for the past 30
years?
Here's an interesting article stating that some oil basins seem to be
refilling from sources much deeper in the earth suggesting that our current
estimates of the amount of oil available is very low.

Having been brough up with a belief in supply-side economics, it is
difficult for me to accept that people who have more taken from them will
work harder.
BUT. As a salesperson, I do know that I closed more loans when I was making
30% than now when making 70%. I'll have to ponder that for a few days.
I think the largest problem with taxation is how the money is spent. If
people didn't realize that they can vote to give themselves more of other
people's money, we would probably have a society that was much more
productive.

On Mon, 15 Sep 2003, Jeff Davis offered some comments.

I actually found the piece Reason pointed out quite interesting.
I even agreed with many of the points that it made.

> income--take him down a notch from that to which he
> has become accustomed--shall he not then, in

No.  Speaking from a personal basis if the top rates were
at 70% I'd either (a) be devoting a huge amount of energy
to learning how to play golf (a sport I'm rather not fond of) --
because that would be far more interesting than earning only
30% of for each additional increment of time I could devote
to my profession; or (b) spending my free time reading through
the tax code trying to figure out how to avoid those taxes;
or (c) devoting my extra time to political parties attempting
to get the tax rates reduced.

Just as an FYI -- the first company I worked for at the tender
young age of 19 had the largest minicomputer in the city of NY
(larger even than tha largest minicomputer at Bell Labs at that
time).  What was it devoted to?  Clever analysis of the tax laws and
financial analysis so as to shelter the income of its parent
company using "leveraged leases".  The tax reforms of the mid-80's
eliminated those loopholes but the Enron affair shows that there
are still a fair number of people devoting a huge amount of energy
to avoid taxes rather than more productive activies that might
boost economic growth.  The combination of (b) and (c) above,
and the Law of unintended consequences are one of the reasons
that the U.S. tax code is so complex.   And for those readers
who have never seen the tax manuals -- it makes an encyclopedia
look like a set of books for children.

I'm sure Anders could offer a long list of people who have
exited Sweden due to its high tax rates.

So at some point high tax rates shift behavior -- people either
leave the country or devote an increasing fraction of their
productive capacity to the task of avoiding taxes.

Of course, deficit spending eventually requires that one bite
the bullet.  Interest rates eventually go up, currency valuation
goes down, people can less afford to purchase goods from other
countries, other countries have a reduction in foreign currencies
to purchase bonds that support the deficit -- in turn further driving
up interest rates (see my comments a few days ago about China
purchasing large quantities of U.S. Bonds).  Now as the interest
rates go up so do my house and car and business loan costs so
I focus on cheaper housing, how to make my car run another year,
how to cut my business costs by eliminating employees.  One recipe
for a recession.

I've got no problem with cutting taxes -- but you have to do it with
a balanced or nearly balanced budget.  I see no evidence that the
current U.S. administration (executive or legislative) are managing
that responsibly.  The only exemption that I might see for this would
be the onset of the singularity -- and no current econometric models
incorporate that idea that I'm aware of.

Extropy Institute Newsletter
ExI - Changing the Game (September 16, 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Natasha,

Extropy Institute has grown from a groundbreaking 
futurist organization to a worldwide incubator for 
solutions.  Having spent the last 15 years developing 
a grid for transhumanity, ExI is now going in a new 
direction.  In doing so, we've taken the "ism" out of 
extropy and 
heading toward the many cultural, economic and 
technological riddles that wait to be solved and the 
questions that need to be answered. ExI's 
design of thinking systems and solutions for the future 
will unfold over the next year as we approach business 
structures and 
educational systems, probe each others brains and 
nourish the very environment from which we thrive.  
Right now it's time to 
move on to new gardens. Hey, it's an uphill trek - we're 
packing a new website, 
new mission, and new principles, for a new direction.  
Come along - the sky is still blue, Mars is in the 
southwest just before dawn, and tonight Sirius will 
shine brightly in reflection of our deepest 
desires.

CONGRATULATIONS to DAVID McFADZEAN!  ExI's 
Directors 
elected David McFadzean to the board.  David has 
contributed enormous Internet savvy and strategic 
business development to ExI and we decided that his 
talents are indispensable for our future.

* Principles of Extropy, Version 3.1  (by Max More, Chairman)


WHY DO WE NEED EXTROPIC SOLUTIONS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Human beings achieved "civilization" thousands of years 
ago. Yet we have not shaken off the ancient tyrannies 
that haunt the human condition. We suffer physical and 
emotional sicknesses ending in decrepitude and death. 
The primitive parts of our brain spur us to envy, to 
hate, to despair, and to kill. Our philosophies and our 
religions attempt to express our highest values, yet we 
use them to oppress and control. We use them to crush 
the world's complexity into a simplicity that we can 
clutch like a security blanket for the human condition.

Human ingenuity has created astonishing institutions 
and technologies to remedy these problems. Yet our 
intellectual and emotional limitations often spawn new 
problems from our attempted solutions, while our 
primitive drives find ways to abuse them. The ever-
accelerating pace of change breeds anxiety even as it 
glimmers with hope. Powerful technologies ever more 
rapidly shake up entire cultures and economies as well 
as each individual life. As we continue to experiment 
with technology using legacy brains and antiquated 
strategies, uncertainty and anxiety continue to plague 
us.

Extropy Institute New Website >> http://www.extropy.org/index.htm

ExI's NEW MISSION STATEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extropy Institute sees enormous potential in advanced 
decision making and strategic thinking, coupled with 
emerging sciences and technologies, to quicken 
humanity's resolution of these fundamental problems. 
We aim to gradually but firmly change the rules of the 
game called "being human".

In pursuit of our mission, Extropy Institute assembles 
individuals from diverse domains of expertise. We gather 
these ambitious, daring minds to combine creative and 
executive approaches to expose the fundamental roots 
of our problems. We see this advanced, multi-faceted 
solution-seeking as the best way to create a radically 
better future.

We need not remain slaves to our cultural and 
evolutionary history. For centuries, cultures around the 
world saw human slavery as part of the natural order, 
until they were shown irrefutably otherwise. Likewise 
today, many of us passively accept or stridently defend 
the inevitability of human stupidity, malice, conflict, 
aging, and death. We invite you to participate in our 
mission to connect and cultivate the ingenious and 
intrepid shapers of the future.

NEW! "Extropy-Chat" Email List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the "Extropy-Chat" List.  ExI's new email 
list is launched today.

ExI's email list is the longest running transhumanist 
email list in the world. Now entering its second decade, 
the Extropy-Chat (formerly "Extropians") email list is 
open to ExI members and non-members alike. It is a 
general-purpose discussion forum. The List covers all 
manner of topics over time, and you can search back 
several years through the archives on the Web to find 
previous posts on topics that interest you. We also 
provide a daily digest version for those who prefer 
receiving fewer emails.

Over the years, this List hosted innovative discussions 
on the Internet continuously since 1991. We welcome 
innovative discussions pertaining to scientific, 
technological, philosophical, artistic, economic, and 
social perspectives on the future.

Please be aware that the content of the Extropy-Chat

Principles of Extropy, Version 3.1  (by Max More, Chairman)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An evolving framework of values and standards
for continuously improving the human condition

Prologue: What is the Purpose of the Principles of 
Extropy?

Philosophies of life rooted in centuries-old traditions 
contain much wisdom concerning personal, 
organizational, and social living. Many of us also find 
shortcomings in those traditions. How could they not 
reach some mistaken conclusions when they arose in 
pre-scientific times? At the same time, ancient 
philosophies of life have little or nothing to say about 
fundamental issues confronting us as advanced 
technologies begin to enable us to change our identity 
as individuals and as humans and as economic, cultural, 
and political forces change global relationships.

The Principles of Extropy first took shape in the late 
1980s to outline an alternative lens through which to 
view the emerging and unprecedented opportunities, 
challenges, and dangers. The goal was  and is  to use 
current scientific understanding along with critical and 
creative thinking to define a small set of principles or 
values that could help make sense of the confusing but 
potentially liberating and existentially enriching 
capabilities opening up to humanity.

The Principles of Extropy do not specify particular 
beliefs, technologies, or policies. The Principles do not 
pretend to be a complete philosophy of life. The world 
does not need another totalistic dogma. The Principles 
of Extropy do consist of a handful of principles (or 
values or perspectives) that codify proactive, life-
affirming and life-promoting ideals. Individuals who 
cannot comfortably adopt traditional value systems 
often find the Principles of Extropy useful as postulates 
to guide, inspire, and generate innovative thinking 
about existing and emerging fundamental personal, 
organizational, and social issues.

The Principles are intended to be enduring, underlying 
ideals and standards. At the same time, both in content 
and by being revised, the Principles do not claim to be 
eternal truths or certain truths. I invite other 
independent thinkers who share the agenda of acting 
as change agents for fostering better futures to 
consider the Principles of Extropy as an evolving 
framework of attitudes, values, and standards  and as 
a shared vocabulary  to make sense of our 
unconventional, secular, and life-promoting responses 
to the changing human condition. I also invite feedback 
to further refine these Principles.

        Human beings achieved "civilization" thousands of years 
ago. Yet we have not shaken off the ancient tyrannies 
that haunt the human condition. We suffer physical and 
emotional sicknesses ending in decrepitude and death. 
The primitive parts of our brain spur us to envy, to 
hate, to despair, and to kill. Our philosophies and our 
religions attempt to express our highest values, yet we 
use them to oppress and control. We use them to crush 
the world's complexity into a simplicity that we can 
clutch like a security blanket for the human condition.<p>
        Human ingenuity has created astonishing institutions 
and technologies to remedy these problems. Yet our 
intellectual and emotional limitations often spawn new 
problems from our attempted solutions, while our 
primitive drives find ways to abuse them. The ever-
accelerating pace of change breeds anxiety even as it 
glimmers with hope. Powerful technologies ever more 
rapidly shake up entire cultures and economies as well 
as each individual life. As we continue to experiment 
with technology using legacy brains and antiquated 
strategies, uncertainty and anxiety continue to plague 
us.<p>

            <b>Dear Natasha,</b>
            <p>Extropy Institute has grown from a groundbreaking 
futurist organization to a worldwide incubator for 
solutions.  Having spent the last 15 years developing 
a grid for transhumanity, ExI is now going in a new 
direction.  In doing so, we've taken the "ism" out of 
extropy and 
heading toward the many cultural, economic and 
technological riddles that wait to be solved and the 
questions that need to be answered. ExI's 
design of thinking systems and solutions for the future 
will unfold over the next year as we approach business 
structures and 
educational systems, probe each others brains and 
nourish the very environment from which we thrive.  
Right now it's time to 
move on to new gardens. Hey, it's an uphill trek - we're 
packing a new website, 
new mission, and new principles, for a new direction.  
Come along - the sky is still blue, Mars is in the 
southwest just before dawn, and tonight Sirius will 
shine brightly in reflection of our deepest 
desires.
            <p>CONGRATULATIONS to DAVID McFADZEAN!  ExI's 
Directors 
elected David McFadzean to the board.  David has 
contributed enormous Internet savvy and strategic 
business development to ExI and we decided that his 
talents are indispensable for our future.<p>

            Extropy Institute sees enormous potential in advanced 
decision making and strategic thinking, coupled with 
emerging sciences and technologies, to quicken 
humanity's resolution of these fundamental problems. 
We aim to gradually but firmly change the rules of the 
game called "being human".<p>
            In pursuit of our mission, Extropy Institute assembles 
individuals from diverse domains of expertise. We gather 
these ambitious, daring minds to combine creative and 
executive approaches to expose the fundamental roots 
of our problems. We see this advanced, multi-faceted 
solution-seeking as the best way to create a radically 
better future.<p>
            We need not remain slaves to our cultural and 
evolutionary history. For centuries, cultures around the 
world saw human slavery as part of the natural order, 
until they were shown irrefutably otherwise. Likewise 
today, many of us passively accept or stridently defend 
the inevitability of human stupidity, malice, conflict, 
aging, and death. We invite you to participate in our 
mission to connect and cultivate the ingenious and 
intrepid shapers of the future.<p>

Extropy-Chat Email List  4stars.jpg (Great way to meet very smart people.)

The longest running transhumanist email list in the world. Now entering its
second decade, the Extropy-Chat (formerly "Extropians") Email List is open
to ExI members and non-members alike. It is a general-purpose discussion
forum. The List covers all manner of topics over time, and you can search
back several years through the archives on the Web to find previous posts on
topics that interest you. We also provide a daily digest version for those
who prefer receiving fewer emails.

Be sure to read the List Agreement which is located at
http://www.extropy.org/emaillists.htm
<http://www.extropy.org/emaillists.htm> .

Welcome!

Natasha

Everyone on the extropians list should have received an invitation to 
join the new extropy-chat mailing list. If you didn't get yours, or
accidently deleted it (or if it is sitting in your bulk or spam folder ;)
you can subscribe here too:

http://extropy.org/mailman/listinfo/extropy-chat_extropy.org

Please feel free to contact me if you have any problems or questions.

David
