Yup...he did...

It was almost a SF novel as a matter of fact.  It could be interpreted as 
alternate reality or multiple universe......i beleive it was a sequel to an 
earlier novel called "californio's" or some such......

I dunno if it was ghost written though...never thought of it.....

As the prices of digital storage, computation and bandwidth continue to 
close in on "free" I don't see any form of war being necessary to secure 
your own personal version of reality.  As virtual reality gets less and less 
virtual, and more and more realistic, all you need do is login, tune out and 
turn on.

As Yatima, in Greg Egan's _Diaspora_ found, isolation (even eternally so) in 
a sufficiently compelling virtual environment, just might be a very 
satisfying way to live.

<other thought provoking ideas snipped>

I think some serious thought ought to be given to the honor system / 
shareware paradigm by artists in general, and musicians in particular.  As a 
for instance, I recently Napstered Macy Gray’s excellent album, and am 
enjoying it so much that I’d be *happy* to pay for the album (albeit at a 
steep discount, since I neither have nor want the CD medium or the fancy 
packaging).  I even searched the web looking for a place to purchase the MP3 
version of the album.  (Not surprisingly, no such luck.)

I can hear the artists on the list saying “If you enjoy the album so much, 
why don’t you just pop for the friggin’ CD?!?”  Good question.  Here’s the 
answer:

I am thoroughly enjoying the album *today*.  I expect within a couple of 
months I’ll tire of it.  As of now I own approximately 300 CD’s, of which I 
still listen to about 10%.  The other 270 CD’s, after costing me over 
$3,000.00, offer me little benefit other than taking up space and collecting 
dust in my house.  I would much rather have purchased those albums in MP3 
format (again at a steep discount) and done without the CD medium and fancy 
packaging.  Then I’d be free to delete the album (or most of it, only 
retaining those few songs on each album that I really like) freeing up space 
for the new album by the next artist of the minute.

But nooooooo....., *that* would eat up too much of the recording industry’s 
real cash cow business (manufacturing, packaging and distribution - none of 
which I have any need for).  So my only options are (1) buy the friggin’ CD 
and pay for all the superfluous “value added” hokum that I’d rather do 
without, or (2) Napster the album and be branded a scofflaw.  I chose option 
(1) for the past 20 years.  Frankly my dear, I’m sick of it.  Until there’s 
a viable option (3), I’m sticking with Napster.

Well as with any technology, you have to take the good with the bad.  If you 
plan to wait until there is an *absolutely* safe way to upload you brain 
before you do so, I have a hunch you are going to be waiting a *VERY* long 
time.  In the meantime, those who are willing to accept the risks of the 
technology will inherit the substantial benefits that flow from it.  If you 
are like me, some of your most personal, sensitive and private information 
is stored somewhere on a computer with net access.  If you think that your 
computer is impenetrably secure, you are deluding yourself.

rather than me demanding that you not do so, I’d rather persuade you to 
teach me how to read your mind as well.  That way you have no advantage over 
me.

The above sounds oxymoronish to me.  “Frictionless information” and

If you can think of a way to pull *that* off you may well convince me.  But 
I can’t even begin to imagine how you’d do it.

Here we agree.  I believe that any disclosure of personal information should 
be (and will be) mostly voluntary.  I simply foresee a future where the 
benefits of disclosure will so far outweigh the perceived benefits of 
secrecy that people will eventually be as inclined to conceal their data as 
they would be to hide from their employers the fact that they showed up for 
work and did a great job during the last pay period.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Here is a letter I wrote this morning and sent off to several editors at
various news agencies asking for opinions in the wake of Napster on the
future of intellectual property in an age of cheap duplication.  I did
not mention nanotechnology which is obviously the next logical step of
this paradigm.  I make no apologies for the strong and blunt statements,
they've been on my chest way too long.

--------------------

Intellectual Property law was written at a time when resources were
limited.  The internet allows unlimited copying and duplication of
information at nearly zero cost. People comparing duplication to theft
are plain wrong.  If I were to steel your car,
that would be theft.  After all it would cost you a substantial amount
of money to replace it.  But what if I gained the ability to duplicate
your car at no cost to you?  This would not be theft, because quite
simply your car would still be there!  Yet this argument fails to sway,
because those in power have managed so far to use fictitious
intellectual property ideas to make money off of information.
Understandably this was done in an era when duplication costs were
high.  Now that costs of duplication have fallen close to zero,
intellectual property arguments are loosing their strength.

Which brings us to the crux of the issue -  intellectual propertarians
fear that cheap duplication threatens their ability to make money.
Exactly, and they better get used to it!  That's the nature of advancing
technology.  Their argument is the same as blacksmiths during the 1920's
complaining that the proliferation of the automobile was
putting them out of business, or typists when the copy machine came into
widespread use.  The only difference here is blacksmiths and typists
weren't a very powerful lobby.  The recording and motion picture
industries on the other hand are, with billions of dollars to throw at
the legal system.  They have the might, but it does not make it right.
Remember when they almost killed the VCR?

Their next line of argument is the claim that without financial
incentives made possible by intellectual property protections, the
overall level of creativity will suffer.  This is the most bogus
argument of all.  Can anyone say Linux?!  Linux has been created with
little if any incentive for financial gain,  yet it is by far the most
robust and efficient operating system ever created, clearly superior to
anything that has ever come out of Microsoft 's proprietary model.  That
alone should be sufficient argument that intellectual property does not
produce better software.

Whether we like it or not, the age of abundance is upon us.  Either we
open the flood gates of information and allow everyone to prosper as
cost of goods drop closer to zero.  Or we continue this archaic and
obsolete charade of intellectual property rights, created by the rich
for the rich, paying them exorbitant fees for what in reality costs
next to nothing to reproduce.

How about let’s give the “new economy” a chance to do its thing.  Yes there 
was once upon a time called now when you could only make money by moving a 
commodity that derived its value from the fact that it was in limited supply 
and could not be duplicated without some prohibitive degree of capital 
investment.  But jump ahead to the future called now where people are 
earning money from little more than the fact that they can garner the 
attention of other people.  Yes John and Jane Doe can set up a webcam in 
their home and thousands of people a year will drop by just to take a peek.  
Mr. & Mrs. Doe can then sell ad space, or post MLM links on their site and 
make enough money to more than pay for the computer and high-bandwidth net 
connection.

So sure, there’ll be a lot of low-quality crap floating around where content 
creators are not assured of big bucks from the traditional fancy packaging / 
marketing blitz form of distribution.  But that will just make the high 
quality product that much more enticing (and profitable).  Methinks J.K. 
Rowling could put up her works on the net for download fee of a dollar per 
person per chapter and do quite alright for herself.  Sure some would say 
that she wouldn’t have garnered all the attention in the first place if it 
wasn’t for the marketing machine of big publishing.  But I say there is no 
better marketing machine than the internet, if used properly.  Think Blair 
Witch.  Time will tell...

Amen brother.  Though I agree with much of what you had to say, I am not 
without sympathy to those who create content.  But I do have this to say to 
them: If your craft is not sufficiently compelling to earn you a comfortable 
living without resorting to the archaic and outdated laws of copyright 
protection, perhaps you should bite the bullet and go out and get a day job.

Well, good.  At least your viewpoint is consistent.  I can at least respect
that from an intellectual standpoint.  Of course, from a personal
standpoint, it gives me the heebie jeebies.  I'm simply not into us becoming
one big happy collective, I'm way too autonomous for that.

Yes, yes, of course.  We are all aware that life entails a certain level of
risk.  I don't expect perfect solutions, I'd just like to operate within
acceptable parameters.

Again, this is the hive mind scenario, and as stated I'm very much in favor
of the autonomous agent scenario.  Indeed, I believe that there are
tremendous advantages to a distributed system of discrete agents pursuing
contrasting and collective goals where information is both fluid and
static-- where the left hand does not always know what the right hand is
doing.  This is a bit dualistic, but I have a belief that most bootstraps
are an emergent property of the interference between polar qualities-- in
much the same way as complexity and information increase as one approaches
the nexus between chaos and order.

On the contrary, I believe that such a system would very possible, extremely
stable and self sustaining.  I actually think that we live in this universe
already, with quantum uncertainty (absolute privacy) protecting against
determinism whilst a myriad of collapsing waveforms create the sliver of
stable reality on which we proceed.

Or again, as above, with chaos at one end and order at the other and all
sorts of interesting things in between.  I may not be explaining this well
but it appears obvious to me that without reference points (controlled
information: private nodes) a network of frictionless information rapidly
spirals off into pure chaos.

There is an argument that I will try to dig up for you that theorizes that
we are only intelligent because we don't have complete understanding of our
own intelligence.  Having been an actor for seven years I can certainly
testify from first hand experience that sometimes when you think about
something, you destroy it.  (Again with the uncertainty principle.)



Sorry Zero, this one turned into a bit of a ramble.

I'm sure -someone- out there has an inkling of what I'm getting at here.

Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in very
simplistic terms.  You might not be stealing my music if you copy it, but
you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I have
spent energy producing, then it is clear that we should come to some
arrangement by which I should end up with something that you have spent
energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)

By your argument, it should be legal to counterfeit money.

Uh, why even bother with intellectual property laws if something is really
hard to duplicate?  Intellectual property laws -gain- relevance as a
particular thing becomes easier to copy.  In fact, intellectual property
laws protect... intellectual property, which by definition, has always been
tremendously easy to duplicate.

No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being
replaced by something that did their job better.  That's called progress.
No one has proven that Napster is going to result in better music or that
the removal of copyright is going to result in better drugs, coca-cola,
filmmaking, literature, automobile design, etc.

Hey, Linux is not the only example of something really cool that people have
made without getting paid for it.  There will likely continue to be many
shining examples of what humans will do for free.  And humans will continue
to do really interesting things for free.

Its just that they still have to spend a lot of their time doing things they
get paid for.

And just because an operating system is better when lots of people can get
in there and move things around doesn't mean that, oh, say, a movie will be
better if lots of people can get in there and move things around.

This is the typical misunderstanding by class conflict adherents. If a
liver is worth $10 million on the market, its worth $10 million to
everyone. The only difference between one person and another is that
some can pay for it and others can't. If a liver is only worth $1
million to you when its worth $10 million to others, then it isn't worth
as much to you as to others. If you can beg borrow and steal to get $1
million, getting another $9 million shouldn't be outside the scope of
your moral strictures to obtain by similar methods. UNLESS you are such
a poor economic operator that you are unfit to compete in the economic
habitat.

That being said, lets look at utility. Since most rich people, in the US
at least, are self made, having grown up in humble or middle class
circumstances, they are obviously highly effective generators of wealth
(unless you buy the false premise of socialists that all wealth is
stolen, though from who they can't seem to demonstrate), so by the
market giving them the liver instead of you, who admit that you cannot
generate $10 million in wealth by honest economic means, they are making
best use of that resource to enable them to continue to go on generating
far more wealth in the economy than you ever have. So the system has not
broken down, it has merely proven YOU economically unfit to get a liver
if such are in short supply (and if they were allowed to be bid on like
this).

The anti-GM paranoiacs were CLAIMING that it would be harmful. THis was
their argument against letting it be used in crops. In practice,
however, it has shown no impact upon the Monarch, as the Monarch either
does not regard corn pollen as a normal food, or is not dependent upon
it and can taste the pesticide once they've slightly sampled the pollen,
and thereafter they avoid the corn that smells or tastes that way. Of
course, the media presented the anti-GM argument as if it had
significant science supporting it, which it didn't. All they could show
was that butterflies in the lab that were not allowed to eat anything
but the tainted pollen did die. The fact that lab butterflies were not
given an option demonstrates the bad science inherent in that particular
study.

The idea that one rich person betting badly with $1 million dollars is
somehow worse than 1 million joe sixpacks betting badly with $1 each
boggles the mind with its absurdity...

No, because, at least in this area, at least 1/4 to 1/2 of the people I
know obtain additional training after entering the workforce, on a
continuing basis. Those that don't are not doing so out of ignorance,
but because its not NECCESSARY.

Nor does it need to be. A better question to put to people is what
percent of their current jobs is dependent upon training they received
in college and outside a degree program. I take extension courses
occasionally as the mood strikes. I am not interested in getting a
degree, which I regard to be little more than a union card.

More than 76% of the people who downloaded Stephen King's "The Plant Part I"
actually paid for it.  He made no effort to enforce the payment of the
book - he just promised he'd keep writing installments as long as enough
people paid for it.  Well, apparently they have.

I think it's a great example of profiting from "free" digital information.

Decentralization and exhaustive searching, to my mind, is a logical
impossibility.  This is because there is no master controller.  A master
controller in a distributed network has a bird's eye view of the whole
system.  In a decentralized network, all nodes have a worm's eye view.
No node can see beyond the nodes it is directly connected to.

There may be temporary aberrations where a maker of software (or
protocols) tries to control what users do with the software.  I believe
this is a waste of time.

I had in mind primarily my long review of the vast literature on the
efficiency of markets, "Information Successes of Speculative Markets".
(But also the section you mentioned, and the section on buying policy.)
Compared to other institutions, speculative markets seem to do very well.
This empirical data should count for a lot.

The relevant question to ask of institutions are always comparative:
so how much harm could that millionaire do under other alternative
institutions?  And if certain situations are more of a problem for
certain institutions, then what is the relative frequency of those
problem situations?  That is, how often do rich people go nuts and try
to throw all their money away so as to destroy the world?

No one person has nearly enough wealth to dominate a speculative market;
if other speculators mostly think that one person is wrong, then that
one person just can't substantially influence a speculative estimate.

I predict that the percentage who pay will drop as the novelty wears off.
Has King said what the threshold is below which he won't continue?
My guess is that the percentage who pay will approach that level.

You'd only get a "steep discount" if a substantial part of the costs are
due to the CD medium and the packaging.  What evidence is there that this
is true?  Isn't it well known that CD manufacturing costs are far lower than
the price of the CDs?  The plastic packaging can't cost that much, either.
I don't see why you'd expect a substantial discount purely due to this
difference in distribution.

I agree, this is a fascinating and promising effort.  I hope to see more
technical details on the algorithms used in order to judge how well they
can deliver on their potential, but in many ways it looks like Freenet as
designed by Galt's Gulch (Ayn Rand's fictional hypercapitalist community).

Not only the e-cash angle, I am even more interested in the proposal for
a decentralized reputation system.  People can endorse each other and
operate servers to publish reputation ratings.  Here is a description
from some of their technical documentation:

: Each agent in the system will maintain its own local database of
: reputations, including a list of other agents with which it has
: communicated and information about these conversations. For example,
: if there was a failure sending a message within the system, or if one
: agent tried to cheat another by not delivering information, the parties
: should neither run a fraud detection protocol nor consult a third party
: for resolution. Instead, the agent will lessen the local reputation of
: the other, and complete the desired transaction with a different agent.

This is simple and clean - no fraud resolution protocol; if things don't
work out you publish an indictment of the other person, which will
slightly damage his reputation.  If he gets a lot of such criticism,
his "credit rating" will drop.  All done in a decentralized way.

What has recently struck me is that the RIAA has managed to destroy the
music industry.  If they'd arranged to sell songs for a dollar online,
they might have moved the traditional market into ecommerce, and
cheating would be perceived as evil.  Now, people have the expectation
of free music.  People are used to downloading free music.  Even if the
RIAA eventually gets a clue and moves to correct the mistake, the market
will be divided into unusually ethical buyers and the mass of pirates,
instead of the mass of buyers and the unusually unethical pirates.

Yes, the same thought occurred to me when I read the post saying 'Stephen 
King's plan worked'. Yeah, it wroked, since it was so highly publicized, and 
the timing was right. 

But... weren't you thinking, ok but let's see what happens if you asked the 
Napster traders to voluntarily donate a dollar.. hell even a quarter, let's 
say *directly to the artists* (since everyone seems to think it's OK to rip 
off big companies but not artists), every time they download. What do you 
think would happen?

I wouldn't do it every time I downloaded, but for the songs I wanted to
keep?  Sure!  In a flash!  But the payment would have to be automatic;
I'm not going to spend eight hours finding the email address to send the
Paypal payment to.

I use an application called WebFerret to search a whole bunch of different
search engines, more than dogpile or google do. Its resident on my machine, so I
don't have to wait for the search engine page to load, and it returns a list of
all the pages, their descriptions, etc. in a 'file manager' format, free of ads
and other useless graphics. I think this is the way things are going, where a
user can add any number of search engines to the list that they want their
search app to reference.

He said 75%. First day figures showed that 78% paid. The decrease indicates that
a number of people figured since that 78% was over his 75% minimum, they could
morally download for free. I think what you'll find is book sales like this to
run on a 'telethon'-like basis, where you'll have agressive advocates haranguing
the masses of deadbeats to pay up whenever the percentage drops below 75%. THis
is also indirectly similar to how the Nielsen Ratings System allows the public
to vote on what TV shows they want the networks to make. I imagine that TV show
producers in the future might hold telethons for the production of their TV
shows to reach a certain point before they will be broadcast on the web, etc.

I'm surprised the conspiracy theorists have not commented that since most all
CDs are produced in China, that the Napster suit is obviously done at the behest
of Clinton, who is owned by Chinese business interests... ;)

Actually, it's a great 'instance' of profiting from "free" digital
information.  Ok, so Stephen King can pull off a 76%+ payback rate.  This
doesn't really surprise me.  But the avenues of profit available to the
'stars' of the content generation business are going to be, in general, far
less lucrative to the working masses in the content generation business.
I'm guessing.

You're not paying so much for the packaging of the CD, but the packaging of the
musician, PR-wise. I would venture to bet that neither the artists or the
recording company makes a heck of a lot of 'profit' on the original debut
albums, pumping most of that revinue into promotional costs, building up the
value of the Brand Name 'Macy Gray'. THAT is what you are paying for.

He said that he'd write part 3 (he had already committed to part 2 before
this all began) if at least 75% paid for part 1.  76% paid up front and he
said that more people were sending money in after the fact.

I predict that the percentage who pay will drop as the novelty wears off.
Has King said what the threshold is below which he won't continue?
My guess is that the percentage who pay will approach that level.

"This issue involves overwhelmingly, in the opinion of the government, the
right of children in our society to have the expectation, other things being
equal, of the affection and the care of both a mother and a father," Prime
Minister John Howard said.

I think the key phrase here is "in the opinion of the government."  Screw
the opinions of individuals - especially those of women.

Is there more to this story than meets the eye?  This sounds extremely
insane.

  The person with the highest IQ, Marilyn Vos Savant,
  has a column in the Washington Post magazine Parade
  called "Ask Marilyn." A recent question was if she
  agreed that "the purpose of life is to undertake
  a selfish endeavor to make oneself happy." She
  concludes that the only argument supporting
  that (Randian) view is based on a fallacy:

==================================================
  Washington Post PARADE, 7/30/00, page 11

  ASK MARILYN

  By Marilyn Vos Savant

  QUESTION: Humans have long questioned the purpose
  of their existence. However, I believe the answer
  to this supposed eternal dilemma is relatively
  simplistic: The purpose of life is to undertake
  a selfish endeavor to make oneself happy. Anything
  and everything an individual does--in the long
  term--is solely for this purpose. Would you agree?

  MARILYN: ... you seem to be answering the question,
  "Toward what goal do all humans aim?" In defense
  of your answer, you could argue that even apparently
  altruistic behavior is still undertaken to give
  oneself pleasure. As an example, consider the case
  of Mother Teresa: You could suggest that relieving
  the suffering of India's poorest people made Mother
  Teresa happy herself, and that's why she undertook
  to do so. In short, you could argue that any chosen
  behavior, just by the fact that it is chosen,
  indicates a selfish endeavor. But this is based on
  a logical fallacy called petitio principii (better
  known as "begging the question"), a circular argument
  in which the conclusion also appears as an assumption.

  I can't find any other defense of your answer, so I
  can't agree with it.
=====================================================

  IAN: It seems to follow from Savant's answer that
  the goal toward which all humans aim is NOT selfish
  endeavor to make oneself happy. Where's the evidence?
  What people act with intent not to satisfy themselves?
  Even someone marching along at gunpoint follows orders
  because it satisfies them not to be shot for resistance.
  Even someone killing themselves has concluded that death
  would be more satisfactory of them than life, it's even
  said by some that suicide is selfish.  People engage in
  charitable behavior because it satisfies them and they
  earn social rewards for noble action. Even a masochist
  who acts to hurt himself finds satisfaction in such.
  If I and three others are starving to death in the
  arctic and I kill myself so the others can eat me,
  I did so because it satisfied me to help them.

  If no human action is selfless, how is Savant right?
  If self-satisfaction is not the goal toward which all
  humans aim, then what is the goal of all human action?
  It seems to me that what Savant claims to be a logical
  fallacy is in fact an inherent truism of human action.
  If it isn't a truism, then please identify an action
  and/or goal of a self that is truly 100% selfless.
  Seems to me that identifying such is impossible.

There's several videos and white papers about the technology.  Now that I
think about it, I remember reading about this stuff last year.  So, I
suppose we can all view this as an update.

This looks like a promising treatment/cure for some types of

There was a proposal discussed last week on the coderpunks list (offshoot
of cypherpunks) for embedding e-payment contact information in some of
the MP3 comment fields.  Some discussion can be found at:

As well, perhaps the Mojo project mentioned earlier could evolve to
support this kind of voluntary payment.

afterall, once we perceive the relative happiness payoffs of

Of course. In Australia, it is Parliament that is the sovereign, not the
individual. I won't change the subject, but this is what one should expect from
a government that no longer has anything to fear from the wrath of its subjects.

I think...
All humans act upon, by degree, conscious or unconsciously held desire or 
"impulse", One can predict that some ones consciously chosen desire may not 
necessary increase that ones perception of happiness, but that one is acting 
upon the desire so attempting to achieve the satisfaction of the desire.

The case I read was about GM crops, not pesticides ...

As for 'spores' being 'freed' into the environment, plants do not reproduce
by
'spores', so any greenies telling you that are obviously ignorant. Since
agronomists are aware of the risks, they typically plant a band of crops
around
test fields that cannot cross pollinate with the test plants. THe pollen
only
drifts so far before settling to the ground, where it rots.

OK, spores, pollen whatever ... I'm not a biologist .... but tell me how you
can stop cross-pollination (by wind or insects) by planting a band of crops
around a test field? What self-respecting bee or wasp will be put off by
this?

If they still have to be tested in the field .... how come so much GM soya

I think that until science can ensure that neighbouring crops won't become
pollinated by GM test crops, the environmentalists have a point.

Surely we should err on the side of  caution ...... we just don't know how
large-scale GM cultivation will impact on the environment. The dangers of
H-bombs &c. is all too apparent, but some new technologies might have more
subtle dangers. We are not living in sci-fi fantasy .... if things go wrong
in the world they effect real lives.

	i'm not very familiar with rand's philosophy, but this post
seems self-contained. it appears to me that savant's very point is
that the notion of telic self-gratification is unfalsifiable -- a
truism.


   IAN: If she's saying (let's call it)
   the "selfish rule" is a truism, why
   does she say "I can't agree with it"?



	that is, could i not say the same about ... water? i could say

even if it were true because the happiness of water can not be

   IAN: But we can predict human action
   based on the self-interest principle,
   just as we can predict water action
   based on the "flows down" principle.

human beings have a choice, that we can measure our happiness and

   IAN: An interesting question I'd say
   resolved by the fact that one has a
   choice between a range of actions,
   even if any action chosen is selfish.
   If it is a fact that all self-actions
   are selfish, this no more negates free
   will than the fact that all actions are
   invariably actions would negate free will.
   The fact that one attribute of human action
   is constant doesn't, as I see it, effect the
   free-will hypothesis one way or the other.



afterall, once we perceive the relative happiness payoffs of
various potential actions (the perception lying forever beyond our
will), we can not help choosing the one that maximizes our
happiness. when we see a monotonic choice, occam's razor tells us
that there is a causative link.

	another thought experiment --  what if i said that the goal of all
human actions is to maximize human _sorrow_? this too is unfalsifiable
in the sense that savant pointed out, but somehow it sounds less true.
this seems to indicate that the notion of happiness is not completely
empty, that finally there's is some difference from sorrow. oops
... let me back away from the minefield.

	at the end, i think the notion that people act in order to maximize
happiness is a bit like saying that switches toggle in order to turn on
lights. give up the causa sui, and all the strange loops dissolve.



   IAN: To me, Savant's column appears to dismiss the
   "selfish rule," not say that it's an inherent truth.

I'm not sure why Marilyn Vos Savant and yourself are bothered by the fact
that human 'purpose' is a bootstrap-- it seems particularly fitting to me
that this process should be self referential and self-defined.  Tautology is
only a valid argument against this definition of self-gratification if one
believes in an external, objective source of human purpose.

The only problem with the circularity of this argument (as in all
bootstraps) is that it doesn't reference an objective reality.  However this
is appropriate insofar as one holds the belief that 'purpose' doesn't
reference an objective reality either.

Unfortunately this means that it doesn't say very much.

The LA Times reports the latest front in the battle over copyright
protection: grandmothers who illegally share copyrighted needlepoint
patterns with their friends.

http://www.latimes.com/news/state/updates/lat_needle000801.htm
   
   Sales at the South Carolina design shop Pegasus have dropped as
   much as $200,000 a year--or 40%--since 1997, in part because of such
   swapping, said founder Jim Hedgepath. He and a handful of companies
   and pattern designers are gathering evidence to wage a legal battle
   against the homemakers.

   "They're housewives and they're hackers," Hedgepath said. "I don't care
   if they have kids. I don't care that they are grandmothers. They're
   bootlegging us out of business."

   ...

   Business people are trembling at the prospect that file-swapping
   won't stop at music, videos and needlepoint.

   There are already rumblings that it has spread to knitting and
   crocheting.

   "Where will it end?" wailed Marilyn Leavitt-Imblum, 54, who designs
   needlepoint patterns. "I just don't understand how these [people]
   can stitch a stolen angel and still live with themselves."

The GM crops referred to are varieties of corn and wheat that produces
its own pesticide (much like other plants produce their own pesticides),
thus repelling parasites. In laboratory tests, where monarch butterflies
were given NOTHING else to eat but the GM plants, they did eat them and
did become sterilized and died. Where the butterflies were given a
choice between plants to eat, they avoided the GM plants. The Greens
have not acknowledged this fact, and have demonstrated a rather unique
case of selective literacy and memory.

Well, first off wasps do not pollinate plants or produce honey, they
predate on other insects and their nests are not built of honeycomb, but
out of paper created by chewing wood and leaves (although their nests
are structured similarly with hexagonal shapes.)

As for bees, GM crops are typically tested in areas where there are
little or no native bee populations. If you were not aware, most of the
native bees in North America died off a couple years ago due to the
depradations of a *naturally* evolved fungal infection epidemic (showing
that evolution itself still has far more impact upon our environment
than we think we do in our hubris). Most farmers these days have been
dependent upon bee breeders to bring their hives around to provide help
with pollenation. Due to this, we have unique conditions where it is
relatively easy to find areas that are free of bees, and to keep them
free of bees, and where crops pollinate each other via wind conducted
pollen.

The anti-GM forces don't go after established GM crops that are already
in the environment and which have shown no negative impact. They go
after research plots where new strains are being tested in the open.
They know they can't put the genie of established GM crops back in the
bottle, but they can fight a delaying war, impeding and sabotaging
efforts to introduce new varieties of GM crops.

Since established GM crops and animal species have shown absolutely no
negative impact to date, the fears of the luddites are pretty much
unfounded. They take the rather rational concern about keeping
potentially endemic species from getting loose, and blow it way out of
proportion. They have shown absolutely no interest in actually
participating in work to ensure that potentially dangerous crops are
safe for the environment. All they are interested in is sabotage. Their
real goals have only a little to do with their stated goals of
environmental concern, and have much more to do with preventing the US
gengineering industry from enabling the farmers of the world to keep
feeding the people of the world, because they know that well fed people
are far less likely to seek revolution. It is not an accident that these
anti-GM groups are organized around and with the help of established
marxist and maoist groups, in and around communist, socialist, wobbly,
and other radical leftist bookstores and reading rooms around the
country. These are the facts that they don't want to admit to.

Plant pollen is not like grey goo, so stop giving it that level of
alarmism. It is more like a forest fire, which it is possible to fight
and contain and eliminate (much as we have eliminated smallpox and other
diseases).

Napigator.com is supposed to answer this, apparently. 

I wonder about the legality of creating a virus that only targets
napster. If it is merely doing in action what the courts of the land and
the police agencies cannot seem to accomplish (much like Eliezer's old
goal of a virus that eliminates the coca plant), is it vandalism or
merely vigilantism? If it is non-violent, then its not illegal
vigilantism, is it?

~Nanotechnology Industries Newsletter Issue 2 is now available!
This issue features an inside view on what is happening in Zyvex, the first
company founded to develop molecular manufacturing technology. (interview
with George Skidmore). Also read the thoughts of Robert Freitas, author of
Nanomedicine, on what we might be spending after nanotechnology is
developed. Will Ware (author of NanoCAD) provides a perspective on a simple
approach to modeling some nanoscale devices. Charles Ostman (senior fellow,
Institute for Global Futures) explores the convergence of breakthroughs in
biotechnology as a progenitor to transformation of the world by
nanotechnology. I have included a transcript of an interview I gave to
journalist Max Block of
Columbia University. Following the calendar of conferences and events is a
collection of news shorts on significant nanotechnology milestones and
issues since the last publication.

Freenet does do this to some extent.  It is a decentralized network which
can hold data.  Each data item has a name or "key" which controls where
it ends up in the network.  If you know the name of a data item you can
then fetch it, and your fetch request will be routed to the same place
so that it finds the data.

Presently you have to know the exact name of the item, which makes it
less useful for music where you might want to search just by artist,
album, or part of a song name.  The Freenet team is working on providing
a method for searches to work.  It will use a different approach than
gnutella, similar to fuzzy logic.  However it will not be 100% reliable
and will still have the problem that you will not be guaranteed to find
all data items that are in the network.

A simple approach to combine decentralization and reliable searches is
to simply have a large number of servers, each of which replicate the
entire database (or a substantial fraction of it).  An example might be
the PGP key server infrastructure, with a dozen or so key servers each
holding PGP public keys, periodically exchanging data to make sure all
are obsolete.  The DNS root servers use a similar concept.  These are
not fully decentralized, but the basic idea could probably scale up to
having on the order of 100 or even 1000 servers, which would make it
difficult to shut them down one by one.

This is not a particularly powerful statement, though.  All you'd have to do
to prove it true is find ONE human who doesn't have the goal of making
herself happy. This doesn't mean one cannot adopt the assumption for various
purposes such as economic models; it DOES mean that when one draws
conclusions based on the model, one should keep in mind the fact that the
model is based on an unproven assumption.

A prestigious new company called DNA Sciences has created an exciting new
paradigm by using the internet to collect DNA samples.  Featuring James
Watson (co-discoverer of DNA) and Netscape's Jim Clark on the board of
directors, this promises to be a very lucrative new enterprise.  Check out

Dare I even *think* the "G" word in this list again?  Oh well, once again 
ignoring my better judgment here goes...

"The 1994 Brady law, which required handgun sellers to make background

Actually, predicting human action based on the self-interest principle isn't
always easy.  At the individual level, there are psychological quirks which
cause people to act in ways that are detrimental to their well-being by any
reasonable standard, eg. people who spend their spare time cutting their
noses with pieces of broken glass, or people who don't change their
lifestyles and eating habits even as their weight passes the 300 pound mark.
At the macro level, you have various mass hysterias such as Holland's 17th
century tulip mania, or the more recent rise and fall of the emu
market(that's emu as in the bird, not the money) in the US, or nation-state
wars.

Its no secret in the music industry that over 75% of the cost of a CD goes 
into manufacturing, packaging, distribution and record company profit.  Only 
about 1/5 of the price pays for actual production of the recording and 
payment to the artist.  It is *only* that 1/5 that I have any desire to pay.

  IAN: The difficulty is related to determining
  how all people will define their self-interest,
  which by the nature of self-interest is individual.
  But that they will act in a way they believe is
  in their self-interest is, I believe, a given.

Actually, its the Varroa mite that's been killing off the honey bees, and
it's the Italian honey bee that's effected, not native bees. Here in Texas
we have populations of Africanized honey bees that are surviving well in the
wild, and there's research underway to identify resistant strains of Italian
honey bees.

I believe the grain crops you're referring to are the ones which contain
genes from the *Bacillus thuringiensis*, a bacterium which is lethal to the
larvae of moths and butterflies. Based on what I know about the way plants
and other organisms interact, I think the insertion of the Bt gene into
grain crops is a bad idea.

Actually, I'm rather impressed that you could demonstrate such
objectivity as to post this article here. It proves what gun sellers and
gun owners have known: criminals don't buy their guns at gunshops. I do
doubt, though, that the anti-gun forces like HCI will let themselves be
confused by the facts.

Naaah, it's more: why bother to make such a statement at all.

Ah, I was under the impression that the mite transmitted the fungus, but
I may be mistaken.

But is there any evidence to show that its a bad idea? Info I've seen
says its ok, whenever researchers actually get any plants to grow
without them being sabotaged by greens.

Any economic model which assumes that people are acting to maximize their
happiness or well-being. Here's an example of some people using such a
model:

A given?  Wait a minute.  I thought we were talking about proofs.

Reason: my wifes grandfather, her father and her brother all read every
LAmour book, and loved them all, except they all hated Haunted Mesa.
In an effort to be a part of the family, I tried to read a LAmour book,
hated it.  Tried another, put it down, couldn't pick it back up.  Then
I reasoned, if they hated Haunted Mesa, perhaps I would like it.  Well,
it was silly, but far less so than the westerns.  Actually it had its moments,
if one is in the mood for that sorta thing.  spike

The tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi, is a serious and growing problem for
Kentucky beekeepers. The microscopic internal mite clogs the breathing tubes
of adult bees, blocking oxygen flow and eventually killing them. Also called
acarine disease, it affects the flight efficiency and causes a large number
of crawling bees outside the hive that are unable to fly. The inability to
fly can contribute to losses of field bees and reduction of food stores in
the colony. Another symptom is the abnormal "disjointed" position of the
wings of walking bees.

The evidence I've seen indicates that the plants grow and produce seed.
That's about all I can say. I believe yields are slightly lower than yields
of crops without the gene (if such crops are treated with insecticides), but
I can't remember where I saw this. I don't know whether the food value of
the GM grains has been tested, but I do know that small changes in molecules
of foods can cause large changes in the way the food is metabolized.

If you have links to published research about yields, relative amounts of
pesticides required, and metabolism of GM grains, I'd be grateful if you
could share them.

Yeah, but look at the costs he cites:

How many downloads so far?
                                 152,132

                                 How many have paid?
                                 116,200, or 76.38 per cent.
                                 93,200 have paid up front with
                                 credit cards, using
                                 Amazon.com's service. 23,000
                                 have promised to pay later, and
                                 these payments are showing
                                 up already (one guy sent me a
                                 silver dollar). The pay-through
                                 rate has been higher than I
                                 dared hope.

                                 Costs to you, as of Part 1?

                                 A lot fewer downloads than

                                 more sources and in many
                                 cases given away for free. If
                                 THE PLANT gets done, people
                                 are going to be downloading
                                 well into 2001, even with
                                 longer segments on offer. If
                                 those who have downloaded
                                 Part 1 so far download the
                                 following ten or eleven
                                 installments, the total
                                 downloads would be 1,673,452.
                                 Do the math. It's pretty good
                                 math, if people keep coming
                                 back.

As Hal says, if. (But he won't need to pay that much in future advertising
blitzes on this.)

Are you saying that now I have to pay you for this response you just gave me?
How much do you want, I'll get out my credit card number?  What?  This isn't the

millions arguing before the court system for the likes of Capitol Records and
20th Century Fox.  Thanks!

Not so, that's the whole point of the RIAA lawsuit regardless of anything else
they say.  They certainly are not arguing on the behalf of the artists.  If they
were, then why are the only paying these poor bastards less than a dollar per
CD?  Where is all that other money going.  Lets see, I'm thinking for a moment -
I got it - the executives paychecks!!  Lets not forget those multi-million
dollar hyping budgets in order to get N'Sync and Brittany Spears albums to
market.  Give me a friggin break!

> No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being

Exactly!  The internet is progress, so why don't you tell the RIAA to get the
hell out of the way!  If an artist wants to use the internet to promote his
music, and if he wants to create a way to play without it being re-produced -
that's his responsibility.  Relying on governmental intervention to get the job
done is ludicrous.  He made it, he promoted it, I listen to it.  I hear it on
the radio, I hear it on MTV.  I recorded it on MTV.  I play it whenever I want.
Then along comes Napster and I can find the same song and record it on my hard
drive - and now it's a crime?  This is the most convoluted crap I have ever been
dis-privaleged to expose my brain to.

No one has proven that its going to make music worse either.  Nothing can be
worse than the over-marketed hype they call music now-a-days.  Then of course we
have all the extremely talented musicians that I hear at small concerts around
this part of the country.  They have not inked million dollar contracts, and
their music is easily as good as the rich pop stars.  So what's motivating them
- perhaps the pure love of music?  Oh I forgot, its not about the music in the
end - its the money, money, moneyaaa, .....moneyaaaaa!

For now yes, but thats the whole point of my argument.  There is going to come a
point, when nanotechnology really hits hard and all this IP hogwash has to go.
Because nanotechnology will give people the ability to replicate anything the
want.  All intellectual property will do in the end, and increasingly
totalitarian measures will be needed, is create a nano divide that makes the
current digital divide look like a toddlers dispute.

Ah yes, but intellectual property is being used to squash new technologies and
eliminate the real potential of what the internet is.  If the movie studios
cannot figure out how to make a profit in the age of the internet, then maybe
they need to seriously examine everything they do - including the medium of the
movie itself.  Otherwise they need to create ways to distribute their movies
with uncrackable encryption.  But if I crack it I get it.

They DO, however, buy them at places where the Brady checks are not in force, such as gun shows.  The only sensible response to this fact is to expand the checks to cover those areas also.

The cost of a CD consists of several layers:

Demo
Recording
Graphic-artwork
Music video
CD-Production
Advertising campaign
Distribution (transport/stores)
sales tax

A CD-Production costs about $1 including packaging and printing of the
booklet.
So yes you can save that.

You can also save most of the distribution costs. Especially as bandwith
gets cheaper.

But that still leaves:

Demo
Recording
Graphic-artwork
Music video
Advertising campaign
sales tax

The more bands that makes and receives CD's the more need there will be for
marketing. This is happening allready now where it is practically impossible
to break a new band without TV advertising.

So probably free distribution will not make it cheaper to sell music as
there will be a bigger need for marketing. This might be leveled somewhat by
the fact that more people probably will buy music if it is readily available
on-line.

I don't know about you but I would like to see more and better music video's
and I would like even better and more progressive music. Furthermore I will
like to know about music that I like in the Fringe of the techno scene. 

A million artist doing their own website for promoting music will not do
that. I have no time to search all that information. I don't even have time
to do it on mp3.com as they take in everything. All I have ever heard (well
almost all) on mp3.com is demo quality at best. An artist is not the best
judge of his own work. Thus I want a filtering infrastructure that can give
ME the high quality music that I like.

This is what a recording company should do (You can also call them editors,
critics etc. Same difference.). So I don't think they will go away. I don't
want them to go away.

This sounds hauntingly familiar.

From:

July 13, 2000

...
Routers look at every
packet, determine what type of packet it is, where it is coming from and where
it is
going to, then the router delivers the packet to its intended destination. This
is what
routers do. Adding the Carnivore task is a simple matter of blind copying every
packet
to or from a bad guy to a third address at the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in
Washington, DC. It's at most a few lines of code and requires no additional
hardware. 

 So why the box? 

The probable reason is because cops like to be in control. They LIKE boxes, like
delivering them in unmarked cars, like the satisfying click of the RJ-45
connector as it
 slides home.
...

 ....But I have my own theory about Carnivore. From a network 
architecture standpoint, the best location for Carnivore is right 
after the ISP's router. This puts Carnivore in the path of every 
packet entering or leaving the ISP. It's also a major reason why 
ISPs might not want to install Carnivore boxes -- it's the network's 
point of greatest vulnerability. In this position, Carnivore can 
act as a listening and recording device, OR IT CAN ACT AS A SWITCH. 
If we ever hear a proposal from the FBI in which it plans to install 
Carnivores at all 6000 ISPs in the U.S., we'll be giving the government 
the power to do something it can't do right now. 

Shut the Internet down. 

======

Again, I think the purpose is to filter content in wartime or other 
national emergency, real or concocted. A standardized box that a
military training school tech can service fits this theory.

Truth is the first casualty in war.

In the music industry like any other kind of business 90% of everything is a

in the stores never makes back the production costs.

Not if we let it destroy the economical system.

If it is possible and legal to just copy something for free we will never
know it's actual worth. How much would people be willing to pay for it. And
also how much is it worth for society. Forget about the free market. There
will be no market... only free.

Oh but you are not able to listen to it on a walkman. You have to use a
videotape to play it back which is a hassle. And there are several other
reasons why you would want you music on a CD. Those reasons sort of
dissapear on MP3. It is a better medium in many regards than any other there
has been for music. Excluding sound quality. In short in the other mediums
there are barriers to entry that most people don't record their music that
way. At least not in a big way.

Linux is very nice but it is a tool somebody has made so they don't have to
pay for the tools from other. Free hammers would also be nice for the
carpentry business but would destroy the hammer business. So you can turn it
around and say that if people want free music they should make it themself.
Just like the Linux crowd supposedly does.

Here is the difference, about the software/hammer analogy.  Making two copies of
a software is a marginal action.  Making two copies of a hammer requires twice
the quantities the comprise the hammer.  Also, making a hammer requires forging,
casting, or machining the hammer head and possibly the handle, or carving the
handle.

So, both software and hammer have start-up costs, the software's fixed costs
being the programming time and code and test platforms which are mostly reused
or reusable, while the hammer has the fixed costs of the machines and tools to
make the hammer.

After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless operation.

I see those as obvious statements.

Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands upon
thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely given.

There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed to the
sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it running
half the Internet.

Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.  Some
patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of sum
societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.

Yes but the fixed price in music is very high for an individual without hope
of  making money back.

They were freely shared. That is different. You share and you get something
back because of the GNU license. Thus everybody gets a better tool to work
with.

Music is (usually) neither freely given nor shared. A musician who's music
is copied does not get anything back from the comunity. He might himself get
free music, but that doesn't buy him bread. It's sort of a reverse "Tragedy
of the commons". He looses and socity wins. In the short term at least, as
he would quickly stop producing music.

Linux has been paid for one way or another. The price might be hidden but it
has been paid and it has been thriving on the swing/carrousel principle.

There has been and always will be garage bands, as long as there are garages.
There is an untold number of semi-professional musicians scattered throughout
the world.

The industry itself produces in a very blatant manner those acts which it
promotes the most, and which provide it the most money.  I'm not saying that
there are contrived bands, but there are contrived bands.

In different people's opinions, there are better and worse bands and musicians.

The fixed price of distributing records in music stores is very high, perhaps
uncompetitively so.

By the same token, there are thousands and thousands of labels.

Some actually do share their music freely.

For some, if their music is copied, or in others words it influences others,
then that is sometimes a benefit to the originator, in some cases.

Yes we do.

In regards to sum societal utility, I suggest the Samuelson Utility Function, my
favorite economic function.  Thusly, almost everything may be subjected to
cost-benefit analysis, which includes the air that we breathe.

Have a nice day,

Really Joe? I did not, in fact, see ANYTHING AT ALL in that article that
said any such thing. I suppose I could rely on you to keep the torch of
fabricating the 'facts' going in full force. In fact, since gun show gun
purchases are considered legal gun purchases AND studies show that less
than 3% of gun crimes (outside of suicides, if you call those crimes)
are actually committed with legally purchased guns, then I would have to
conclude that you are once again lying through your teeth. Please come
back when you actually have something truthful to contribute...

One of the telling statements in the tv story was that the cheif
'scientist' claiming the danger to people says that if erythrymicin were
in the milk, and people ate the milk, it would make their bodies more
resistant to erythrymicin. However, its not the human body's resistance
that is important, but the resistance of any diseases humans may
contract, a significantly different thing.

I also found it rather telling that the reporters objections to Fox
general counsel desiring balance in the story, which its apparent the
reporters were not interested in, demonstrates the total lack of
objectivity by the reporters, and thus the story is suspect.
Additionally, its apparent that from the websites they link to, that
this is some sort of campaign by anti-milk people promoting a lactose
free diet, and while there is, on a related site, a few references to
studies, none are linked to anything on the web, nor do the reporters
provide ANY links to any studies done of IGF-1 impact on human health,
which they claim is a 'growing body of evidence'. Great, lets see the
evidence.

In Illinois you have to have a license to purchase a gun, yes, even
at gun shows. It is illegal for anyone to sell a gun to anyone not
posessing a valid FOID card. Now where are the hoods in Chicago
getting them?

So we have fact #1) if the entire corn crop was 100% of this
variety then the monarch would become extinct.

Now the question is at what level does the monarch population
crash? 50%? Then if half of the crop was of this variety we could
expect extinction. Actually the number I suspect is much lower, but
the fact is we don't really know.

Now another fact, Monarch's are a migrating species, they fly from
all over North America to a single mountain top in Mexico if I
recall correctly.

Now what do you think could happen if you planted a large enough
field of this GM corn at a strategic point along this migration
route?

Take printed material, like a book. I can cut off the binder and feed it
into a Docutech scanner and reproduce as many as I want for only a
couple bucks each. Should I be able to do that? How about once I've
scanned it in (which only takes a couple minutes of time) I send it to
my workstation and have the scanned pages OCR'ed. I can now send that
book anywhere. Have I broken any laws? Its easy to reproduce that book
now for nothing, and I don't need to mess with printing costs, etc.

Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
$40-80, which is little different from other operating systems. Can I
reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? No, I
can't.

Given Moore's Law, most any patent on computer related items issued at
the time of its technological and economical applicability has only an
18 month window of marketablity.

Several years ago I had an experience with 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic
Acid--same chemical family as 2,4,5-T or "Agent Orange") which is a
broad-leaf herbicide extensively used on pasture land in my region. It's
related to the plants' natural growth hormone and kills the plant by causing
unregulated growth.

My neighbor needed to have his barn cleaned out, and I needed nutrients for
my garden, so I got some good exercise shoveling manure. My neighbor didn't
spray his pasture, so I felt certain the manure would be safe to use. After
the addition of the manure, the garden soil was beautiful to behold.
However, within a few days of transplanting into the garden, the plants in
the nightshade family (including Irish potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and
eggplants) began to grow in that frightening, contorted manner which
indicates 2,4-D poisoning--the nightshade or solanacea family is especially
susceptible to 2,4-D, so these were the first to exhibit symptoms.

I immediately took some cuttings from the sick plants to my agricultural
extension agent, who told me that he saw this sort of thing all too
frequently.  The 2,4-D is concentrated in the animals' urine, so the dose
conferred by the manure can be even higher than the original dose applied to
the pasture. It turned out that my neighbor had bought some hay from a
pasture that had been sprayed, and this was the source of the 2,4-D in his
animals' manure. Sunlight breaks down the chemical within a few months, but
in the absence of sunlight, it can persist for YEARS.

The chemical is so powerful that a few molecules escaping from a tank on a
passing truck can damage cotton crops. My ag extension agent, educated at a
university which praised chemicals such as 2,4-D has come to see them as
dangerous.

I haven't seen any research addressing concentration of 2,4-D, bovine growth
hormone, or other chemicals in cows' milk, but I've seen research done on
the breast milk of Inuit women living in remote sub-Arctic regions which
have revealed surprisingly high concentrations of toxic chemicals
(transferred from the developed world via wind & water) in their milk. I
suspect that most commercial cows' milk contains fairly high doses of
various synthetic hormones.

Seeing's how I want to live a long and healthy life, I avoid the
contaminated milk problem by milking my own goats or purchasing cows' milk
from a dairy which claims not to use BGH (I've personally inspected the
dairy to satisfy myself as to the truth of their claim). It doesn't make
sense to me to take other life extension measures without paying close
attention to the food I eat.

Zero, you win the Extropian award for open minded thinking and
reporting today.

Keep up the good work, we'll have you as a member (NRA) yet.

Here's a thought: "Why is it that in Chicago handgun crime is
fairly common despite the fact that they banned handguns over 18
years ago, yet the surrounding suburbs where handguns are legal
have almost no handgun crime?"

My reaction to the web site in question was similar to yours, Mike. But
wide-spread use of antibiotics in animals feeds would theoretically lead to
resistant strains of bacteria, and apparently it HAS contributed to the fact
that many bacteria are now resistant to all but one or two antibiotics and
that there's a constant race between lab and bacteria; and the bacteria seem
to be pulling ahead. Cetainly resistant bacteria can be introduced into a
consumer's body as when, for example, the person is preparing raw meat for
cooking.

I'm more familiar with the chicken industry than the milk industry. I've
seen some appalling things on chicken farms--VERY sick, cancerous chickens
that I wouldn't even want to TOUCH, much less eat. I raise my own chickens,
and the meat and eggs I produce bear little resemblance to the stuff I see
for sale in the supermarket.  I'd have to be starving before I'd eat
commercial chicken meat; and from what I've heard & read, the beef & milk
industries in general are no better.

I would not pay for a MP3 track (not even 10 cents). The quality just isn't
good enough for me to spend money on. Besides I predict the whole format
will die out within a max of 4 years as increasingly cheap bandwidth and
storage allow pirates to trade perfect digital copies of CD tracks instead of
lossily compressed ones.

In two years or less you are going to be able to buy a 360GB hard drive for
under $500 that will hold 400+ CDs in perfect quality. You will have the
bandwidth on your home (and perhaps wireless) networks to stream those
CDs to anywhere you want. CD players will eventually die out.

P.S. Creative launches 6GB portable MP3 player:

You made the initial comparison with H-bombs ...... I only point out that

Yes, but even forest fires are harmful .... and aren't some diseases (TB?)
that were once thought to have been eliminated fighting back?

There are no remote mountains or whatever in the UK that can be freed of
bees, even if there might be in the States. But surely other insects move
pollen about as well as bees?

OK, so you question the motives of "greenies" who may have left-wing
politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big agri-businesses
pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
self-interest and financial gain.  Aren't some of the GM crops being
selectively modified  to uptake more of a particular brand of pesticide?

If they want to feed the starving millions in Asia, then maybe they could
donate the $m's they are throwing at GM foods research. Why isn't the same
level of research going into permaculture?

No, since monarchs are not dependent upon corn for their diet, there are many
other crops being planted besides corn, as well as wild growth in uncultivated
areas.

Yes, and I suspect that areas that are overwhelmingly covered with this GM corn
would simply be flown around by the monarchs, much as migratory waterfowl change
their migratory routes to fit the availability of wetlands.

I'm not sure. However, I have found from my own experience that the Monarch
Butterfly's primary diet is NOT pollen or leaves from plants like corn, but they
feed on animal dung. You heard it, thats right, animal dung. During the monarch
migration through our area, I never see monarchs in cornfields. I do however see
them congregating en masse on piles of cow, deer, and moose dung. This key fact
in my mind tends to blow out of the water the claims of the anti-GM bunch about
a threat to the Monarch Butterfly. What the GM corn IS a threat to is the Boll
Weevil, which DOES feed on corn, as well as cotton. However the fact that the
anti-GM bunch chooses to emphasise a marginal if not false threat to the Monarch
Butterfly, which most people like and think are beautiful creatures, and ignore
or deemphasise the threat to the Boll Weevil, which most people will admit is a
pest that is better off on the endangered species list, fits in perfectly with
my theory of the 'Cute and Fuzzy' modus operandi of the Greens, which only
incriminates their personal as well as scientific integrity (assuming there was
any to begin with).

Brian,
    Thank you.  As a guy living in one of those suburbs I will use that 
ammunition.  Did you ever notice the guys that go on a shooting rampage and 
killing innocents?  I am sure you have; but did you ever notice how few of 
them ever receive return fire even by policemen?
    I keep hearing that some of these shooting rampages have been ended by 
citizens defending themselves but that these incidents do not make the media. 
 Do you have any facts on this?

No, I compared YOUR fears and level of alarmism to similar levels of alarmism
about nuclear power and nuclear war. I did NOT compare GM to H-bombs. Please
re-read what I posted.

They fight back where people don't actually give them a good fight. Resistant TB
strains evolved specifically because people with TB, in their characteristic
lack of attention to detail, stopped taking the antibiotics when they started
feeling better, rather than completing the entire regimen of antibiotics as
instructed by their doctors.

None do to the same extent, though butterflies are pretty good, and hummingbirds
are also, but these do not deal with corn. Corn's overwhelmingly primary method
of pollination is by wind.

If they can uptake it, it would be because the plant metabolizes the pesticide,
rendering it harmless to humans in the fruit.

What is permaculture?

My little sister worked part time for a local dairy farmer (she found dealing
with cows very relaxing after a long day dealing with hospital morons' self
generated problems with their computers) and is of the opinion, and the guy she
worked for is also of the opinion based on his own research, that BGH is not a
threat, that its all just scare tactics by 'organic' farmers trying to boost the
market for their higher priced products.

But if we are always ingesting small amounts of the antibiotic, would that 
make the bacterias and germs more resistant eventually?

Perhaps I could phrase it better, so "stop learning" is more obviously
"stop learning about the world", but the latter phrase seems rather
clunky in that context (since I just said "how the world works", and I'd
rather avoid repeating "the world" in such a short span).  Can you think
of a better way to phrase it?

Err...why does it have to be "in college", if we're going for non-degree
education?  Some of the most useful education I've gotten has been
completely outside of formal educational institutions.

BTW, since you're not commenting on the rest of the essay, does that mean
you do not see ways that it could be improved?

Here's some facts: a large percent of illegally purchased guns used in gun
crimes in CHicago were sold to criminals BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. As Brian can
probably give more details on this, there has been an ongoing scandal involving
members of the Chicago police department and members of the ATF selling large
quantities of guns to criminals, ostensibly as part of 'undercover operations'
which never wound up with any arrests. A similar situation is being uncovered
right now in Boston in the Cape Verdean community, which has seen an increase in
gun violence due apparently to the illegal gun running activities of one Cape
Verdean gentleman, Augusto Lopez, who, it turns out, bought his guns from
'undercover policemen'.  This just resulted on Sunday in the first youth killed
by gunfire in Boston since 1998, a Cape Verdean 16 year old boy shot during a
drive by in Dorchester. This Lopez character was just arrested last week, and
we'll have to see what turn up in the story if any of his guns purchased from
cops are in fact murder weapons. While normally, such an offense would result at
least in gun trafficing charges against the sellers, but I doubt any policmen,
in Boston or CHicago, will ever be convicted of such.

I'm not sure whether small amounts contribute to that at all. It is my
impression that resistance is only evolved when strains have been subject to
high levels of the antibiotic, enough to kill some or most of the bacteria.
Repeated exposures of such high mortality rates would evolve resistant strains.

A book is a media delivery format, just like a disk.  Its content is covered by fair
use and other copyright laws.  If it's your personal copy of your book you can do with
it as you please as long as you take reasonable measures in good faith to preserve the
fair use and copyrights, barring alternative agreement..

Now, if you have one scanner and printer, each hardware, if you want another of each
then that requires duplicate physical resources and manufacturing capability.

I disagree.  When we were examining the copyright statutes before, I noticed that
there are specific concerns of the semiconductor industry addressed therein.
Considering any part of the von Neumann architecture (memory, bus, processor) I think
that no part of it is patented, yet specific chip designs and manufacturing methods
almost certainly have patents, and many are used throughout multiple generations of
processor and other hardware design architecture, which is largely quite beyond me
besides the use of layman terms and acquaintance of some EEE engineers.

Here's a typical example of a "bad" patent: Lempel-Ziv-Welch dictionary stream
compression.  The patent on this method of compression, acquired ten or so years ago
by Unisys, was not enforced (coincidentally, unenforcement of copyright claims leads
them to be unenforceable) for several years as it became a commodity compression
method, and then it was, somehow, and became a barrier to entry to the use of that
simple algorithm.

As far as I know, if a copyright claim is not made within a reasonable time from when
such claims would be valid, then they become invalid.  I can not say if that holds
true for patents, an arcane sector in need of retrofit.

Monarch larvae eat only members of the Milkweed family, adults only
drink nectar.

According to the Monarch sanctuary website, they enter a biological
state during migration to conserve fuel, (2000 miles) so between
that and the limitations of their instincts I think large scale
avoidance unlikely.

Don't let the facts get in the way though.....

What sort of research did the guy your sister worked for do? I haven't seen
any research on BGH, but I've looked at the research on 2,4-D, which is a
synthetic plant growth hormone.  Some of the research concludes that it
causes cancer in mammals; other research says it doesn't, and it's not
always obvious from the published papers why there should be such
discrepancies. Possibly there's some factor that wasn't controlled for, such
as the presence or absence of other synthetic hormones in the animals'
diets, possibly some of the data was faked--who knows?

My basic strategy is to err on the side of caution when it comes to eating
potentially powerful chemicals, whether they be naturally occurring or
synthetic.   I don't, for example, eat datura seeds or mescal beans or the
glandular secretions of frogs. Clearly, 2,4-D and BGH are not as toxic as
those things.  I may be silly to avoid them, and in fact I don't always
avoid them. I DO sometimes eat in restaurants or at the homes of people who
aren't as picky about their food as I am. But I don't think I'll feel
comfortable eating these hormones regularly until I'm able to figure out why
there are such differences in the research results.

The antibiotics break down when food is heated in cooking, so people
probably wouldn't be eating them.  But people are exposed to resistant
bacteria when they prepare the meat for cooking.

My undergrad physiology teacher claimed (but gave no refs) that the 
manufacturing process for 2,4-D produced trace levels of dioxin.  If
so (since dioxin is a strong carcinogen) you would get varying results
depending on the manufacturing process and the degree to which 
dioxin was purified out.

I would like to send e-mail containing some set theory symbols. Character

I'd be most grateful for advice.

Not at all; in the wild monarch caterpillars will eat nothing but milkweed.
They don't eat corn at all, of any type.  In any case, insects have so
far proved resistant to elimination by poisoning; we've yet to exterminate
one species with pesticides.  And, god knows, we've tried.

If every plant in the world were a cultivated one, monarchs (and many,
many, other things) would go extinct.  This is why improving the efficiency
of our crop production is so important.  Better corn yields result in more
of the Great Plains being returned to the "natural" state.

I don't think it can be proved one way or the other, Ian, until people know
more about how the mind works. There are numerous examples of people acting
in ways that are against their own self interest, and there's no way to say
for sure whether they mistakenly believe that what they're doing IS in their
best interest, or whether they are not motivated by self interest after all.

 In living my life I operate under the assumption that people are motivated
by self interest, and when someone tells me they're not I tend to watch my
back when I'm around them.  I'm fond of Ludwig von Mises' book _Human
Action_ , and I like his argument against the existence of altruism. I just
don't think you can say it's been proved that all people are always
motivated by self interest.

Well... to be truthful, not very much.  But you're welcome to send me a

Your slippery slope argument is is... uh... dumb.

"Oh, what, you want to protect your ideas?!  Oh, I suppose you're going to
want to charge for every word you speak!  I suppose you're going to want to
charge people for seeing what you look like it public!  I suppose you're
going to want to track down every time your name is uttered and send someone
a bill!"

Isn't there a nice reasonable attractor state somewhere between "absolute
dictatorial control over IP" and "absolute elimination of IP?"

Now I'm as much in favor of the Internet as anyone, but I also don't blindly
equate its evolution with 'progress.'  IMO, that's part of the problem
here-- some automatically assume that the Internet can do no wrong and just
want to make its progress as unimpeded as possible.  I, on the other hand,
think it might be charming if we little humans had some say in where things
went next.

Let me try to simplify it for you then:

Scenario A: He make music.  Radio promote music.  He sell music.  Radio sell
advertising.
Result A: They provide a service and get paid for it.

Scenario B: He make music.  You take music.
Result B: They provide a service and not get paid for it.


So what's motivating them

I think it's very nice that you want to rely on an individual's pure love of
their art form to ensure high quality product.

Personally, when it comes to things like pharmaceuticals, automobile design,
software development, etc, I don't mind if we throw in a handful of extra
creators who happen to be profit motivated.  Hey, the people who do it for
pure love can stay!

Many communists use the argument that capitalism approaches fascism.  Again,
these slippery slope arguments are reactionary.  I agree that vast economic
gulfs already exist.  Does it follow that the solution is to eliminate
ownership?  I suspect it probably is... I imagine that ye olde communist
Russia had smaller economic gulfs than ye olde U.S. of A.

It appears to me that people who rail against the divide seem remarkably
blind to a lot of the benefits unequal distribution of weath confers.

You say squash, I say foster.  You say these rules are crippling our growth,
I say that they are responsible for it.  (Uh, we -are- growing, right?)

Not too surprising overall, some pro, a lot of worries.  Pretty reasonable
for a first exposure to the ideas.

One thing that did surprise me was the many comparisons to Star Trek's
Borg.  While nano would presumably make the Borg more possible, their
technology doesn't seem to be particularly tied to nanotech, any more
than any other futuristic tech.  (I know the Voyager show did claim that
assimilation involved injecting nanobots, but only dedicated fans would
be aware of that, as it was mentioned in only a couple of episodes of
that relatively low-rated Star Trek series.)

Concerns about out-of-control nano or engineered viruses seem much more
plausible as a first reaction.  "Thinking small" just doesn't seem to lead
to an image of the Borg.  Perhaps it is just a metaphor for unstoppable
future changes.

But why, then, does not a similar problem arise in plain idea futures (not
linked to decisions)? There, too, early speculators know that later
speculators will have more information, but that doesn't introduce any
biases. The fact that the final odds are linked to a decision seems
immaterial, since what the decision will be is determined by the later odds,
and the only way to guess the decision is to guess the later odds. If there
is some technical point here that I'm overlooking, could you please give a
reference?

> What is permaculture?

Here's the best site I know of for info on permaculture:

http://www.permaculture.org.au/index.shtml

This site includes info and photos of Tagari Farm, a project started by Bill
Mollison; IMO it's worth checking out the site just to see the photos of the
farm.

I first heard of permaculture when I was describing my garden to someone I
met at a party: the wild volunteers growing alongside cultivated crops; the
greywater system; the fish pond; the chickens and goats in their
vine-covered pens. (I lived in town at the time, and the neighborhood kids
called my place the City Farm [with the accent on "city"} The person I was
talking to said, "Oh, you have a permaculture garden."  "What's
permaculture?" I asked, and that's how I learned of Bill Mollison.

I've never had the privilege of taking one of Bill's courses, but I keep his
books close at hand for inspiration and practical information. Many of the
things in the books I'd come up with independently, which is not surprising,
since the methods logically follow from a close observation of the way
things work.

>From _Permaculture_:

pg. ix  "Permacultue is the conscious design an maintenance of
agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability,
and resilience of natural ecosystems.  It is the harmonious integration of
landscape and people providing their food, energy, shelter, and other
material and non-material needs in a sustainable way...The philosophy behind
permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of
protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless
acti on; of looking at systems in all their functions, rather than asking
only one yield of them; and of allowing systems to demonstrate their own
evolutions."

pg 1  "The courage we need is to refuse authority and to accept only
personally responsible decisions...It is...our only possible decision to
withhold all support for destructive systems, and to cease to invest our
lives in our own annihilation."

pg. 10  "It is alarming that in western society no popular body of
directives has arisen to replace the injunctions of tribal taboo and myth.
When we left tribal life we left with it all guides to sensible behaviour in
the natural world...by never having the time or commonsense to evolve new or
current guiding directives, we have forgotten how to evolve self-regulating
systems...[Permaculture] emphasises self-reliance, responsibility, and the
functions of living things.  Within a self-regulated system on earth, energy
from the sun can be trapped and stored in any number of ways.  While the sun
burns, we are in an open system..."

Bonnie,

How true! You're in the predicament that faces LE people. BGH is the least
of your worries... antibiotics; steroids & steroidal analogues &
insecticide/herbicide residues are the real problem - the residues of
weedicides are really a problem.

Farmers often bend /violate the law - with their margins, who'd blame them?
I know of several smallholders who (in my opinion ) are routinely
subclinically poisoned every time they treat a field.

And i know of a small amount who had to be hospitalized because of reckless
application of chemicals. Their actual knowledge of the mode of action and
toxicology of the chemicals was zero.

Additionally, farmers live so close to the forces of nature that they have
an almost fatalistic view of everything... which they end up imposing on us
via the food they supply us.

Short of testing everything you eat; you could have an idea of what might be
in purchased foods grown in your district if you scrutinise the growers of
food.

I became a vegan because I wanted to both lower my cholesterol &  feed lower
down the food chain... later on I became an animal liberationist so it tied
in.

But if you grow your own and purchase neighbourhood grown foodstuff - at
least you have some control and information on what you're eating.

Certainly it would be easier to find out about local pesticide levels from
agricultural extension officers and plain hearsay... than buying stuff from
a supermarket that's plugged into a nationwide distribution network and
trying to guess it out.

Yes, as I pointed out already adult Monarchs only consume nectar,
so it is the adults who are affected by this GM corn. I wasn't
aware corn was a good source for nectar, but apparently it is.
Maybe Bonnie our resident green thumb can enlighten us.

Actually we don't know this for a fact, that's part of the problem.
We do know things like not having vast herds of buffalo turned the

But in fact, since as of the present gun show purchases are NOT under the rubric of the Brady Law, they would not be available to enter in to any statistics.  The fact that there are facts that were not mentioned in a particular article does not negate their facticity; otherwise there would be only the need for one article which would contain all past, present and future truth.  You very well know that some of the weapons used in the Colorado school shooting were purchased at a gun show.  Do you have something against having such purchases checked to keep the purchased guns out of irresponsible, unbalanced, criminal and/or otherwise malevolent hands?  Of COURSE you do, because the NRA does, and you are in mantal thrall to their closes-minded and absolutistic dogmatic doctinal line, which you zealously and fervently memetically propagate every chance you get (and some you don't).  In fact, you're a fanatic about it, and perfectly fit into Sir Winston Churchill's definition of o!
ne: someone who will not change your mind and cannot change the subject.  I'll bet you had a joy spasm when Zero posted that story, because it gave you an opening to indulge in a hundred gun nut posts; I'm quite sure that you'll run with that ball through the goal posts, out of the stadium and into the street.

Buffalo were good for the pronghorn antelope too.  Fortunately,
free-range cattle make an excellent substitute.  Unfortunately, the BLM
hasn't figured this out yet and is restricting free-range cattle from many
areas where pronghorn have been grazing in an effort to "save the
antelope".

Several people have recommended that the Singularity Institute avoid
having any employees if at all possible.  The two alternate
relationships are "contractor" and "fellowship".  The "fellowship"
description fits what I'll be doing, at least until SingInst is ready to
start a coding project with multiple programmers (which won't be for a
while yet), so that's the current plan.

Does anyone here know the exact details of what paperwork is legally
required to create a fellowship?  For example, do I need to file a W-4
with SingInst so that SingInst can withhold tax from fellowship
payments?  Do I need to calculate and send taxes myself on a quarterly
basis?  Or do I just calculate and pay my taxes at the end of the year? 
If I'm not going to be an employee, are things like health insurance
deductible from my taxable income?  And so on.

If there are any Research Fellows on this list, or anyone who's done the
paperwork for fellowships at some point in their lives, please contact
me.

Ah, yes, but a percentage of ***what***?  There's the rub.  Are we talking
about 76% of $50,000, or 3% of $50,000,000?  Nobody knows, so the game gets
interesting.  ***How many*** have downloaded?   How many more are there,
yet to download?  How big is Stevie's payday?  What is his overhead?  Will
Stevie want to turn off the tap, just because only 74% are paying?  73%?
37%?  3%?  

I've heard that at one time there was a vast inland sea on the north
american continent, held in place at its weakest point by a geological
structure--a kind of natural dam, which eventually gave way, causing a
flood of truly apocolyptic proportions, across the (now desert) southwest.
Is this an apt metaphor of the events we are witnessing?  Give the dam
another thump, big guy!  Rock the world, Stevie!  

I wish I had the motivation to write more on this topic, because I'm
thoroughly enjoying the slow-motion drama of the irreversible, unstoppable,
technological liberation of intellectual property.  And I've been thinking
about it more or less nonstop.

For example, once Napster had demonstrated that unprecedented millions of
participants would flock to their cybernode (cheesy carl sagan voice:
"Billions and billions of eyeballs!"), which flocking is the key to making
buckets of money in the new cyber gold rush, it was beyond certainty that
others would follow.  Then, note the nature of competition, where each
participant goes to school by observing the methods and results of those
who've gone before.  While Napster enjoys the benefits of being first to
the mothernode, it also pays to learn the dance of adjustment, and pays its
way through the obstacle course of legal challenge, as the competition
watches.  They want Napster's customers, those millions of earballs,
without Napster's vulnerability.  They go to sleep at night and dream of
defendant Napster, humbled before the black-robed inquistor, weeping at the
words, "...hanged by the neck until dead."  Gnutella, freeNet, scour,
wrapster, more to come, an unending hoarde, the new VC army seeking the
perfect combination of ease of access, technical/legal teflonability, and
commercial exploitability.  The barbarians await beyond the walls of Rome.
It makes me giddy.  Go barbarians!

Really! Can you provide a citing for this? Thought not.....

Actually you got your wish, I've seen Chi-com AK47's, the full auto

But that's not where they get the vast majority, try again.....

Most people don't have ISO-8859-3 fonts on their machines, but at least they
get a message that some characters could not be displayed properly.
OTOH, one can get all the fonts on the Internet.

I currently support ISO-8859-1, US-ASCII, ISO-646-SE, ISO-8859-2,
		    ISO-8859-7, and ISO 2022-JP.

<WARNING LEVEL=VERBOSE>
If you intend to send your e-mail over Internet your e-mail _must_ follow
the Internet rules for e-mail messages.

Terminology
	You use a user agent (UA). It will probably add headers and give the
	e-mail to its local Message Transfer Agent (MTA), which makes sure
	the e-mail follows the Internet rules (hopefully) and sends it the
	next MTA, ... and so on, until the receiver's MTA delivers to the
	recipient, which will read it with some UA.

The Internet rules state:
    If both MTA's agree to support the same 8-bit character set, and the
    channel between them support 8-bit wide connection, they can do so.

    If not, then the e-mail must either
    (a)	    be in 7-bit US-ASCII only, or
    (b)	    be converted using MIME.
   
Q: What happens of you don't follow the rules?
A: It depends.  I know of all these reaction from MTAs:
   (i)		The 8-bit characters came through, and the recipient could
		read it. Success story.

   (ii)		The 8-bit characters came through, but the recipient
		could not read all of it, since some character were
		coded with other bit strings.  This happens e.g. when
		some Macintosh users send e-mail to this list.
		Minor lossage, but no big deal.

   (iii)	The 8-bit characters came through, but the recipient
		could not read any of it, since the sender's character
		set differed totally from the recipient's,  Total lossage.

   (iv)		Some MTA somewhere on the line zeroed the leftmost bit of
		all characters to 7-bits, so some characters became garbled.
		Minor or major lossage, depending on context.

   (v)		Some MTA decided to follow the rules and bounce the message
		since it didn't follow the rules. This happened to some guy
		who send several kilobytes of text in plain English, but
		who happened to have his Swedish adress in the signature
		and it contained one (1) single 8-bit character ("ä").

   (vi)		Some MTA will convert the stuff into MIME, and your e-mail
		will end up containing stuff like this:
		     "r=E4sm=F6rg=E5s"

   (vii)	Some UAs and/or MTAs will convert it to HTML (ugh!).

What about a trust > trustee relationship ?



Several people have recommended that the Singularity Institute avoid
having any employees if at all possible.  The two alternate
relationships are "contractor" and "fellowship".  The "fellowship"
description fits what I'll be doing, at least until SingInst is ready to
start a coding project with multiple programmers (which won't be for a
while yet), so that's the current plan.

Does anyone here know the exact details of what paperwork is legally
required to create a fellowship?  For example, do I need to file a W-4
with SingInst so that SingInst can withhold tax from fellowship
payments?  Do I need to calculate and send taxes myself on a quarterly
basis?  Or do I just calculate and pay my taxes at the end of the year?
If I'm not going to be an employee, are things like health insurance
deductible from my taxable income?  And so on.

If there are any Research Fellows on this list, or anyone who's done the
paperwork for fellowships at some point in their lives, please contact
me.

Actually it appears that MojoNation (www.mojonation.net) does have some
plans for this kind of thing.  They have a module called the "PayLars
Tracker".  (Named after www.paylars.com, a site which allows fans to
send voluntary payments to Metallica and other music groups.)

The PayLars tracker is a database server which links authors to their
works, so that you can find out who the author is for any given work.
Presumably this could be used in the future by an agent which allowed
you to click and send some Mojo to the author.

With my fellowship, I have to pay my own taxes.  Neither my school nor
the funder files tax forms for me.  I've been told the IRS doesn't
enforce this too well, since they don't get any forms; but I paid anyway
since I have moderately complex taxes and suspect I may get audited
someday.  

Quarterly vs. annually depends on how much you owe.  Macintax says I 
needn't file estimates with my current situation but that's probably
influenced by some part-time work I've done for the University. The
Feds grossly overwithold for work done only part of the year.
Computer tax programs can estimate your need for estimated payments,
based on your projected income.

Medical expenses are only deductable if they exceed some portion of 
your income - 7%, I think.  In general, tax-favored benefits can only
come from companies.  You can, however, write off a lot of work-related
expenses.

   IAN: I think it's not accurate to imply
   I said "it's been proved that all people
   are always motivated by self interest."

   Saying I believe the selfish principle is
   a rule and soliciting examples that might
   contradict it is not to declare proof. As
   you note, it probably cannot be proved in
   the conventional sense of scientific proof.
   However, an absence of examples of selfless
   acts/goals would favor the selfish principle
   in the context of finding the most-likely truth.

Have you ever heard of a search engine?  Google finds www.greywater.com as

"blackwater"--water from flush toiletsd.

Ah yet another thing I'd do if I had the time, or would put on my
ProjectsWeb implementation if I had time to finish it. Maybe somebody
out there can make use of this information before I get around to it:

http://www.proaxis.com/~cop/

This site tells you what votes have happened that day and tons of
other current and historical data about those polluters of our 
fragile economy known as the US Congress. For $35 a year, you get
full access to the website, and for $75 a year they add automated

I suggest you read the book _Science Under Siege_. Its very good at
illustrating how environmentalists and 'consumer advocates' use
fraudulent science, or misuse actual scientific data to support their
unsupportable positions. Essentially, EVERYTHING causes cancer, if you
feed rats enough of just that substance. Bran can be made to cause rats
cancer, vitamins, life extension drugs, EVERYTHING. What you need to
look at is the discrepancy between what is called the LD50 point (where
50% of test animals died), and what the normal dose is. If the normal
dose is 10 milligrams per day, and the LD50 dose is 2 kilograms per day,
thats a significant difference, and does not provide any rational
scientific data on its actual carcinogenic risk. The greens think that
if any animals at all die in the test, no matter how much they were
force fed or injected with, then its a 'carcinogenic substance'.

What is the LD50 dose for 2,4-D, and what is the typical level found in
a normal serving of your garden vegetables when they have been raised
fertilized with this chemical???

Are there butterflies that look exactly like Monaroch butterflies, and
which migrate at the same time of the year as monarch butterflies???

greywater is any water produced by the home except that produced by the

So let me get this straight: the resistant bacteria are present in the
MEAT? If that is the case, then the reason there are resistant strains
of bacteria is because the cows are not given ENOUGH anti-biotics to
wipe out the bacteria, so the claims of the greens are not only bogus,
they are completely the opposite of what the proper solution is.

supply and demand.  I. for one, would prefer criminals, the unbalanced
and the irresponsible to have to buy their illegal guns from outside of
the country, not just out of state (in some states); anything that makes
it harder for such people to get their hands on a tool for committing
easy and rapid long range mass murder has to be a GOOD THING.

Guess what Joe: Gun registration, and Brady checks at gun shows won't
end ANY of the illegal trafficking that occurs, so why do keep beating
that dead horse???

> But in fact, since as of the present gun show purchases are NOT under the rubric of the Brady Law, they would not be available to enter in to any statistics.  The fact that there are facts that were not mentioned in a particular article does not negate their facticity; otherwise there would be only the need for one article which would contain all past, present and future truth.  You very well know that some of the weapons used in the Colorado school shooting were purchased at a gun show.  Do you have something against having such purchases checked to keep the purchased guns out of irresponsible, unbalanced, criminal and/or otherwise malevolent hands?  Of COURSE you do, because the NRA does, and you are in mantal thrall to their closes-minded and absolutistic dogmatic doctinal line, which you zealously and fervently memetically propagate every chance you get (and some you don't).  In fact, you're a fanatic about it, and perfectly fit into Sir Winston Churchill's definition of o!

Since I'm not an NRA member, I'm hardly 'in their thrall'. Frankly, I
don't think they are adamant enough. Since, as I said above, of all gun
crimes, less than 3% are committed by perps with legally purchased guns
(which includes guns bought at gun shows, which are a small percentage
of all gun purchases). Of course, the fact that so little crime is
committed with guns bought at gun shows does not in any way dissuade you
from ranting on and on. It seems to me that it is YOU who perfectly fit
into Churchills definition.

According to the Los Angeles Times
(http://www.latimes.com/business/20000724/t000069317.html), most of the
electronic copies were purchased by Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com which
then gave them away for free.  A survey of 3000 downloaders found that less
than 1% actually read the book.  They downloaded the "free" copies just to
be part of the novelty.

Nice rhetoric, but its not *quite* the same thing.  The main reason its 
illegal to counterfeit money is that the only purpose of counterfeit money 
is to use it to dupe people into giving you things and services of value for 
something which has no value.  In other words, its raison d'etre is to 
facilitate the commission of fraud.

The crime of counterfeiting has *nothing* to do with infringing the 
Government's copyright on the design of a dollar.  In fact the Government 
has never enforced its copyright on the design of money (although it 
arguably has the right to do so).  So long as your reproduction of money has 
no reasonable chance of being used to commit fraud (say, painting a larger 
than life size dollar bill on the side of a building) Uncle Sam won't give a 
hoot.

Graphic-artwork (don't come with the MP3);
Music video (don't come with the MP3);
Advertising campaign (I get no benefit from that);
sales tax (so far the net is still pretty much tax free, and that's fine by 
me)

True, the recording companies do perform the much needed job of filtering.  
However, looking at it from a cost-benefit analysis, I don’t think that 
service is worth the huge chunk of the cost of the CD that I pay for that 
service.  I think the filtering job could be done just as well (if not 
better) and much more efficiently by other methods.  Say commercial radio, 
word of mouth, etc.  So, while I agree with you that record companies will 
not be going away anytime soon, I for one would not be sad to see them go.

Gee I don't know.  Could it be that Chicago has a fairly large population of 
less-than-gainfully-employed, poorly educated, drug-abusing people with less 
than ideal family backgrounds, while the same is typically true to a 
significantly lesser extent in the 'burbs?

I do see a few butterflies on corn tassels, which are the male flower of the
corn plant. More commonly I see bees.  But, as Mike pointed out, corn is
mainly pollinated by wind.  I never see corn plants swarming with
butterflies and bees as I do insect pollinated plants such as, say, tree
huckleberry (_Vaccinium arboreum_).

Greywater is used household water containing limited amounts of waste
products. My city system included water from the washing machine, the
bathtub, the lavatory, and the kitchen sink.  Many people would eliminate
the kitchen sink, but in my case most food waste went to feed the chickens
or the compost pile rather than down the drain. Since I was living in a city
where such systems were against city ordinances, I had to conceal it so I
ran the water into a small pond covered with water hyacinths.  This turned
out to be an interesting experiment.  As long as I was careful not to put
anything toxic down the drains, the pond had no odor.  It was a gathering
place for frogs and toads, who took care of any mesquito larvae which
happened to hatch in the pond.  But whenever I used a toxic cleaning
product, the pond would take on a foul odor.  It was reassuring to see how
quickly the system would get back into sweet-smelling balance, with no
effort on my part. The pond was partly inside a greenhouse attached to the
southern side of the house (I'm in the northern hemisphere) and helped to
stabilize the temperature and maintain high humidity during the winter.

At my present house I run used water from the bathtub into a basin in which
I grow banana trees and other water-loving plants.  Water from the kitchen
sink goes into a high-carbon compost pile.

The genome for the bacterium that causes cholera has been sequenced.  Read
about it here:

http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/living/DailyNews/cholera0802.html

What's weird is the quote at the end: "Fraser added, though, that even
knowing the genetic makeup, it is an 'unrealistic goal' to wipe out
cholera."  What a pessimistic statement.  Almost as if the reporter is
making the sequencing irrelevant.

Mike, I don't know quite how to reply to this, or even if I should, but
since I've had a very personal experience with antibiotic resistant
bacteria, I guess I'll give it a shot.

Resistant bacteria are not killed by the antibiotic they're resistant to,
even if you give them a large dose.  I almost died from bilateral bacterial
pneumonia, because the bacteria were resistant to the antibiotics I was
given. I assure you I didn't stop taking the antibiotics.  They simply
didn't work. The disease just kept running its course as though I hadn't
taken antibiotics at all. At the hospital they gave me different antibiotics
which still didn't work. Far as I could tell, I got well on my immune system
alone, although it certainly helped to have the oxygen and glucose IV's.

Lessee; you claim that in-stste restrictions do not decrease the number of criminal acts committed with guns, while stating that out-of-state sources for criminals are negligible, and that few weapons for criminals are flowing in from out of country.

It will get rid of some of it (the guns bought by middlemen to sell at hiked prices to criminals).  I KNEW you'd reply; you just LUV to see that GUNS prefix on a message doncha?  You also know that my approach is to have purchase-prohibited lists that everyone must check; dealers, gun shows, flea markets, pawn shops, private sales, whatever, with toll-free numbers and websites requiring authorization by both buyer and seller to check, to avoid blackmail-type scenarios, and that charged or convicted violent criminals, the certified mentally challenged, emotionally unstable or deranged, and those under restraining orders should be included on the list, which should of course be appealable by due process.  Minors already cannot purchase, so that's not an issue.  I also like the idea of ballistically fingerprinting each new gun.

Actually, in the SAME AP article was the notation that the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence presented research that estimates that the Brady Bill restrictions saved 9368 lives between 1994 and 1998 because guns were less available to criminals.  Is that a fact?  And you're the one who called me a liar, Mr. Ad Hominem Man.  However, no one else mentioned that part of the article.  Now you'll predictably claim that that part is bullus shittus while the part you prefer is received gospel, right?  But no matter; even bad gun publicity onlist is gun publicity to you; you just LUV to see that precious GUNS prefix, and like Mao, with whom you seem to agree about the source of political power (a gun barrel, not a vote), you wanna see a thousand GUN-prefix flowers bloom onlist; it is your one enduring list purpose. Harvey Newstrom was right about you.

Yes, I realize this.  After investigating the legal differences between
employees, contractors, and fellowships, I learned that "fellowship" is
the best description for what I'll be doing, at least until an actual
multi-programmer project is launched.

Ultimately isn't that what your asking?  You said it yourself, IP laws are there
to protect the creative works of others in order for them to profit from it.
Before you get too hot and bothered I am playing devils advocate to see how far
this will go. The IP laws as they are currently written could allow people like
the RIAA to completely squelch progress.  In fact several astute lawyers have
said that Patel's decision could easily apply to the web itself.  After all, the
web allows people to transfer mp3's just like Napster does.  Yes, you and I know
that both technologies are slightly different. But have you bothered to read
current IP law and how judges like Patel and the RIAA are interpreting them? If
anyone is on a slippery slope here it is you.  Where is the line drawn?  Quite
frankly the lines being drawn are completely arbitrary and are at the whim of
those with the biggest money to throw at the legal system.  Might here does not
make right.

> Isn't there a nice reasonable attractor state somewhere between "absolute

I would hope so, but no one seems to be debating this as bluntly as I am.
Almost everyone says we must keep IP laws to protect creators, the economy, etc.
without seeing the full ramifications of what those IP laws can do when they are
abused.  I *am* questioning the who kitten caboodle, including the legal and
corporate system as it is now.  Lets play this out.

So your one of those people who wants to keep money monopolized by the Federal
Reserve?  Why then are you on the Extropian List?  Have you not heard of
encrypted anonymous e-cash?  What we really need is competing currencies!  If a
particular currency can be easily counterfeited, then yes it becomes devalued.
What's this does for the economy is loosen up how capital is controlled, by
democratizing the money supply.  In a competitive currency system, those
currencies with the best reputation and stability become the dominant players.
Besides who do you think are the greatest counterfeiters of US currency?  The US
government.  As soon as the gold standard was removed the US decided to print
themselves loads of it.  We are still trying to recover from such a debacle.

> Hmm, I'm not following this argument.  Would you mind trying again?

Quite simply the RIAA is using the current IP laws to protect their monopoly of
music distribution.  Only now after Napster are some of them willing to consider
another means of distribution.  Since the benefits of distributing music over
the internet are plain obvious, had their been true competition in the first
place, several companies would have already been doing this years ago.  Again,
here we see IP laws being used by those with the money to protect their
antiquated way of doing business.  Had their been true competition, I think the
overall quality of music would be much better than it is now, because competiton
assures that market forces (you and me) determine what music is played, not who
is hyped the most.

> Let me try to simplify it for you then:

OK this is getting really funny.  It's ok for me to record music for my own use
as long as that source contains advertising, but illegal and piracy if I record
music from non-adverstising sources?  I can just see it now, advertising becomes
compulsory!

No, what I'm saying is if the *only* thing motivating an artists is the pursuit
of money then maybe he shouldn't be an artist.  But lets get are facts straight,
most artists are prolific creators regardless of the money supply.  Most artist
actually enjoy the act of creation.  Sure I want them to make money.  But the
current monopolized recording industry does more to squash creative artists than
promote them.  Sure this is my opinion. but it is shared  overwhelming by the
majority of musicians (including myself) who I know.  And yes we are having
similar debates amongst ourselves at open-mike nights.

You seem to keep missing the point - physical and intellectual property are not
the same.  One is limited, the other can be replicated at next to no cost.
Please do not confuse them again.  Please see my car analogy if you need a
refresher. Duplication is not theft in any traditional sense of the word as much
as many would like to think it is. Lets get back to the real crux of this issue
- how not to destroy the economy and perpetuate technological progress in the
face of extremely cheap duplication costs.

> It appears to me that people who rail against the divide seem remarkably

Please tell that to the other 90% of the world who feel lucky for having clean
water and a place to live.  Sheesh!

> You say squash, I say foster.  You say these rules are crippling our growth,
> I say that they are responsible for it.  (Uh, we -are- growing, right?)

Now that we have the internet, IP laws will do more to cripple growth than help
it.  And I'm referring here to growth for the entire population not just the
ones at the top.  But this all begs the question that IP laws will become
increasingly difficult to enforce as the power of duplication continues to
multiply.  Napster smapster.  Now we have Gnutella, Freenet and Mojo Nation.
Either these advancing technologies will make IP law completely unenforceable
and irrelevant (my argument) or increasingly draconian measures will need to be
taken by the centralized governments of the world to maintain them (your
argument?).

Then why are these idiots at the RIAA using the current brunt of IP laws to
protect this antiquated way of doing business?  You would think they would get a
clue, and use the internet to streamline their business and minimize such
financial losses.

Again huh?  I see nothing wrong with advertising.  But when that's all I see,
because their using IP law to maintain their monopoly on music distribution then
I see a big problem.  Where is the competition?  When are we going to see music
that is determined more by market forces than market budgets?

Its time we all faced the facts, as technology gets better, things get cheaper.
Deflation is ultimately the sign of an advancing economy.  Just look at the
amount of computation a dollar buys now a days.  Amazing!  Follow the fill
circle of this argument.  If people are making less money from the acts of
creation, and those things are costing less then where is the harm done?  At
some point such an economy is inevitable, and there probably will be severe
dislocations and destabilization's along the way.  What we are experiencing now
is the equivalent of two revolutions exceeding all the changes that were brought
with the agricultural and industrial.

So its legal to copy as long as its a hassle, and illegal as long as its
convenient.  I can see it now, inconvenience becomes compulsory!  Wait a second,
I'm experiencing Deja Vu!!! (please see my last post)

I'm not advocating that we destroy the economic system.  These technologies are
going to advance whether you or I like it or not.  What I am advocating is that
we better get real about obsolete laws that neither function or are enforceable
in an age of cheap duplication costs.  Think of the internet as a rehearsal.
When nanotech arrives, we better have worked these issue out.

I agree with you in principle.  However time is running out.  Nanotechnology is
coming, and probably sooner than later.  I would rather we experience some
severe economic instabilities if it means that we have a chance of navigation
the nanotech waters without an apocalypse. Please see the extensive arguments
that I and many others made on http://nanodot.org/  about open-sourcing nanotech
research and development.

No I agree that the price is to high. But there is no sign that marketing is

You also know that my approach is to have purchase-prohibited lists that everyone must check; dealers, gun shows, flea markets, pawn shops, private sales, whatever, with toll-free numbers and websites requiring authorization by both buyer and seller to check, to avoid blackmail-type scenarios, and that charged or convicted violent criminals, the certified mentally challenged, emotionally unstable or deranged, and those under restraining orders should be included on the list, which should of course be appealable by due process.

I know that thats what you'd like to do for a start. I'm sure, like
Dianne Feinstein, "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate to ban
them all, I'd do it in a minute." (at the same time that she is the only
person in San Francisco with a concealed weapons permit, even after
committing several gun safety violations on nationwide television, and
endangering a room full of reporters with a fully loaded and unsafed
AK-47, with her finger right on the trigger.)

Then why is there so much gun violence by minors, according to your gun
control buddies?

WHich goes to show you know absolutely NOTHING about guns, because it is
supremely easy to alter the 'ballistic' fingerprint of a gun.

I guess you didn't read what I said. I understand what you are saying.
My own father has had repeat battles with a blood infection that swelled
up his legs like elephantiasis, and they had to bring out what his doc
calls 'the big guns' to finally whip it. What I was saying though, is
that if there were resistant strains in the meat, then those strains got
resistant due to an incomplete or insufficient treatment of antibiotics
IN THE COW (NOT you). So the point is, it suggests the farmer is not
giving the cow a sufficient dose of anti-biotics to wipe out the
bacteria, NOT that its wrong he's giving them it at all.

Wee-hoo!

"Evolution Foes Dealt a Defeat in Kansas Vote

By PAM BELLUCK
   
CHICAGO, Aug. 2 -- Voters in Kansas have repudiated
the state school board's removal of human evolution
from the state science standards, making it all but
certain that the decision will be overturned. 
In a Republican primary on Tuesday, the voters
defeated three conservative candidates who supported
the decision, made by the Kansas Board of Education a
year ago. 

They chose instead, in the first board election since
then, three moderate Republicans who pledged to return
evolution to the standards. And those three will be
running in November against Democrats who hold similar
positions."

"Today Mr. Frisby wore a tie that summed up his
feelings. It featured three see-no-evil, hear-no-evil,
speak-no-evil monkeys, with hands covering the eyes,
ears or mouth. A fourth monkey's mouth was agape"

Sorry Mike, but you dont know what you're talking about.  The more
antibiotics you use the more likely the bacteria will develop resistance.
Anti-biotic resistant strains of bacteria do not arise because the bacteria
adapt to a low level of antibiotic in their environment.  The strain arises
because some of the population are already resistant to that antibiotic and
it is their offspring which survive in that environment.  Giving cows more
antibiotics would make the situation worse, not better.

Sarcasm aside, you are basically correct. The people involved in
gun crime don't follow laws, so anti-gun laws are 100% ineffective.
Illinois has licensing, instacheck, waiting periods, and in
addition Chicago has a 19 year ban on handguns.... completely
ineffective.

Give me a map of Chicago and I could outline some areas in red,
others in yellow. As long as you never ventured into these areas
you would never see a gun or hear a gun shot.

Listen to what you are saying:

'the more anti-biotics you use, the more likely the bacterial will develop
resistance'

if this were so, then use of antibiotics on humans would have long ago developed
resistant strains. ALL doctors I talk to have said that resistant strains arise
as a result of patients not completing the full regimen of anti-biotics they are
prescribed, patients who stop taking them when they 'feel better', NOT when all
the pills are gone, which is how TB has gotten so resistant, and is primarily
found in a segment of the population least likely to take the advice of a
doctor: poor minority and homeless people. Dairy farmers, at least the ones I
know, are a VERY stingy lot. "Waste not, want not" and other such aphorisms are
their creed. I can completely believe that a farmer, being typically a rather
independent minded person,  would stop giving his cows anti-biotics when they
started looking better, and NOT when the Vet said to stop, thus likely creating
a similarly insufficient course of treatment that is likely to breed resistant
bacteria.

Actually Monarchs have a couple of mimics because of the fact that
they store milkweed toxin and are inedible. The Viceroy is the best
known of these and looks just like a Monarch only slightly smaller.
I don't know what they eat..... ;)

I downloaded RedHat linux for free from the FTP site.  I similarly
downloaded the NetBSD Unix-like OS.  This is totally legal and
encouraged.  RedHat tells you how to do it on their website.  I
believe you can also take the downloaded software, burn it on a CD,
and in fact sell it, all totally legally.

The only thing that buying the actual CD from RedHat gets you is,
according to the website:

Installation support

Priority Online Access for software updates

Printed manuals and Documentation CD

A large collection of some of the most popular Linux applications on
CD-ROM

Um, actually, as long as it's all GPL software, under the terms of the
GPL, you can do so totally legally.  (There may be some non-GPL
software in there, I guess, that you'd have to leave out, though the
core OS is all GPL.)  You can make all the copies of the GPL'ed code
you want and distribute them for any price you choose.  That's kind of
the point of the GPL.

Here's the license:

http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html

A key part is:

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights. 

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.  

You see the point?  The GPL makes it impossible to forbid someone from
redistributing your code.  RedHat *cannot* forbid you from
redistributing as many copies as you like at whatever price you choose
of any free software they sell.

Now, I don't know that this is true, but there may be some non-free
software bundled with the free software on the disk.  Presumably these
are not available on the FTP site.  In that case, you would have to
omit those particular programs from the copy you make.  But other
fully functional GNU/Linux distros include only free software,
e.g. Debian, (as does the RedHat FTP version, I assume).  And you
could totally legally burn your own copy and sell Debian CD's for
whatever price you choose.

I understand that there are people in the business of selling
copies of the RedHat distro for less than RedHat charges.  RedHat is
not trying to drive them out of business.  They're not in it for the
license fees.  That's just now how a free software business works.  

This is in fact the whole point of the GPL: to encourage people to
promiscuously share software, as long as they don't try to gain
control over it and limit others from doing so.

Regards,
James

Especially when the Chicago cops are supplying most of the illegal guns.

And any Chicago cop can tell you the same info, because the areas Brian talks
about are the areas they sell guns in.

Ok, perhaps that is what I see munching on the dung all the time. In any event,
as Ryan has said, since corn, in fact, doesn't cover all THAT much land area in
the Monarch flyways (primarily along the coasts), though I know it seems like
everything is corn to someone in Illinois. ;)

I would like to see what presence there is of this plant produced pesticide in
the nectar, if that is all they eat. If its only present in the leaves and
stalks, then its presence should be irrelevant for the butterfly.

Umm, sort of, mostly.

The story of J. S. G. Boggs and his dealings with the U. S. Secret
Service is so packed with questions about meaning and layers of
meaning that I can't possibly decode it here.  But suffice it to say
that he is a fine artist who paints U.S. and other currency and,
without attempting to defraud anyone, he has had his artworks
confiscated by the Secret Service.

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/julianmoseley/jsg_boggs.htm

Boggs seeks to "spend" his extremely realistic artwork, which closely
resembles actual Federal Reserve Notes, as a further act of
performance art.  He explains to store owners that this is not "real"
currency, but is real art.  (My favorite response was the store clerk
who counter-offered to sell Boggs an extrememly realistic looking
sculpture of the box a VCR comes in in exchange for the note when
Boggs tried to "buy" a VCR for some of his notes.)

No charges have been brought against him for counterfeiting, probably
because Boggs has never tried to deceive anyone.  However, the
U.S. government gets really uncomfortable about people who get so
close to these lines.  They are touchy about people imitating the
design elements, even when it seems clear that those people have not
tried to commit fraud.

Regards,
James

They have.  Why do you think there's such a race to develop new antibiotics?

Michael, you're making yourself look stupid.  While failure to complete the
full regimen of antibiotics is one factor, it's certainly not the whole
story. Por favor.  Do a little more research. Here's something to get you
started:

Excerpt: Factors Contributing to the Spread of Resistance
Three factors are of key importance in the emergence and spread of
antibiotic resistant bacteria: 1) mutations in common bacterial resistance
genes that have extended their spectrum of resistance; 2) exchange of
genetic information among bacteria; and 3) increase in selective pressures
in hospitals, other institutional settings, and in the community.

[what is the Meaning Of Life?]
okay, so here's my spin.

evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins introduced the idea of the
selfish gene, to explain the selection pressure by which creatures tend
to develop their instincts.  as humans, we are driven by more then the
need to reproduce, although many of our drives can still clearly be
explained by evolved inner needs, where it is our genes that are really
winning out - not "us".  the rest of the mess in our heads is neatly
explained by the idea that memes have emerged as another replicator,
evolving separate from our genes.  this idea is very well explained in:
   _The Meme Machine_ by Susan Blackmore.
   http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019286212X/rgrant

so, like the other answers, this one doesn't give you a Meaning Of Life
(that is, unless you are content being a slave to your genes, in which
case your mission is clear).  but it allows you to see where the burning
question comes from...

i think this tends to make questions of whether an individual's actions
are "selfless" less meaningful.  actions serve some memes installed in
that individual's head, or they fulfill a biological motive (which may
include acting for for the benefit of relatives, if an individual is
not acting directly for themselves).

after all that, if you decide the thing for you to do is improve your
happiness... well, have at it.

- Ryan

In fact the nanobots have been mentioned many times, along with showing
many times how the borg assimilate beings by injecting them in the neck
with the bots. Anyone who watches any trek would be pretty familiar with
it all. What, you haven't been watch all those Voyager eps? :-)

You can't give enough antibiotics to sterilize an organism unless
it's in an isolation chamber.  No matter how much antibiotics 
the farmer pumps into the cow, there will always be bacteria 
there and they will be very prone to develop resistance.  Once
they're resistant, you can't even sterilize the cow *in* an
isolation chamber.

We have a new movement afoot: economic luddites. "We've always used 
paper money to pay for shiny plastic disks, and that's how it should
forever remain, darn it!"

Luckily, there is something coming down the pipe that just might make
econo-luddites and info-anarchists agree with each other. Namely,
micropay.  MoJoe is not the last, nor is it taking things quite to
their logical conclusion...  wait a few months and you will see.
Micropay will make the "information wants to be free" people happy
because the miniscule size of the payments introduces minimal friction
to the flow of information.  Micropay will make the "information
providers want to eat" people happy because these tiny payments can
certainly add up when collected from thousands of users who barely miss
them individually. Micropay will make ISPs and sysadmins happy because
a tiny fraction of each tiny payment can be deducted to pay for the
maintenance of infrastructure, which is currently subsidized by
cost-recovery portions of businesses, or by the government.  The only
ones who will be unhappy will be the IP lawyers and those parts of the
entertainment and software industry that are too set in their ways to
adjust to this next iteration of capitalism... and they deserve to be 
unhappy.

Actually, I think you can.   Check www.cheapbytes.com , which sells lots
of Linux and related stuff roughly at the costs of reproduction (even
"Linux By The Pound"). They have a whole "Red Hat" corner.  The $40-80 that "Official" Red Hat costs is largely for the support RH supposedly

topic.

http://134.76.234.216/DetailsScientificProgram/b0.1-pedas1..oral.htm

B0.1/PEDAS1 Space Debris

Operations in Earth orbit have generated both large and small
particulates which remain in orbit for extended periods and cause a
flux which exceeds the interplanetary meteoroid flux. The meeting will
address techniques to measure the space debris and near-Earth
meteoroid population, the results of data taken from the ground and in
space to measure the environment, the results of analyses of
spacecraft returned from space, methods and results of modeling and
supporting ground tests to predict the environment over short and long
time intervals, and atmospheric reentry of orbiting objects including
the fragmentation process. The meeting will also discuss hypervelocity
impacts, the effects of impacting debris on spacecraft structures and
instrumentation, and detrimental effects of space debris on space
activities and research, e.g. astronomy. The meeting will examine new
developments which may influence the debris environment such as
satellite constellations. Measures will be addressed to reduce the
growth of the debris population and keep the hazard to operational
spacecraft within tolerable limits.

>Is the situation with microparticles going to get continually worse
>over some time frame?

Yes. 

Since 1957, more than 4000 space launches have occurred. About 8500
objects, larger than 10cm are being tracked in Earth orbit, only
about 700 of those are spacecraft. About 100 000 to 150 000 objects,
larger than 1cm, are not being tracked.

Objects 1cm and larger can destroy a spacecraft. Those particles, can
easily have relative velocities of tens of km/sec, which act like a
bullet hitting the spacecraft.

[For example, About the small particles that worry spacecraft
operators: the Cassini mission designers are planning now the Saturn
ring-plane crossing sequences, about 5 years from now, and yes indeed,
they are worried about the big dust particles >1cm, that they might
encounter. Of course us dust people want to sample the dust, but we
like the "smaller" dust, and we certainly don't want the spacecraft
damaged!]

>Are the negative potentials in themselves harmful to vehicles either in or 
>transiting through the magnetosphere? 

Yes. Portions of spacecraft have been observed to charge to many
kVolts (negative) during Earth substorms and those spacecraft surfaces
can suffer discharges. However, spacecraft surfaces are *supposed* to
be (designed) nonconducting, but sometimes they are not. The ones that
are not could experience difficulties.

I've heard stories of objects from Earth orbit being brought back to
Earth for examination (for example, solar panels from HST), and the
objects stored charges for months (process: "internal charging"),
resulting in a strong electrical discharge when someone/something
tried to handle the object.

A good old reference:
_Photon and Particle interactions with Surfaces in Space_
R.J.L. Grard, editor, Reidel, 1973.

Thank you for a fun post. What wonderful imagery.

Being UN-ROMAN, Kounterkultur Kids, we're waiting patiently outside the walls.
 
(In other words I am one of the pathetic eye/earballs who cannot really 
afford the full price CD, have to go to matinees, and buy used computers from 
Extropians ; ) I;ve been given more free music in my life than I could 
Napster in a year! ...on tape at first, now CD. 

Yet, I am more cynical. While I also really enjoy watchin' the game (havin' a 
bud) of the earballs vs. the suits....

What I am surprised no one has said is: perhaps the whole Napster thing is a 
huge publicity stunt, and they've been in bed with the record companies......

So the 'Official' Red Hat CANNOT be reproduced, and I cannot sell or give away
the work of Red Hat (whether its their programming work or their Customer
Support work is really irrelevant, and a pointless distinction) without
compensating them to the degree they desire.

>From the cited paper:

 "Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in hospitals, other institutions, and in the
community
increase selective pressures for resistant bacteria to emerge." In this context,
overuse meaning that it is used too widely, on an indiscriminate basis and that
it is misused, i.e. the full course of treatment is not applied, NOT that too
much is given to specific patients (so says two doctors I know, Dr. Joseph
Cecere and Dr. Robert Kroner, as well as my mother, Karen Lorrey, a former
Medical Technologist,ASPC, and currently Director of Quality and Compliance at
Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital). This statement directly supports what I have
been saying. While there have been mild/minor selective pressures in hospitals
since the 60's among atmospherically and contact communicable diseases, these
were only a small fraction of a percent of all infections until 1995. The reason
these diseases underwent selective pressures in hospitals was NOT because of
antibiotics at all, but because hospital environments are, despite constant
efforts at cleanliness, the area one is most likely to catch an airborne or
contact communicable disease, simply because there are so many sick people
there.

Okay, well this is a -new- argument.  The first argument was that we could
steal music because we weren't physically taking it from someone-- an
argument by which counterfeiting should also be allowed.

The -above- argument says that we shouldn't counterfeit money because it's
fraud.  It doesn't say -why- we shouldn't commit fraud, but I'm guessing its
because you believe that getting (your words:) "services of value for
something which has no value" is wrong.

I appreciate you making my argument for me.

Cheers!

No, I compared YOUR fears and level of alarmism to similar levels of

about nuclear power and nuclear war. I did NOT compare GM to H-bombs. Please
re-read what I posted.

Sellafield, three mile island, chernobyl .... need i go on? surely the

Unfortunately there aren't big agri bucks to be made out permaculture ....

Irrelevant and pointless to you maybe, not to Linux hackers who don't want to
spend time downloading but also don't need handholding and don't want to pay for
it.  For them, all they need is the CD.  My understanding is that it's the
customer support work that they're selling for your $40-80 or whatever, and that
makes it "official", i.e. you have to register the "official" package to talk to
them.  You also get a manual.  I don't know the distributability of the manual
offhand - I'd expect it's copyrighted.   You can reproduce Linux (and whatever
else comes on the CD) as much as you want under the terms of the licenses of that
software - GPL and variants.   You're free then to offer whatever support you want
to provide, including none, at whatever terms you want.   Cheapbytes provides
none.   Such software that Red Hat itself has added to its Linux distribution (not
much, but RPM really makes life easier)  is under the GPL or comparable license as
far as I'm aware; that's why Cheapbytes, and you, can distribute it.   I think
they do have some products which are not distributable that way, but I don't
follow their product line that closely to be sure.  Clearly, though, they're
mainly in the business of selling _support_ - someone to call when things break,
rather than original software.

Okay, okay.  (Mr. Poopy Pants.)

No, no really, you're right, let's be civil.





Okay, I snipped a big chunk here where you say that -I'm- on the slippery
slope because the lines are drawn in arbitrary places, etc, etc.

My only response to this is to sort of shrug and say, well, it's
complicated!

People seem to have a problem with that, but as I've posted earlier, I'm
willing to accept that we need complex rules to facilitate the increasingly
intricacy of our dealings with each other.  I'm not excited about the
prospect of getting bogged down in details, but my feathers aren't
especially ruffled at the concept of 'grey areas' of IP.

I agree that the current system is not perfect.  I think it's going to need
to change very quickly to keep up.  I'd be interested in trying to solve
that problem.  But I don't think the solution is simply to abandon IP.

On this thread I'd say that there are way more people arguing -against- IP
than -for.-  But maybe I'm just hearing the wolves at the door...

Which reminds me... I was going to start to look for a gracious way to
extricate myself from this debate...

Argh!  Damn, I just cut my... uh... fingers... on the... uh sharp corners of
my... uh... keyboard!  Just... enough... energy left... to finish...
message....



But lets get are facts straight,

Okay, well since you're getting your facts straight, where do you get this
data from?

Sure this is my opinion. but it is shared  overwhelming by the
> majority of musicians (including myself) who I know.

Are you a professional musician?  Are your friends professional musicians?
I ask because the overwhelming majority of all of the professional artists
that I work with are in favor of IP.  Uh... you know, cause they like to get
paid for their work.  I'd be interested to hear the point of view of people
who sell their music for a living and are in favor of removing IP.

I'm sorry, I'm very slow.


  Please see my car analogy if you need a

I did, and I'm quite refreshed now, thank you.

Please feel free to wade back over the 40+ some pages I've written on this
subject to the list.  If you go back far enough, you'll discover some of my
arguments against making the distinction you make above.  IMHO it's -all-
going to be intellectual property eventually... well, most of it, anyway.

I'm not happy about the living conditions of those 90%.  But the question
remains: would conditions on this planet have turned out better if we never
implemented the concept of ownership over things?  Again, I think
Communism -is- successful at equalizing things-- it just equalizes everyone
at a lower level.




Well, you say lots of other clever things that need rebuttal, but to be
frank, my heart's not in it.

It's not your fault, but the same things keep getting said over and over
again and it's, uh, kinda getting boring, for everyone I'm sure.

And when it's -not- boring, it makes me sit and type -way- too much.

And I gotta work or else the bad credit card men will come and take my
computer away.

As it says in the article...

Is there anything else I can do to protect my family from antibiotic-resistant
bacteria?
    Yes, there are some other steps you can take: 
       a) When prescribed an antibiotic, take all pills in the bottle. Do not
stop taking the pills when you start to feel better. 
       b) Never keep and save unused antibiotics. A family should never have
bottles of unused antibiotics sitting in their medicine chest. 
       c) Never share antibiotics with your family and friends. You will do more
harm than good.

Uh.... I dunno... are dissenting views not welcome here?

Do you have to be an Extropian to post here?

If so, my humble apologies-- there appears to be a heretic in your midst.



Although... actually, I don't *think* I want money monopolized by the
Federal Reserve... hmm... is that a -bad- thing?  It sounds bad.  Maybe I
don't want that then.

I'd be happy to chuck a few cents out there too.

The major problem at the moment with information wanting to be free, is that
this means it will be free (notice the clever lack of contextual clues,
which means it is impossible to understand what I mean).

There's a meme that its ok to get everything which can be transmitted as
information for zero cost. Mostly, this is a culture which has stemmed from
years of existence of a commercial internet where it is hard to pay, but
easy to steal.

Personally, I do it too. It's an issue of timeliness (not timelines); when
you are looking for information these days, often the deciding criterion is
"what can I get my hands on in the next five minutes". It's a busy time, we
are busy people.

Commerce tends to work best if it is easier to pay than steal. So either we
need to make it harder to steal (approaching impossible), or make it easier
to pay. I'm sure Napster would love to have existed in an environment where
a micropayment infrastructure was ubiquitous. I am convinced people would
pay, say, 10cents to download a song, or a piece of writing. If it's easier
to find the legitimate version than the illegitimate version, then that is
all the more likely. Even if it is only as easy to find and pay for a legit
version, or even if it is only almost as easy, as it is to download a
bootleg, many of us will still pay up. We already pay for many of the "free"
services out there anyway (except for all those people who swear they are
unaffected by advertising - what strength of character!). 10c per download
in return for a quality, ad-free service? Sure. We need ecash.

I'm sure it will come together in the near term. More and more large orgs
are feeling the squeeze from the "information wants to be free" memeset,
which has lost it's "information wants to be expensive" suffix. There are a
lot of dollars ready to replace that with "information wants to be cheap".
Let's hope it comes together soonish.

Utter nonsense. I can have all the same bits without the pretty box for
free if I grab it off their ftp server, minus some non-free added value
junk. I can install it on as many machines as I want, I can burn CDs and
pay you to take them from me, I can call it some thing else and start a
company putting it a different box. (Witness Mandrake.) 

Calling the distinction between software and support pointless is
insanity. The software is free, paying a human being to help you use it or
adapt it to your purposes isn't. That's the whole freaking free-software
business model - that's what RMS has been talking about for years.

...

Well, no, and sorry if I phrased the "what you get" part incorrectly
or ambiguously.  I believe the way it works is this:

By buying the shrink-wrapped RedHat box, you get the same software you
can get for free from the FTP site.  You can legally distribute that.
In fact, Red Hat is legally forbidden from stopping you -- it's mostly
made up of stuff they merely bundled from someone else that comes with
the GPL attached, and they'd be in trouble for trying to stop you from
redistributing it, which is what they've done after all; redistributed
somebody else's GPL'ed code.

However, the "extra" value you get for buying the actual CD from Red
Hat in the nice Red Hat shrink-wrapped box for the full Red Hat price
is their printed matter, installation support, the priority access for
updates, etc.  I don't know if this comes in the form of a certificate
with a unique RedHat cusomter ID #, or the proof of purchase number on
the box or whatever, but this is the one thing that a reseller cannot
provide.  (At least, not legally.)

So in some sense I won't get the same thing if I buy the "Lorrey
Special Edition Red Hat Linux" distro for $5.99, act now, limited
offer, sales tax may apply.   :-)  I certainly won't get all those
items RedHat offers only to their own customers.

But I will get the core RedHat distro OS source and object code,
suitable for installation on my PC.  And I don't think Red Hat can
legally stop you from going into that business should you so choose,
nor do I think they'd want to stop you.  Moreover, I believe some
people are in that business -- cut-rate Red Hat CD's -- and Red Hat
has not tried to stop them.

So Red Hat is not trying to stop people from getting their Linux
distro for free, or even from redistributing it for money -- in fact
they in some sense encourage this by making the code available for
free FTP.  They are trying, however, to encourage people to pay the
$40 or whatever for the support, manuals, etc.

All the best,
James

SInce I work most of my time at a software company, I know there is functionally
no difference between the two. All the 'free' business model is doing is some
sort of hacker-leach lotus eating paradise, where people that know what they are
doing get the software for free, and the unit COST of producing that software
the distro distributor is externalized through the tech support process to make
the clueless pay for the free software the geeks are using. RedHat still has to
pay its programmers to produce code. Instead of making everyone pay their fair
share of the cost of producing that code that everyone benefits from, they make
the newbies pay for it all.

I happen to use SuSE on two machines, and have not used support (its not like
their support is any good for me, considering they rarely supply english manuals
on their distros). Neither I, nor You, are 'everyone'. Microsoft gives away its
Internet Explorer as well, but they only give support to those that pay for it.
MS-DOS is effectively freeware as well, under similar circumstances. In both
cases, my selling 'official' MS versions with included support is illegal, just
as it is illegal for me to sell 'official' RedHat distros that include support.

You are trapped in the hacker mindset that everyone is an expert, when they most
certainly are not. A non-official distro is useless to a non-expert, which means
its useless to most people.

Sellafield? Nothing. TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid 'test' by
your socialist buddies. The lesson of Chernobyl is that socialists can't be
trusted with nuclear power. THe lesson of TMI is that US nuclear plants are safe
systems even under the worst failure conditions.

Which has shown tons of evidence that it is perfectly safe there. Humans have
been introducing genetically modified agricultural species into the environment
for millenia. The only difference between then and now is then we were rolling
the dice with the genes in our breeding programs, while now we have a very exact
idea of what we are getting. Its quite clear that GE programs are far safer than
the hybridization programs humans have been running for thousands of years.
Anyone who knows ANYTHING about agriculture knows that.

How do you know what their interests are? Their stockholders are interested in
making money, surely, or else they would not be investing in those companies. I
fail to see why such an obviously obsolete socialist argument needs any reply,
at least on this list.

The second sentence is undoubtedly true, which is probably why few people outside the
Linux hacker community have heard of Cheapbytes and the like, or would buy (or be well
served by) a CD-only (sans manual & support) distro.

(as an aside: I run RedHat at home; I've been doing Unix sysadmin and development for
quite a while so I'm comfortable muddling through - and I certainly wouldn't wish any
Linux distro I've seen on your average Windows user.)

I just *can't* let a faulty argument go by without making a comment.  Call 
it a character flaw.  But anyway...

Getting something for nothing is not necessarily "wrong."  If I give you my 
lunch because I happen to think you're a neat person, and you take my lunch 
and eat it, neither of us has committed a moral lapse.  On the other hand, 
if you print-out from your computer a bogus, but realistic-looking, front 
row ticket to lollapalooza and tell me it will get me into the concert and 
that you'll give it to me in exchange for your lunch, and by means of this 
trickery you hoodwink me out of my lunch, it is clear that you will have

I can't copy an engineer at zero cost - that's a rather important
functional difference between software and support/maintenance.

I write a piece of software and give it away, free of charge, to anyone
who can use it. I have things I'd rather spend my afternoon doing than
setting it up on your PC but for a few bucks - sure - I'll give you a
hand. 

Obviously I'm a hacker-leach, victimizing the clueless.

Linux was built on support money, unfairly extracted from unjustly
burdened, exploited newbies? Gcc and the Gnu tool set? X-Windows? Kde and
Gnome? Apache? What the hell are you talking about?

This is probably still true, but Linux is getting much easier to install
and much easier to use - the changes over just the last couple of years
have been incredible. That said though - I wouldn't wish Windows on the
average Windows user either.

Okay, I'm going to read your argument as being that it's okay if I take
something from you without your permission as long as you don't lose
anything.  Believe it or not, I can actually agree with that statement.  The
question is-- do _you_ agree with it?

I have to ask because it has implications: namely, if I can show that
you -do- lose something when I take your intellectual property, you're
obliged to either withdraw the argument (or refine it, or whatever) or agree
that stealing IP is bad.

...and I'm guessing that I -don't- need to show ways in which you lose when
I take your intellectual property, because you seem fairly sharp and I bet
you can come up with a bunch yourself.

...but here's a simple one to get you started:  I write a book.  You want
the book.  You make a free digital copy of the book.  You don't pay me for
the book.  I lose you paying for my book.


Surely we can discuss value in intelligent terms and in reference to things
other than material objects?  I don't need to break down your door and eat
stuff out of your fridge in order for you to experience 'loss.'

WHich is bogus. While I got my start with computers as a kid, I stopped
using them for many years until I left the USAF. At that point was when
Windows 2.0 was out, and 3.0 was coming out. Installing Windows 3.1 on a
virgin machine was very easy, and every windows install since then has
been easier.

Ah, but if you were making your living as a balogna sandwich maker, you

No, you aren't. The people who don't hire you to help them are
benefitting from the fact that you only bill the clueless for your time,
thus the clueless are subsidizing the software of those who don't need
help with it. What you are practicing is a reverse sort of technological
socialism, where the people with the intellectual capital (the hackers)
pay the least, while the intellectually poor (the newbie) pays the most.
Its a highly regressive tax system, which is odd coming from people who
tend to be socialists politically.

That's a fairly twisted way of looking at the world, and while internally
coherent it has nothing to do with reality.

Most free software is written by hobbiests - there is no 'cost',  no more than
fooling around in your garage woodshop constitutes capital expenditure which
has to be recouped. If you get a kick out of of building spice racks, if it's
something you enjoy doing in your free time, and you have a magic wand for
duplicating them at zero cost, why not just be a nice guy and give them away?
If some one offers you $20 to nail one up in his kitchen, he's not subsidizing
anything, he's buying a non-free service that you're unable to provide him at
zero cost.  Very few people  are lucky enough to make a living doing free
software - most have day jobs. We hack on things it's fun to hack on, and
when we come up with something neat, we send in a patch.

Most free software support is bought by large companies working on large
projects, not struggling individuals. If I'm writing software with gcc, I need
someone who can fix bugs I find, add capabilities I need, and port it to
platforms I need to support. If a critical system runs Linux, I need someone to
call when it goes down and someone who can configure it so it doesn't. If I
want to serve thousands of hits per second on an Apache webserver, it's worth
my while to have it set up by someone who really knows the ins and outs of that
particular piece of software. When we talk about support as a business model,
we're not talking about 900 numbers for struggling newbies, we're talking about
businesses for whom it doesn't make sense to maintain the relevant talent in
house. If anyone's subsidizing free software, it's corporate users.

I don't know who these people are. People buying Redhat with support for about
what they'd spend on Windows? If you don't have the background to get
anything out of Linux after 90 (?) days of support, it probably isn't the right
tool for the job you're trying to get done. Qualified people picking up phones
aren't free. Till AI, we're just going to have to deal with that.

I work full time for a free software company, Ada Core Technologies. (Whom I
don't speak for and so on.) We maintain Gnat, the Gnu Ada compiler. It's
how I make my living. I suspect I know more about the free software business
than you do.

Sure, I never claimed there was anything particularly difficult about
installing Windows. I'm sure you'd have no trouble installing any of the
recent Linux distributions either, it's about as effortless as the process,
by it's nature, can reasonably be. That's true whether you paid $5 at
cheapbytes or $45 for a box and a manual. 

Installation is a strawman anyway: The non-technical PC user buys a machine
with something installed, and there it stays till a techy friend upgrades it or
the machine dies. Windows is almost certainly easier for the non-technical user
to work with than Linux, at this point, but I think you'd be amazed if you took
a look at what KDE and GNOME have accomplished.

There's an article by John Gilmore on the nanodot board at
http://nanodot.org/articles/00/07/27/2219252.shtml which looks at
the IP debate in the context of future nanotech.

Jason Joel Thompson has pointed out here that nanotech may eventually
make it possible to cheaply create material objects given information
about their designs, in which case most of the economy would involve
trading intellectual property.  IP issues will therefore become ever
more important as we move to an era where the only thing that matters
is information.

Jason's perspective is that this will be a disaster if we don't have a
way to protect ownership of IP, and therefore we should come up with
institutions today that protect the forms of IP that we have now, so
that in the future we will be able to have a functioning economy.

The article by John Gilmore follows much the same reasoning, but comes to
exactly the opposite conclusion.  John, like Jason, sees today's threats
to IP as portending a future society where all productive efforts will
face similar forms of piracy.  Rather than fighting this trend, though,
he seeks ways to live with it.

John made one of his many fortunes through his company Cygnus Solutions,
one of the first businesses to make money off of "free software".
Cygnus sold versions of the Gnu development tools (compilers, debuggers,
etc.), packaged for various architectures, along with technical support.
This is the same basic business model used by RedHat and some other
companies today, but Gilmore started it almost 20 years ago.

His experience no doubt teaches him that you *can* make money off of
software which is given away for free; the millions of dollars in his
bank account attest to that.

John suggests that if we don't solve the IP problem, the advent of
nanotech will lead to exactly the kind of disaster Jason is predicting:

   Nanotech threatens to apply the same economics to physical goods --
   very cheap copying after relatively expensive creation. If our economy
   is not to crash immediately after assemblers arrive (resulting in
   many hungry people rioting or warring), society needs to learn how to
   structure an economy to support the expensive part while letting the
   cheap part provide its benefits of broad distribution of the results.

However, he believes that the efforts by the RIAA and other copyright
owners to preserve antiquated IP laws will only make matters worse:

   Intellectual property law, and expected business practice, is being
   driven by the entertainment middleman industry in exactly the wrong
   direction: Artificially restricting computers and citizens so that they
   will not make the copies that they are very good at making. Following
   this path will lead the economy to a massive dislocation (much
   bigger than the record companies' dismay about Napster and MP3 --
   record companies' sales today are greater than ever). Almost nobody
   understands this yet.

The solution he sees is to move society towards acceptance of the open
source philosophy in all areas of human endeavor.  Only in that way can
we move into a nanotech economy without a crash, and allowing everyone to
share in the fruits of the new technology:

   If even a third or a half of the economy is running on open source
   principles before assemblers start assembling more assemblers, we
   can probably avoid war and worldwide civil unrest.

John says that much of his interest in the open source software movement
and IP issues in general is because of his concerns about the transition
to nanotech.  I wonder how long ago he realized that his business model
could play such a significant role in the future economy.

I'm not really in favor of institutional protection in the long term, but I
have yet to articulate exactly what I am in favor of.  More on this later.

I see the 'trend' as entropy, and, yes, I do think we should fight it.

But the way I want to fight it involves using it, which means there may be
points of commonality between John's philosophy and my own.

And clearly he won't be the last to make lots of money off of these sorts of
new business models.  But I believe the ways in which people make money off
of free software are available to them (increasingly!) in world with 'not'
free software.

Hmm, well I've never been a big fan of most uses of the words 'artificial'
and 'natural.'  I'm an advocate of creating a new form of 'smart'
information that is not only data, but meta-data... that is to say, it
contains rules that govern it's own behavior... if that's 'artificial,' then
so be it.  If we need to create a social contract to protect information
until we get there, then I can probably go along with that too.

 Following

I try to avoid strong predictive statements because I'm all too aware of how
superfluid the next ten years are going to be.  IMO we don't have good
benchmarks by which to make statements like "following this path will lead
the economy to a massive dislocation."  (And actually, I'm not quite sure
what that means...)  However, I'll grant that it ain't much fun if we don't
get to take a few stabs in the dark... so on!

Wow.  Now we're gettin' into the big stuff.  Okay, well let me try to
articulate a contrary viewpoint.

This isn't fully formed yet folks,  so I hope a few broad strokes will
suffice:



For a moment, lets empty our heads of some of the commonly held beliefs with
regards to information in the Internet age: foremost, the idea that
"information wants to be free," but also the whole realm of wide-eyed dotcom
day-dreamiery: free, anonymous, infinitely self-replicating, frictionless
information.  I would call this sort of information "dumb, nameless,
randomly replicating information with no rules."  Let's refer to it as
Dinfo.  (dumb info)

Lets consider instead a nearly antithetical type of information: smart,
named, intelligently replicating information with rules.  Information that
knows who made it.  Information that can be inherently possessed of rules.
Sinfo.

Let's forget for a moment that proper Sinfo requires technology that we
don't currently have yet-- let's instead just sit back and play a mind game
with Dinfo and Sinfo.

At first glance the biological parallel to Dinfo is cancer, whereas Sinfo
seems to have some strong correlation to the gene.  To be more precise:
cancer replicates uncontrollably without good feedback mechanisms to control
its behavior, whereas the gene has some very specific rules about how it can
multiply, with what it can interact, and to "whom" it belongs.

Cancer clearly is the master of unrestrained growth.  The gene, on the other
hand, must make use of a tremendously complicated higher order emergent
system in order to perpetuate itself.  It follows an exceedingly intricate
and precise set of instructions in order to develop a complex adaptive
vehicle for itself: life.

Without straining the analogy further, the point is simply this: rules +
complexity + selection pressure = emergence.  Unrestrained growth is a
negative attractor state-- one into which I fear we are being rapidly drawn.

Okay, okay, like I said, this is just going to be some broad strokes, so let
me move in a slightly different direction.

Sinfo knows who made it.  It knows where its been.  Copies may be
functionally indentical, but -they- "know" they're different.  Some of it
follows rules.  Some of the rules are extremely complicated: On Thursday you
can hang out with Bob's Sinfo, but on Friday you have a son and then commit
suicide.  Some Sinfo lets you copy it indefintely.  Some you can only copy
once, some not at all.

When you build Sinfo you can make it as free or as "owned" as you want.  You
are empowered to create information with a legacy, that knows that you made
it, that won't let anyone else copy it precisely, and you can free it into
the environment to prosper or perish.

Now, I think there's a whole realm of inherent advantages to this model, but
I'm not going to get into all of them here, 'cause that's a whole book
folks.  We've discussed some of the big issues already on this list.  But I
do want to point out what I consider to be one of the biggest pluses to
Sinfo:

You can write yourself into it.

I know that this is the kiss of death for the "information wants to be free"
advocates, and it's the precise reason why I am not among that group:  Even
if totally free information is wildly successful (especially if!) the bad
consequence is that it doesn't care about it's creator.  We would live in a
state of making superficial use of the massive information network that has
coelesced around us, unable to control or affect it, passive bystanders to
an ongoing process that may very well write its own rules eventually (become
Sinfo!) and just simply evolve past us.  A robust undiscipled cancer.

Optionally, we hardcode ourselves into the information-- in fact, we make
the "smartness" fundamental to the information.  Every thought that comes
out of your brain becomes an extension of you, as opposed to an anonymous
dust mote in the cyclone.  The system that is the "creator" becomes
inextricably linked to the data that is the "created."  Widespread
empowerment of ideas in the frictionless matricies of the future give you
exposure to limitless designer ideas, with a direct positive feedback loop
to the "creator" based upon your successful use of the "created."

In the attention economy, you probably won't want to prevent copying of your
information, even if you could-- you get 'paid' everytime someone takes a
look.  But maybe some uncopiable Sinfo swirls around the matrix-- absolutely
precious, diamond sharp and outrageously valuable.  If you have to work hard
to get it, then...*you'll work hard to get it!*  It won't be free or easy or
infinite but will instead require considerable innovation on your part to
procure.

Okay, well it's obvious I could on (and on, and on...)

The primary objection to Sinfo is likely to be on grounds of practicality.
(Think of all the overhead...!)  But I'd argue that its worth all the
overhead... all that meta-data that appears to be slowing the information
down is actually integral to all sorts of emergent success.  Kind of like
the government.  :)

This does mean that we have to give up some control, in favor of interesting
rules.  And if the technology isn't good enough to make those rules work,
then, again, yep, I am in favor of social engineering to make it happen.

But I really don't think the technology is impossible.  I really don't.  I
actually do think that the gene is a good example of a working model.  The
gene is really just information-- written into a less plastic substrate:
physical reality.  I'd like to copy and improve upon its success in the
media of the future.

But maybe I'll do that tomorrow, 'cause right now I gotta go to sleep.

Night all.

Well all the years you have spend in frustration, at the cost of family and

McDonalds has just been wasted.

Well one / a few persons experiences does not make a it truth. It only shows
that some people/companies can make money that way. It does not show the way
of the world. 

All the .com's doing free software are not exactly making buckloads of
money. I guess we will se a pattern emerging in a few years where it will be
more obvius if it's a viable business model.

Sinfo and Dinfo?

Ok, I gotta ask: if I "buy" a piece of music online, dowload it 
and play it on my computer; and, if it is "protected" so that i 
can not make extensive copies of it...

 What's to keep me from playing it (I'm still allowed to listen 
to it, right?), recording it on a cassette recorder, re-
converting that to a digital format, and distributing thousands 
of copies free? True, that's a little involved, but the principle 
seems sound. Unless you seriously cripple my computer, I should 
be able to strip any "protection" from your smart information, 
and any other kind of information floating out there.

 What's to keep a "free information" group from doing just that, 
for the "benefit of the public"? They could purchase one copy of 
everything, then distribute thousands for free, regardless of 
your "protection".

post the whole thing, but restrained myself, it can be found at
www.seedsofchange.com


----------------------------------------------------------
*A farmer's lament
----------------------------------------------------------
Don Dunklee, an organic grower in Michigan, submitted the following
article to our eGroup Forum

Counterpoint: milkweeds, monarchs and genetically modified
agriculture.

I am a farmer. I knew that since I was 5. I grow crops. The land I
farm also grows butterflies, birds, earthworms and wildflowers, or
at least now I think it is supposed to. Right now I am having
trouble figuring out what kind of farmer I am or should be. This
question is not just for me, but for everyone. I am concerned that
there is no room for bluebirds and butterflies in big precision
genetically modified-producing agriculture, described in an April
30-May 3 Star Tribune series.

In 1995 I thought I was going to be a big farmer and rented land
from one side of the county to the other. I guess the best way to
characterize attitudes about faraway rented land is you don't find
yourself putting up birdhouses on it. It is an economic decision.
We live in the middle of our farm. When you live on the land you
farm, you find yourself wanting to plant trees and put up
birdhouses. Sometimes the weeds are wildflowers that the bugs
treasure, and you and your kids bring them into your house and
cherish them.

Twelve years ago, I rented land that had sat idle for two years. It
was full of weeds -- annual weeds, perennial weeds, lots and lots
of milkweed, classic big huge milkweeds. The battle began.

For a number of years, I never really got on top of those milkweeds
and they never really got on top of the crop. One year I put the
field in wheat and had a chance to end it for the milkweeds. The
timing of the herbicide application would have to be perfect. It
rained when I was supposed to spray.

Looking back, I think this was supposed to happen. I would drive by
that field and try not to look at those oh-so-healthy milkweeds.
Finally one day I stopped to look at my wheat and milkweed field.
Nearly every milkweed had a monarch butterfly caterpillar on it.
Milkweed is the sole host of the monarch butterfly caterpillar. We
didn't make much off the wheat, and nearly choked on the milkweed
fuzz in the straw, but took solace in knowing we raised a good crop
of monarchs that year.

In 1997, Roundup Ready genetically engineered soybeans became
widely available. Roundup herbicide kills everything green except
the soybeans with the genetic alteration. The application window is
huge. I grew some of these soybeans. The milkweeds are gone. I
didn't stop to think about this until the summer of 1999 when it
was reported that pollen from Bt corn, another genetically
engineered crop, was getting on the milkweed in field borders and
may be killing the monarch butterfly caterpillars. I found myself
hoping that the offspring of the monarchs I had displaced had not
wound up next to a Bt corn field. Odds are they will. Before
Roundup Ready genetic engineering, it was difficult to kill
milkweed in crops. My milkweeds are gone. My neighbor's milkweeds
are gone. Farmers using Roundup Ready genetics in soybeans, cotton,
corn and sugar-beets are eradicating milkweed from their field
nationwide, forcing the monarch butterflies to lay their eggs on
milkweed in field borders and ditches. Have we done well? Perhaps
not by the butterflies.

Who is going to tell our children?

Glyphosate (commonly known as Roundup) linked to Non-Hodgkin's
Lymphoma

A population-based case-control study conducted in Sweden between
1987 and 1990 by oncologists Dr. Lennart Hardell and Dr. Mikael
Eriksson concluded that exposure to herbicides and fungicides
resulted in significantly increased risks for non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma (NHL), a form of cancer. In the study, published in the
March 15 Journal of American Cancer Society, the researchers
concluded that in particular, exposure to glyphosate "yielded
increased risks for NHL". Glyphosate is the world's most widely
used herbicide. It is estimated that over 112,000 metric tons were
used worldwide during 1998. Companies developing
herbicide-resistant crops also are increasing their production for
herbicides such as glyphosate and requesting permits for higher
residues of these chemicals in genetically engineered food.
Monsanto, for instance, has received permits for a threefold
increase in herbicide residues--from 6 parts
per million to 20 parts per million on genetically engineered
soybeans in Europe and the United States.

That may be true, but it does not mean that it's not useful to a fine
market - the experts who need media.  It might also be useful to
plenty of people in poorer countries, where every dollar counts more.
This may be a major factor driving Linux in the future -- companies,
ISPs, colleges, and high schools in India and China who will buy one
CD to install on dozens and dozens of PC's, rather than having to pay
hundreds of dollars for each seat.  This can lower the cost of a PC by
as much as 10 - 30 % depending on the cost of the alternative
commercial OS.

It is also definitely true that having to pay only once for support
(which is what you're really buying from Red Hat) is vastly cheaper
for a small company than having to pay for each desk's installation of
the OS.

A small company could buy one CD, copy it to each of, say 10 desks,
and then have one designated tech guy call up and get support for any
problems that anyone in the company experiences.  This is vastly
cheaper than $40 x 10 and an excellent deal for the small company.  

Rather than a good or bad way of doing things, I think of this as a
different market niche.  In my opinion there's no inherent moral
superiority to one or another way of doing things, though I personally
enjoy the freedom that free software gives and therefore enjoy using
it more.

James

----------------------------------------

We have had a request from a contact in the BBC to canvas readers for
opinions on "Ghostwatch" for DVD. This was a one off show from a few years
ago that was broadcast on Halloween and scared the nation witless. Staring
Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith and Craig Charles the play was a
pseudo documentary about a "ghostwatch" at a suburban house in Middlesex
which cut between studio shots of Parkinson and "live shots" from the house.
Although it was well signalled as a drama in the press before hand, many
where taken in by it and believed that it was real, right down to the shock
ending. Stories then circulated in the press for weeks after that the
program was responsible for the "Suicides" of several teenagers after
watching the show. In many wasy this was the BBC's equivalent of the
infamous Orson Welles "War of the Worlds" broadcast.

One of the things that makes this so ripe for a DVD release is that most of
the original material still exists on tape and many of the production team
still lecture to media students on the show. Extra material should be easy
to come by making it a great DVD. Besides, to the best of my knowledge it
has never been re-broadcast and has never been available on VHS before.

If you would like to see this released on DVD then send a message to:

bbcghostwatch@hotmail.com

as soon as possible. I know I'd like to see this done with an excellent set
of extras.

$45 Million Grant Awarded to Buy Supercomputer 

by JOHN MARKOFF
he National Science Foundation announced yesterday that it had made a $45 
million award to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to buy what will be the 
world's fastest nonmilitary supercomputer when it is completely installed 
next year, Compaq, the computer's maker, said. 

The award, which was announced Thursday in Washington after the foundation 
reviewed proposals from five competition scientific centers, is intended to 
reinvigorate the nation's civilian computational science resources, which 
have increasingly fallen behind the resources available to the military in 
recent years. 

"The general perception is that we're under-resourced when compared to the 
military programs," said Robert Borchers, division director of the advanced 
computational infrastructure and research division of the National Science 
Foundation. 

The military has been spending heavily on supercomputing as part of the 
Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative, which is intended to insure the 
nation's nuclear weapons stockpile maintains its effectiveness during the 
nuclear testing treaty that bans weapons testing. 

The announcement is likely to shake up the supercomputer industry. The other 
two major competitors were machines designed by I.B.M. and Intel, who have 
recently been the most powerful forces in the supercomputer industry. Now, 
however, Compaq may emerge as a third force in the competition. 

The foundation's award is also a boost for the Pittsburgh Supercomputer 
Center, which has been in jeopardy since March of 1997 when the foundation 
announced it planned to cut in half the number of supercomputer centers it 
finances -- from four to two. 

The remaining two centers are the National Center for Supercomputer 
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the San 
Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California at San Diego. 

The Pittsburgh supercomputer will be designed and built by Compaq Computer 
Corporation and the new machine will have a peak performance of about six 
trillion mathematical operations per second - or six teraflops - when it is 
completely installed some time in the second half of next year. 

The most powerful military supercomputer is a 12 teraflop supercomputer 
called ASCI White, which is being installed at Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. The machine will cost $110 million, take up 
two basketball courts worth of floor space, weigh 106 tons and will 8.192 
processors. 

The Compaq computer will be based on 2.728 Alpha processors, which will be 
organized into 682 separate nodes and will cost about $36 million. 

The new computer will be shared by different scientific disciplines, 
including materials science and climate modeling. Because the new machine 
will have six times the power of the current fastest nonmilitary computer, 
Mr. Borchers said it was possible that it would be able to do fundamentally 
new science. 

"I suspect in the areas of materials and biological science it will be 
possible to make significant advances," he said.

Well that sentence at least is testable. Is there any data available as to
whom contribute what and where they are employed?

Most of the free software I use is written by somebody employed somewhere
for writing exactly that software. As you yourself are.

I don't believe that free software is a hobbyist project anymore, but would
like to see data to show me wrong.

hehe.... until i open up that sandwich, and note that it has 2 slices of 
bread, mayo
on the top part, mustard on the bottom part, with bologna and a slice of 
cheese. Then i also
note that sometimes you give me an Enhanced Version of the sandwich that 
has lettuce and
tomato on it... Then i start making my own, and put you out of business! 
MUAHAHAHA!! ;)

Yeah... what, you've never heard of Sinfo and Dinfo?  You really should
catch their show sometime, they're freakin' hilarious.  Especially that
little Dinfo... always bumping into stuff... hehehe.... Dinfo....


I -know- all the major complaints are going to come from the technical
angle.  As stated, I really wanted to just engage in the mind experiment: IF
it were possible, would it result in a desirable state of affairs?

But I'll hypothesize nonetheless:

Yeah, well this is the issue-- you can't encrypt the last link in the chain.
Maybe music will always be 'Dinfo.'

Or maybe not.

I'm trying to consider the concept of a fundmentally different type of
information-- this is wildly speculative stuff here, so lets just think
outside the box for a minute:

The sort of information I'm talking about is likely to be extremely complex
and represent full blown human experiences and the like, but let's just deal
with a primitive little sensory experience like music or the movies.
Firstly, the future means of distribution of these experiences may not be
over 'material' substrates like the air of your living room.  But secondly,
with only a little sprinkle of imagination, isn't it possible to envision a
type of experiential information that is protected against analog capture?
My digital video camera, for instance, doesn't like capturing footage off of
a television screen or computer monitor-- the refresh rates don't match.  If
we start with a different set of assumptions and different starting
conditions I think we can imagine a scenario in which your music capturing
equipment knows whether or not its allowed to duplicate my music data.
Think of the empowerment of privacy in a world in which I can send you an
audio message that can't be surreptitiously recorded.  Hell, maybe we'll
have such fine grained control over -reality- that I'll be able to play a
message in a crowded room and only you will hear it.

Okay, so, it's pure speculation.  I'll grant that.  I'm talking about
imaginary technology here folks.

So, I don't need to hear about how it can't be done-- but I would be
interested to hear some intelligent discussion on whether such a thing would
ever be possible.


Cheers.

Wow -- this IS big news: Not only do we have a new planet to play with, but 
apparently our sun has become a binary with Epsilon Eridani.  How could I 
have missed this?

That should read "nearby" solar system...obviously not ours.

(Psst ... a minor detail in light of Epsilon Eridani :-))

What is so wonderful about this star is that we can actually
see it in the sky and also that there may be other planets, closer
than the large Jupiter-like planet, orbiting around it. 

"Because Epsilon Eridani is so bright and one of the 10 nearest
star system it is easily detectable. 'You can go outside at night,
even in Austin, and point at it and say that star there has a
planet around it.'" (Cochran)

Another small correction:  the article states that the McDonald Observatory
is in Austin. Although associated with the University of Texas at Austin,
the actual observatory is in the Davis Mountains (Ft. Davis) in West Texas
where the air is dry & very clear.

E. Shaun was probably just thinking ahead. Maybe we can make an argument that Epsilon Eridani is in our "territorial waters." The astronomers said it was in our "back yard." Only a measly 10.67 light years. And only about a billion years old - maybe nobody has staked it out yet. Of course, if some other nearby planet has bigger ray guns than us, forget about it.

This is an attractive image, and I can understand your desire to see
a world which allows this sort of flexibility and innovation.  It is
necessary to look more closely at the details, though.  Just thinking
of generic "information", smart or dumb, paints the picture with two
broad a brush.

Some kinds of information can reasonably be controlled, and others cannot.
That's the nature of reality.  Any model of the future which rejects this
fact is going to miss its mark.

Music, paintings, videos, and similar recorded works cannot reasonably
be controlled.  They are the same every time, and it is too easy to
record them and digitize them and propagate them.  This is the point
John Gilmore was making, that the RIAA and MPAA and the various other
associations are fighting against nature, rather than with it.

Better targets for control are information services.  If the information
you provide is dynamic, up to date, flexible and adapted to the current
situation, then you can more reasonably expect to "own" the service
of providing that information.

There has been considerable work on models in which agents interact and
trade with one another in a model very much like your "frictionless
matrices of the future".  Agoric computing, developed by Drexler and
Miller, envisions a net full of software agents which sell services to
one another, with full control over whom they choose to interact with
(see http://www.agorics.com/agoricpapers.html).  Take a look at the
abstract from the first paper:

   This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a
   framework-agoric systems-for applying the power of market mechanisms
   to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this
   model at a variety of levels. Initial market strategies are outlined
   which, if used by objects locally, lead to distributed resource
   allocation algorithms that encourage adaptive modification based on
   local knowledge. If used as the basis for large, distributed systems,
   open to the human market, agoric systems can serve as a software
   publishing and distribution marketplace providing strong incentives for
   the development of reusable software components. It is argued that such
   a system should give rise to increasingly intelligent behavior as an
   emergent property of interactions among software entities and people.

This sounds a lot like your picture of intelligent data.  When a
data service is used, the author gets paid.  This creates incentives
for ever more innovation and improvement in information engineering.
Mark Miller's work on the E programming language (www.erights.org) is
designed to facilitate such a world.  Likewise the MojoNation effort
(www.mojonation.net) has concepts which are similar.

The key to these models is that they are careful to distinguish between
what reasonably can be controlled, and what can't.  They don't pretend
that you can give information to someone else and then control what
they do with it.  Nevertheless they seem to suggest that many of the
properties you attribute to smart information will be possible even in
a world where IP is not owned.

actually, i remember this from a cartoon, i'll be damned if i can remember

the owner of some company needed the planes in the air right now of another 
company
to do something for him, so he tells his broker to sell every share of the 
stock of the other
company at 1/3 price, then everyone on the market goes "oh shit, they know 
something we
don't", and dumps all thier shares of it at a loss, and then the guy buys 
up like 60% of the
company, and comes on the radio of the planes, and says "I'm your new boss, 
here's what
i need you to do".

anyway, just my random ramblings of stimuli triggered memorys....

If you want data on who contributed what, pick a project and look at
the ChangeLog. In the context you snipped, I was talking about initial
development. I wouldn't deny that mature free tools contain plenty of
code written under contract, or written by people adapting free tools
on their employer's dime for their employer's purposes. So what?

What software are you using? What do you consider free?

'free software' is a broad category. Some tools are getting enough use
that institutions can develop to support and extend them. Again, so
what? I don't see any evidence of the fundamental shift you imply.

"Buckloads" makes sense with money, to me anyway.  I have always assumed
that "buttloads" was a derivative of "boatloads", meaning massive amounts of
cargo.  Any idea where this word really comes from?

I used to always hear "shitloads" as in the wagon used by a farmer
to haul a load of manure with which to fertilize the fields.  I think
the term buttload is a derivative of shitload.  spike

Ed Case is a neophyte here who has reached out in what I considered a sincere way to Natasha, Max and others in regards to trying to quit bad health habits.  I was one of the people who gave a little advice and wished him well.

I think Ed may have been under the heavy influence of alcohol when he posted this.  I myself try to avoid posting when drunk out of my mind(just kidding)!!  

Or someone may be posting in his name as a stupid prank.  This is also a possibility we must keep in mind.  Things like that have certainly happened before.

I can understand some of Ed's sentiment here.  But in the world we live in I would not feel comfortable having the citizenry disarmed.  A whole planet disarmed would be cool but that is just not a realistic option...

Anyway, perhaps Ed Case will explain things later on.  I look forward to seeing what he will have to say.


sincerely,

As you have correctly surmised, I am not a dolt.  Therefore I would never 
argue (and have never argued) that Napstering copyrighted music is a good 
thing for those who own the copyrights.  So sure, from the *point of view of 
the artist/record company* Napster is a “bad” thing.  No argument there.  
But I try to look at this question from the broadest possible view.  Not 
merely from the standpoint of the copyright holders, nor merely from the 
standpoint of the pirates.  But from the view of trying to determine the 
absolute or “greater good.”

>From this broad viewpoint we first have to decide whether the copyright laws 
as presently drafted foster the greater good.  If yes, then Napster and its 
ilk are clearly a “bad” thing since they serve to circumvent the benevolent 
copyright law.  If, however, the copyright laws cause more harm (in 
diminished free flow of data) than their supposed good (in stuffing the 
pocketbooks of content providers), then Napster is not so clearly a bad 
thing.  Eh?

You’re right.  It’s pretty much a given (even by the RIAA folks) that there 
is no way to stop piracy completely.  Their goal is merely to make piracy so 
difficult/inconvenient as to discourage the majority of lazy slobs who would 
rather schlep down to Wherehouse Records® than figure out how to install and 
run Napster.

Though I found _What Art Is_ by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi
generally agreeable and, where it was not agreeable, thought provoking, the
last chapter leaves a lot to be desired, especially the section dubbed "Art
and the Law."  Here they start out discussing copyright protection and move
on to censorship.  So far, so good.  The bizarre thing is that their stance,
while not openly supporting censorship, lays the groundwork for would be
censors.

As for the coverage itself, Torres and Kamhi appear to slip right into the,
sad to say, typical Objectivist-as-a-conservative mode of thinking.  (This,
unfortunately, shows us that there's a lot of truth to the notion that if
you scratch an Objectivist, underneath you'll find a conservative.)  Instead
of questioning laws against pornography (p296) and other prohibitions of
self-expression such as laws against desecration of the American flag
(pp294-5) -- regardless of whether that expression is art or whether it is
tasteful or whether it follows alleged community standards -- they assume
these laws are valid and show how their otherwise clear and rational view of
art can bolster irrational and oppressive laws.

What is even stranger here is that Rand herself explicitly was against
censorship laws, including those against pornography, for both being vague
and injurious to a free society and individual human life.  (On the
vagueness issue:  What, after all, are community standards?  Why should
experts or a jury get to decide them for all of us?  Certainly, the makers
and would be consumers of censored materials are part of the community.)
Nowhere do they acknowledge her stance on this subject.

Though Torres and Kamhi are quick to call such things -- pornographic photos
and flags stuffed in toilet bowls -- non-art (and rightfully so in these two
cases) that such material is not art is not and should not be the standard
for keeping any government's hands off.  The standard, in fact, should be
one that is well known in the Objectivist movement: Does it violate anyone's
individual rights.  If not, the government has no right to interfere,
regardless of whether the work is art or even tasteful.  If it does, then it
would not matter if it were art, it would still be something subject to
government involvement.

The primary question in this setting then should not be "Is it art?" - a
question governments should keep their hands off - but "Should governments
even be allowed to legislate or adjudicate these issues?"

Though Torres and Kamhi distinguish between "art and other forms of
'expression'" (p294), they do not see that basically the same legal limits
should apply to both.  All human works (and actions) embody values in some
way -- i.e., are forms of expression in some sense -- whether they be art,
bridge building, or making breakfast.  Freedom of expression -- not to be
confused with narrow legal definitions which only acknowledge it in a legal
context -- covers all of these, from creating and experiencing art to
running a business to style of dress (or undress) and the like.  (If only
art is granted full protection, then the government will have a free hand
everywhere outside the gallery, concert hall, library, and cinema.)  They
repeated rely on very narrow, status quo definitions of law, never
questioning whether these laws are right -- except in so far as the laws
agree or disagree with their definitions and theory of art.

On the issue of child pornography (see pp296-7), they ignore that in the
United States, any photograph or depiction of child nudity has time and
again been considered by the courts to be child pornography.  E.g., nudists
who videotape or photograph their families -- with no intention of calling
such stuff art, much less broadcasting it on TV hanging it in a gallery --
are often tried for child pornography.  It's another discussion here of just
what should be done about child pornography, but such a vague legal stance
should not be tolerated.

Torres and Kamhi even go so far to admit elsewhere that standards of quality
are basically subjective. (p467 n35)  With this in mind, might not, say, the
rape scene in _The Fountainhead_ be considered purely pornographic.  Is it
thus a good candidate for banning?  This does not mean the distinction
between pornography and art is blurry, but illustrates that within the
current cultural context, where their remaining silent on these issues might
lead.  Books have been banned in the US and elsewhere for less titillating
passages.

Also, they do not consider that such laws in themselves invite people to
challenge them, thus setting us up for making this into a politically
charged issue.  (One writer, several years ago, even suggested banning the
works of the Founding Fathers, so that these works would be more widely
read.)  This distracts attention away from the matter they should be
concerned with -- i.e., Is it art?

The policeman, the army, and the courts -- to use Rand's trinity -- have no
role in this process -- other than to uphold individual rights.  I hope
Torres and Kamhi see this and that, perhaps, somehow their intentions differ
from what was actually printed in their book.  (Also, the argument that this
is basically an esthetics book will not hold water here.  One would not
write a book on Objectivist metaphysics and conclude with a discussion
supporting socialism, then argue that this is just a book on metaphysics so
it's political conclusions should not be scrutinized.)

For the record, this one section should not damn the whole book, which is a
wonderful and detailed examination of both Rand's esthetics, Modern Art, and
20th century esthetics.  It will, no doubt, be the source of much esthetics
discussion in and (hopefully) out of the Objectivist movement for years to
come.

Hello, Mark,
I see you've met the welcoming committee! Don't abandon all hope just yet.
You see, Matt has recently been selected as your pet hominid during your
transition to posthuman status. As your introductory packet has informed
you, uploading and uplifting have been eliminated from the hominid
progression, due to unforeseen stability and integrity concerns
in the original substrate. Leapfrogging is apparently the only option open
at this point in space-time...unless you want to try that tunneling
thingie that's rather avante-gardish this millennium.

Of course, if you prefer to remain human, we will equip you with all the
latest in LE protocols, financial strategies, legal advisors and an
"Offshore/Off-planet Govt. For Dummies" and "Govt. For Dummies Quick
Reference Guide" at no additional charge. WOMD available at-cost.

So, we've got it all! Whether you think big (M-brains) or small
(nano/gene-gineering) we're well equipped to provide it all. And lest you
think that techno-geek is our only culture, be forewarned about our
musicians and artists who compose with string theory on the cosmic canvas.

Now, exchange your current gods for the gods of rational, critical
and creative thinking. Next, be prepared to improve, optimize,
augment and, finally, extend all aspects of your identity, existence and
reality.  Once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll realize how inevitable
that initial leap...

And in closing:

That would be part of the Jones Binary currently visible in the California
skies. 'Overcoming' gravity has always been an issue
during their watch. They are in charge of transportation.

So. Welcome, and enjoy the ride.

 In the past, whole industries have suffered when technology 
threatened to destroy their market by altering the way society 
worked. Naturally, they opposed this change and attempted to halt 
progress.
 I think most people on this list, however, would acknowledge 
that those changes were good when they happened to the railroad 
industry (just the first thing that came to mind), or anything 
else that stood in the way of progress. The good of society (our 
good) is more important than the good of any particular industry, 
and actually, by opposing progress, the people involved in the 
industry were hurting themselves.
 However, when it comes to intellectual property, apparently it 
strikes a little closer to home, perhaps because more people on 
this list make a living off of the products of their mind than in 
a more average group. It seems to me, though, that the issue is 
the same. It will ultimately come down to a fight between the 
(relatively small number of) artists and record companies who 
want to protect their creations, and the larger populace who want 
to consume them. It seems to me arrogant to assume that our 
industry is so much different than all the ones that came before. 
Certainly, the general public (or at least, the Napster fans) 
don't see any difference.

 As an amature artist (song-writer/guitar player for 3 years) the 
idea of IP seems very attractive (people pay me money every time 
they listen to my song? wow!) But from the broader view, I have 
to say that IP looks like an obstruction to our progress in 
general. I think the micropayment plan would have been a good 
intermediate step between the "current system" and "information 
is free", but since we've already leaped past that option, I 
think record companies and artists now have to deal with reality, 
and accept the death of IP.

Biotech behemoth Monsanto, which has heretofore held the patent to
vitamin-A enriched genetically modified rice, has decided to release the
patent to the scientists of the world.  Vitamin-A is a crucial ingredient
lacking in the diets of many third-world countries.

BNFL has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to its workers for a
range of cancers, including leukemia, on a probability of just 20% that the
cancers were caused by radiation.

If socialists/ 3rd world countries can't be trusted, then they shouldn't be
built! Chernobyl affected quite a few (non-socialist) countries as well
..... there was a ban on consumption even of British lamb directly because
of it for several years.

Are you telling me that there are no stupid jerks/ human incompetents in the
USA (no matter what their politics)?

Yes, am not disagreeing that the world is a dangerous place ..... but I

The greens that you hate are just taking steps on their own behalf against
what they feel is a direct

Obvious point ..... yes, even you seem to accept "stockholders are

But only an *obsolete* argument if wrong ... are you claiming that Monsanto
are acting out of altruism??

I think one danger of GM strains is it will lead to monoculture ... the new
GM seeds might well replace the variety of (less efficient yielding)
strains, and cut down on biodiversity.

>What is your answer to the question, though??? What is permaculture?

From: http://csf.colorado.edu/perma/

Permaculture values and validates traditional knowledge and experience.
Permaculture incorporates sustainable agriculture practices and land
management techniques and strategies from around the world. Permaculture is
a bridge between traditional cultures and emergent earth-tuned cultures.

Permaculture promotes organic agriculture which does not use pesticides to
pollute the environment.

Permaculture aims to maximize symbiotic and synergistic relationships
between site components.

Permaculture is urban planning as well as rural land design.

Permaculture design is site specific, client specific, and culture specific.
?Source: Pilarski, Michael (ed.) 1994. Restoration Forestry. Kivaki Press,
Durango, CO. p. 450.

Due to the inherent sustainability of perennial cropping systems,
permaculture places a heavy emphasis on tree crops. Systems that integrate
annual and perennial crops-such as alley cropping and agroforestry-take
advantage of "the edge effect," increase biological diversity, and offer
other characteristics missing in mono- culture systems. Thus, multicropping
systems that blend woody perennials and annuals hold promise as viable
techniques for large-scale farming. Ecological methods of production for any
specific crop or farming system (e.g., soil building practices, biological
pest control, composting) are central to permaculture as well as to
sustainable agriculture in general.

Hope this helps.

>From the August 4 2000 issue of Science:

"In 1994, Zakian and collaborator Vincent Schulz reported that the protein
Pif1p keeps telomeres from lengthening. It remained unclear, however,
how Pif1p accomplished that feat. There are many natural substances
that could inhibit telomere lengthening in indirect ways, Zakian said.
The new paper shows that Pif1p acts on the telomerase pathway itself
and interacts directly with telomeric DNA, a potentially attractive feature
for drug developers."

Three of the "reasons' are exactly the same ("My family smelled it, heard
it, and I saw it on July 1, 2000 at the Oregon Caves National Monument in
southern Oregon."), and the First reason is:

"The Gallop Poll revealed that most Americans believe in God, yet they have
never seen God.  (What is so difficult about believing in the existence of a
large mountain ape that you can smell, hear, and see?)"

And a quick browse through the site reveals:

Under "Biblical Parallels":

"Disclaimer: These parallels were put together by myself and a pastor friend
of mine.  The Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) is not a Christian
group nor do they endorse these parallels in any manner.  I happen to be a
Christian by faith and I have been brainstorming to make sense out of my
recent encounter with Bigfoot.  Believe me, Bigfoot does exist.  Please
believe me, Jesus does too"

Subject: Monsanto to Provide Royality-Free Licenses for "Golden Rice" Development
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

ST. LOUIS (AP) - Monsanto announced it will give away free licenses to use
its patented technology for so-called "golden rice" and other genetically
engineered rice varieties that advocates say could save millions of Third
World children.

The St. Louis biotechnology company made the announcement Thursday at a
symposium in Chennai, India.

Along with the new licensing plan, Monsanto said Thursday it will release
its rice genomic sequence database on a new Web site, www.rice-research.org.

"We want to minimize the time and expenditure that might be associated with
obtaining licenses needed to bring 'golden rice' to farmers and the people
in dire need of this vitamin in developing countries," Monsanto Chief
Executive Hendrik Vefaillie said.

"Golden rice," which is enriched with vitamin A that could save malnourished
children from blindness or death, was developed by scientists in Switzerland
and Germany. Critics of biotech crops say not enough is known about their
safety or effect on the environment.

Scientists working on improving the rice will now be able to use any of
Monsanto's biotechnology tools free of charge.

The company hopes the licensing plan will spur development of rice varieties
with increased levels of vitamin A, more commonly known as beta carotene.

The modified rice is expected to provide nutritional benefits to those
suffering from vitamin A deficiency-related diseases, including irreversible
blindness found each year in hundreds of thousands of children. Adequate
consumption also can reduce the number of deaths associated with infectious
diseases, such as diarrhea and childhood measles, by improving the immune
system.

Monsanto announced in April it had a draft sequence of a rice genome, the
first crop genome to be described in such detail.

Monsanto is a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Pharmacia.

Rice is a relatively poor source of many essential nutrients, including
vitamin A, but is the staple for half the world. An estimated 124 million
children worldwide are deficient in vitamin A, including a quarter million
in Southeast Asia who go blind each year because of the problem. Improved
nutrition could prevent 1 million to 2 million deaths a year, scientists
say.

Rice naturally produces its own beta carotene, but it is lost in the milling
process. The biotech variety would have the beta carotene right in the
endosperm, the part people eat. The beta carotene gives the golden rice
grains a distinctive yellowish hue.

Ah, you are very slippery my friend... yes, very slippery indeed.     :)

I'm not saying anything intelligent in the post at all, so please feel free
to ignore it.

Hmm, upon reflection, I suppose I should have put that statement at the top
of this reply so you wouldn't have to read the message to realize that you
don't need to read the message.

Although, maybe you're one of those skimmer types, who skips to the end, and
then reads backwards.

Oh, damn, then I've screwed -that- up, because my warning is no longer at
the end.



I -warned- you that there wasn't anything intelligent being said in this
post!


Nope, still nothing, you -really- should do yourself a favor and stop
reading now.

Think of all that other genuinely -important- email piling up in your inbox
at this very moment.  Precious moments of your life are being consumed by
this inane banter.  You could be taking a walk, trying to pick up chicks or
practicing moving things with your mind.



Please have a nice day.

These new species _might_ be fine, or they _might_ be the next thalidamide,
or they _might_ kill all the bees. . . hell, they _might_ turn out to be
_good_ for bees.  Since neither the FDA nor the EPA do _any_ testing of GM
products, we would have no way of knowing.  If this "First to market, and to
hell with the consequences" approach is going to be the model nanotech
development, then we might as well just contact the Galactic Map Authority,
and ask them to mark our planet as unihabitable now.

Yes, their number is 1-555-314-1592-6535-8978-3238-4672....

Seriously, a lot of people argue "for" or "against" this technology.  No
matter which side one is on, I believe that the market will be full of good
products, bad products, dangerous products, safe products, etc.

As have most people (I suppose)...i've gone thru some distinct "phases" in
regard to reading....there for a while i got onto a Western kick and read
every louis lamour book i could find......

But i got over it.

Actually another author...Dan Parkinson.....wrote some very good western
novels.  I haven't been able to find anything new from him in years but the
one's that i did read were historically accurate to my cursorial appraisal
(written about the area of the country that i knew something
about.....texas, oklahoma, kansas etc)...

What got me started on Dan Parkinson was a book called "Calamity Trail" (i
beleive)...

It should come with a warning label.  It is NOT for the weak of heart.

You see....it's hilarious.......i read it...almost died lalughing...i lent
it out to my mother in law...the next day my father in law complained to me
that she had staid up all night reading it....and giggling uncontrolably....

So that got me started on Dan's more serious stuff...some of which was funny
too.

Roger that.  I had a John Steinbeck phase.  Read everything he published.
Hes a flaming commie, but I found his stuff strangely effecting.  Picked
up Grapes of Wrath, just because I was supposed to read it in high school
and didnt, then a couple years outta college finally read it.

His other stuff was very good too, especially East of Eden.  Then I went
into a Jack Kerouac phase.  But there were no hipsters around China Lake
Naval Weapons Center, so I got over that too...  {8^D  spike

Actually, it just occurred to me that I get about as much enjoyment at the 
spa where I work out from watching all the hot female hard bodies in action 
as I do from music - perhaps more.  Perhaps I should be paying them a 
royalty?  They certainly put a lot of work into getting to the point that I 
can enjoy the sight of them, and it was probably done at least partially for 
the purpose of creating that reaction in the right man.

Isn't currency also intellectual property?

Wouldn't a solution be to make the digital data (music etc) difficult to
copy?

It would seem to me that if e-cash is possible...then e-"music" would
similarly be possible using similar techniques...for similar reasons...and
with similar benifit..

I remember a Chinese legend about a very wise judge who had in his court a furious baker who said a poor man in his village would come and stand outside his bakery everyday to enjoy the smell.  And the man did not even recompense the baker for this!!  The judge ordered that the poor man jingle the change in his pockets.  "You have now been paid!," was the response of the judge...

For some reason this post made me think of the hilarious Mojo Nixon video called "Elvislution!"  This is one of my all-time favorites!  Through natural selection and mutation couldn't humanity become more and more Elvis-like overtime? ;)  

Some vaguely remembered lyrics are..

"Evolution is making us more like who each day?"

"ELVIS!!"

"Who's the king of cool?"

"ELVIS!!"

I think this is a theory which should be taught in schools.  At least around Graceland. :)


And what about other theories such as...

Anderslution

MaxMorelution

and even...

Eliezerlution!


best wishes,

John

Dear God:

Please let the "oh, so you just want to protect everything!" arguments stop.

...and also, is it true that Jesus and bigfoot are one and the same?

Oh, and make me seem more right and everyone else seem just a little bit
more wrong, all the time, please.

Thank you.

Oh yeah, and make sure the girls from Phil's spa come and visit me, that
would be a nice touch.

Hello everyone,

This is a very fascinating post from cryonet which was written by prominent cryonicist Paul Wakfer.  In terms of informing us what the current state of cryonics is along with some very interesting past history I would say all should read this.  I greatly respect Paul for his noble Prometheus Project which failed for reasons he gives here.  I am glad my friend is feeling good about life...

There is no site where this is all summarized. The information is very
scattered, and/or not yet written down. This is mainly the result of the constant infighting which goes on in a fringe group like the world of cryonics, for control of the very small pond in which all these frogs are croaking to each other.

This was only an interim step during the research which Greg Fahy was
doing to reversibly cryopreserve kidneys. In fact, not only was it
always deemed impractical for whole body humans, but he very soon found that the pressure itself induced additional unrecoverable damage, and soon after abandoned the pressure approach.

No. All those ideas have been superseded now. 21st Century Medicine (21CM) has developed ice blockers and new cryoprotectants which enable vitrification at high enough cryoprotectant (CPA) concentrations that recrystallization during thawing should be
avoidable at the rate of warming which can be reasonably achieved.

All of this has been hastened by the development by Critical Care
Research (CCR - a split-off of the original 21CM) of perfluorocarbon
perfusion methods which allow very rapid cooling and warming of whole
bodies even, right down to the vitrification holding temperatures
required.

Basically, things are looking exceedingly optimistic that perfected
whole body suspended animation could be "just around the corner", if we could only get these short-sighted, head-in-the-sand, money-hoarding cryonicists to fork over the necessary cash. I hasten to add that my comments do not apply to those few wonderful, courageous, and fully rational people who have monetarily supported all the research to achieve these goals, and, of course, to the researchers themselves.
As it is, the work of proving out, completing development, and
perfecting the breakthroughs outlined above is ongoing, albeit at a very slow pace.

Even embryos, sperm, and some other things were only viable because they could incur large cell loss and still recover (lots of individual sperm, and multiple totipotent cells in an early stage embryo - the only kind which worked). The CPA's and methods used do not produce high levels of individual cell viability. The 21CM developments should be marketable for these purposes so that far higher viabilities can be obtained.

whole body suspended animation could be "just around the corner", if we 
could only get these short-sighted, head-in-the-sand, money-hoarding 
cryonicists to fork over the necessary cash. I hasten to add that my 
comments do not apply to those few wonderful, courageous, and fully rational 
people who have monetarily supported all the research to achieve these 
goals, and, of course, to the researchers themselves.
As it is, the work of proving out, completing development, and
perfecting the breakthroughs outlined above is ongoing, albeit at a very 
slow pace.

>Overall, everything from embryos to aortas could be frozen and thawed
>successfully, but nothing bigger.

Even embryos, sperm, and some other things were only viable because they 
could incur large cell loss and still recover (lots of individual sperm, and 
multiple totipotent cells in an early stage embryo - the only kind which 
worked). The CPA's and methods used do not produce high levels of individual 
cell viability. The 21CM developments should be marketable for these 
purposes so that far higher viabilities can be obtained.

>21CM thought they had money and capability
>to succeed with kidneys and that would give them money enough to go on to
>whole bodies in ten years or so.

Here you are slightly mixing up 21CM and PP. 21CM began to concentrate
on kidneys because that was the specialty and ongoing project of Greg
Fahy who had just joined them. However, I admit that your mixup is very 
reasonable since the pronouncements and policies of 21CM on the subject of 
suspended animation research changed back and forth so many times that even 
I, a relative insider, could not keep track of them.

>Now I gather that 21CM has  found improved vitrification fluids that by
>themselves leave brain slices ~95 percent functional (not after
>freeze-and-thaw, just after exposure to the fluid.)

No. This has not been demonstrated yet, partly because 21CM is not
working with brain slices. That it the research project of the Institute for 
Neurocryobiology's Hippocampal Slice Cryopreservation Project (HSCP) in full 
cooperation with 21CM, of course. What you have read about 95% is that 
*rabbit kidney* slices have been loaded and unloaded (immersed to 
equilibration and then fully washed-out), with 95% recovery in comparison to 
controls simply kept in a nutrient solution.

In addition, this "viability" is not assessed in terms of "functionality" 
since that cannot be done for kidney slice, which are no longer "functional" 
by definition. Instead the viability is only "cellular" viability as 
determined by the intracellular sodium/potassium ratio, which can only be 
kept stable by a cell whose mitochondrial energy cycle is completely 
operational. While this is a good measure of cellular viability it does not 
measure all cellular function nor does it measure intercellular 
functionality which is crucial for brain tissue.

INC is now trying to garner the funds to proceed to show that the
improved CPA also give higher (than the 52% we currently have) cellular 
viability for rat hippocampal slices even after vitrification and thawing.

Once that is complete, INC hopes to get back the original project of
obtaining propagation of evokes potentials across a brain slice as
outlined in the research proposal at http://neurocryo.org Of course,
this will require still more money, but if successful will give a very
meaningful and realistic demonstration that these vitrified/rewarmed
hippocampal slices have truly been through perfected suspended
animation. Whole brains will then be the next step, and thereafter whole 
bodies!

>And nobody else seems to be making progress.

Nobody else is even trying!! Half of them are busy counting the number
of identities on the head of a pin, and the other half are waiting for
the Nanotechnology God to save their asses while get on with life as
usual.

>Also, Prometheus had received some money but afterwards the site never 
>seemed
>to be updated. [Did it get more or what?]

PP was pure pledge campaign to attempt to garner sufficient support to
perfect suspended animation. It was never intended to collect any money 
until it has sufficient pledges to do the project, and it never received a 
cent. I personally received a few hundred dollars of support from Roy Yowell 
and additional support in man-hours, particularly from Leonard Zubkoff, both 
of whom I wish to thank again. It is noteworthy that these same two 
individuals and many other PP pledgers also donated the funds which allowed 
the HSCP to get to where it is today. In addition, there were a few people 
who were not PP pledgers who also donated money to support the HSCP.

The plan for PP was to get sufficient pledges, without requiring any up 
front cash,
1) to shock people into believing that the project could actually be
realized,
2) to pressure the cryonics organizations (who are all jealously
guarding their own "territory") to realize that in their own best
interest they had better jump on the bandwagon, and
3) to garner enough credibility, in terms of potential monetary support and 
the establishment "legitimacy" which comes with it, that the scientists 
whose support and participation was needed would write a full proposal so 
that the rest of the pledged funding could be obtained.

The first of those three succeeded better than anyone (including me)
imagined that it would.

The second of these failed miserably, either because of my lack of tact and 
ass-kissing ability, or because of the intransigent, pig-headedness and/or 
power lust of the major cryonics leaders (of Alcor and CI), or perhaps 
because they don't really want to live in a world where some upstart can 
succeed where they could not. All the reasons for rejecting support for PP 
were totally specious, but these leaders were and still are masters of the 
art of political rationalization, casting doubt, and making false arguments 
just logical enough that they are believable to naive, trusting souls. I 
could not counter such tactics and do not want ever to be able to do so.

The third of these also failed miserably because I, being a naive,
trusting soul, did not make a written contractual understanding about
what the results of certain of my actions would be. Thus, I brought the 
necessary leverage (PP and a pilot project proposal and available
funding which became the HSCP) to bear to cause *the* crucial scientist to 
enter the cryonics research fold expecting that he would then write the full 
PP science plan which was necessary to revive the pledge campaign.

However, the die was cast and I came up the loser. The scientist became 
contractually obligated to those whom I had conspired with, was not to be 
available to write the PP plan, and would also not be available to oversee 
the project as principal investigator. In addition, the company employing 
that scientist took all the wind from the PP sails by placing itself in 
direct competition, even with a head start, so that it now appeared clear to 
most of the previous and potential new pledgers that they could once more 
feel at east to sit on their asses and spend their hard earned income on 
immediate gratification or personal wealth building.

Of course, I am sure others will have a different "story" on all these
things. You will have to judge for yourself by judging what is essential and 
what is inessential in all these viewpoints.

Finally, the PP website has not been updated, because there has really
been nothing positive to say, and while I had little heart to do
anything, I still thought there might be some value in keeping it there (all 
at my expense, of course), if for no other reason, as a monument to "what 
might have been and should have been".

>Can anyone correct and update the summary?  Is there a single site where I
>can track the status and progress of the problems?

I have tried my best to do the first. If you have any questions, I will try 
to answer them. As for the second it is not likely to happen while cryonics 
retains the fragmented, cultist, inbred, ingrown and navel gazing state that 
it now
has.

On a personal note, I am not nearly as bitter as it may appear from the 
above remarks. I am now leading an ecstatically happy and complete life, 
pursuing life-extension by actually staying animated for an unbounded length 
of time, and joined as tightly and solidly as two interlocked fractals with 
someone with whom I am totally compatible.

If I become terminal in the near-term, I plan to toady-up to the whatever 
bastard is leading the most scientific cryonics organization at the time and 
do the best that I can to save my life by getting cryonically preserved.  If 
I become terminal in the far-term, I expect that perfected suspended 
animation will be available at a nearby major medical center and that all 
the current cryonics organization will either be out of business or as 
insignificant relative to the rest of the world as they are today.  Of 
course as stated above, my highest priority is never to become
terminal at all.

Again my thanks for you questions, it was refreshing to see someone on
this list who is interested in reality rather than "dreamality."

Many years ago I spent some time doing dinner theatre (ugh.)  I did a show

[Non-member submission]

From: Roland Baddeley <rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk>
Three year postdoctoral position funded by the BBSRC to work on the
computational analysis of visual signalling in cuttlefish, to work in
collaboration with Dr Daniel Osorio and Dr Roland Baddeley at Sussex
University.

Cuttlefish have a remarkable ability to change their skin coloration
patterns giving them amazing camouflage abilities, and a very
effective visual communication channel. Previous work on cuttlefish
has relied on qualitative classification of their body patterns, but
by using digital video cameras, image warping techniques, and
statistical pattern analysis, it is now possible to quantitatively
analyze these changing skin patterns. Doing this we hope to understand
their role in camouflage and communication. We are therefore looking
for a postdoctoral researcher (for up to 3 years) who will:

1. Analyze the skin patterns generated by the cuttlefish. We have
developed warping and independent components analysis software. The
researcher would be expected implement additional means of analysis
that would shed light on the dimensionality, any clustering of the
patterns (expected), and implement methods to study the dynamics of
the change.

2. Conduct experiments on camouflage. The animals are kept in tanks
where ``textures'' can be inserted underneath. We can therefore
analyze camouflage by quantifying how the cuttlefish maps the texture
pattern inserted, onto its skin patterns. This will give unprecedented
insight into texture and form perception by a non-human animal. As
well as conducting the experiments, the researcher would be expected
to maintain the animals. No previous experience is required as
training will be provided.

3. Conduct experiments on communication. The cuttlefish communicate by
generating stereotypical patterns on the skin. As well as analyzing
these patterns on their own, given a quantitative description, the
relationship between the patterns of two communicating animals can be
analyzed (information capacity, relationship to behavior). Again the
researcher would be expected to collect data and analyze the results.
Applicants should have a strong background in statistical/neural
network techniques and an interest in applying them to real world
problems. The candidates will be experience in programming (MATLAB
preferred) and mathematical analysis.

Enquiries are welcome and can be made to Daniel Osorio
<d.osorio@sussex.ac.uk> or Roland Baddeley <rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk>
The salary will be on the standard BBSRC scale starting from 19,428
p.a. plus benefits.

Applicants for this position should submit C.V., relevant reprints,
and 3 letters of references. Letters of recommendation can be sent
electronically (plain text, word, or PDF) to rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk
Applications can also be sent by mail to: Roland Baddeley, Laboratory
of Experimental Psychology, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton
England BN1 8QG. Replies will only be made to people who get called
for interview. Closing date 30th October 2000.

"Steve" <steve@multisell.com> replied to Mike Lorrey about the safety
issues re nuclear power:

BNFL has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to its workers for a
range of cancers, including leukemia, on a probability of just 20% that the
cancers were caused by radiation.

>TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
>overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid
'test' 

As a reality check I suggest looking at the article found at:

http://www.ornl.gov/ORNLReview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html

entitled:

Coal consumption: Nuclear Resource or Danger? 

A few short excerpts:

...releases from coal combustion contain naturally occurring radioactive
materials--mainly, uranium and thorium.

Former ORNL researchers J. P. McBride, R. E. Moore, J. P. Witherspoon, and
R. E. Blanco made this point in their article "Radiological Impact of
Airborne Effluents of Coal and Nuclear Plants" in the December 8, 1978,
issue of Science magazine. They concluded that Americans living near
coal-fired power plants are exposed to higher radiation doses than those
living near nuclear power plants that meet government regulations.

Since the 1960s particulate precipitators have been used by U.S. coal-fired
power plants to retain significant amounts of fly ash rather than letting
it escape to the atmosphere. When functioning properly, these precipitators
are approximately 99.5% efficient.

[Which is to say that 0.5% is released into the environment, though such
highly efficient particulate separators are--and I'm guessing on this
one--not nearly so common worldwide as they are in the US and Western
Europe.]]

As population increases worldwide, coal combustion continues to be the
dominant fuel source for electricity.

[From the charts in the article, world coal consumption for 1980 was 3000
million metric tons, projeted for 2000, 4000 million metric tons, and the
combined releases of Uranium and Thorium: 7600 mtric tons in 1980 and
12,500 metric tons projected for 2000.]

The main sources of radiation released from coal combustion include not
only uranium and thorium but also daughter products produced by the decay
of these isotopes, such as radium, radon, polonium, bismuth, and lead.
Although not a decay product, naturally occurring radioactive potassium-40
is also a significant contributor.

(end of excerpt)

To summarize, the global contamination caused by the release of
radioactivity associated with coal combustion power generation is so vastly
greater than the release from nuclear power generation that, rightly
viewed, nuclear power, beyond its central purpose as a power source, is a
profoundly effective means of PREVENTING global environmental radioactive
contamination.

Which, of course, techies have known for years.

			Best, Jeff Davis

It IS a fun way to spend 3 years...

You have to see cuttlefish communicate via pattern changeing to believe it!

Something grand is going on here. Something extremely unique and possible of
great value to future technologies...

"Good" and "harm" (like beauty) are in the mind of the beholder.  If you're 
Blink 182, then kids not being able to get your tunes for free is a "good" 
thing.  If however, you're a pirate living in a U.S.C. dorm and the 
administration has cut off all access to Napster, that (to you) would be 
"bad" thing.

*Everybody* feels entitled to some reward for their efforts.  Society, 
however, sometimes feels otherwise.  I'd like to get paid for riding my bike 
in the mountains, but can't find anyone to pay me for it.  So I do that just 
for fun and I have found other things to do for money.

If Blink 182 finds that suddenly they can't make money from their music, 
they can similarly find other, less fun, things to do for money.  If society 
wakes up to find that Blink 182's retirement from music-making is such a 
terrible thing, people will become willing to pay them again for their 
music.

Thanks for the warning :)

But, I'd be interested in hearing your (serious) thoughts about the points I 
have made when you get around to feeling like it.  We are, after all, 
talking about changing the world, no?

Peace.

Who ever said they deserved a free lunch? A better question: what amount
of milkweed is usually found in natural prairie? Much as a second growth
forest is much different from an old growth forest, a natural original
prairie is far different from a field left fallow for a few years.
Milkweed is not typically that prevalent in natural unirrigated prairie,
so consequently the natural population density of monarch butterflies
should actually be lower than the level at which we 'subsidize' their
current population, so reducing the available food supply for them
should only bring them back to their more natural population levels...

Moreover, although some people have wondered whether corn pollen caught
by the milkweed strands is eaten by the butterfly caterpillars, but no
mention is made of any facts about whether the pesticide is actually
present in the pollen, since the crops are not sprayed during pollen
season, but earlier.

I notice that there was no mention by the writer about what levels of
exposure the Swedish oncologists found to be contributory toward
increased NHL. There had to be some level of exposure they determined
was bad, but I imagine that the bad exposure level is probably at the
very least several times, if not hundreds of times, higer than the 6-20
ppm level Monsanto is talking about, but if they actually admitted that,
the greens would have to admit that its not actually a threat to human
health.... See, thats the sort of way that these greens twist facts in
lies.

What I find interesting is that he has admitted to a federal felony
violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934, then gone on to say that
everyone should be banned from doing the same, when its obviously rather
impossible to enforce (because, right now, DUH, everyone IS banned from
doing what he did). Since he is an admitted felon, and convicted felons
are the only segment of the population that has a majority in favor of
banning gun ownership by civilians (for obvious reasons), I think this
reflects pretty well on what sort of person he really is.

Yeah, from: "I'm so rich that I just squatted and crapped out a buttload
of money."

The exchange rate for a 'buttload' of money is essentially 1 buttload =
1 pile

However, I suppose you could also say "bucketloads" if you desire to be
less crass... ;)

I don't know. He (bigfoot) never seems to be wearing Birkenstocks in the

The AEC does not allow the sort of 'tests' that caused Chernobyl, nor
did the communists have the sort of computer ability we have to simulate
all possible situations. Additionally, their plant construction, a
graphite core, gas cooled reactor, is far more dangerous than our light
water reactor designs. We don't allow graphite core designs in the west.
One of the reasons we were so adamant about the North Koreans giving up
their own nuclear program and buying light water reactors from us is
because they are just as, if not more, screwed up than the USSR was, and
if their plants failed, the fallout would fall on Japan, the US, and
Canada.

Could have fooled me. Their idea of a safety blanket, though, is to

The news speaks for me. Since they just released the rights to vitamin A

they?

Our agricultur is ALREADY a monoculture. What GM technology will
actually do is create a multiculture, because if Monsanto has the patent
on genome A to enrich rice with vitamin A, then Genex has to figure out
another way to accomplish the same thing with a different genome map, so
the free market will encourage diversity of varieties between companies
that produce them, so the concerns of 'monoculture' are not valid.

Since many plants produce their own pesticides (broccoli, etc..) I fear
that this irrational obsession about pesticide will result in plant
species being made extinct because they produce their own pesticides
naturally. Not a very tolerant point of view. Did you know that broccoli
causes cancer?

So they beleive in crop rotation, just like any farmer does (even
corporate farmers). They just try to say it in that blathering

manager, or a Dilbert cartoon.

Thanks, Jeff. This is something I've mentioned several times on the
list. Beyond this, the fly ash that scrubbers collect at coal plants is
resold (carrying EXTREMELY high levels of heavy metals and radioactive
isotopes, so high that if there were not a law protecting it, it would
HAVE to be classified as nuclear waste) and used as filler in concrete
mix, garden loam, and is used as fill material in landfills.

DOUBT CAST ON LIFE ON MARS: UNIVERSITY OF GREENWICH
REPRODUCES CHEMICAL STRUCTURES FOUND IN METEORITES

The complex chemical structures found in a meteorite from Mars, which
scientists in 1996 hailed as possible evidence of past life on the
planet, can be reproduced quite simply in any laboratory according to
new research from the University of Greenwich. Professor Aron Vecht and
researcher Terry Ireland from the university's School of Chemical & Life
Sciences say that the special structures - which are shaped like flowers
and spheres - could have been formed on the cold surface of Mars from
minerals commonly occurring there. Their findings cast grave doubts on
the possibility of Martian life.

SCIENTISTS STRENGTHEN PROSPECTS FOR LIFE ON MARS
New Information Supports Claim Viking Discovered Life in 1976

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

SAN DIEGO, CA., August 1, 2000. -- On the heels of NASA's decision
to land new rovers on Mars, the debate over the existence of life
on the red planet is heating up. Dr. Gilbert V. Levin, a chief
proponent, today advanced his claim to finding living microorganisms
on the elusive planet 25 years ago. Dr. Levin, one of a trio of
scientists, including himself and another who participated in NASA's
Viking Mission, was presenting a paper at the Annual Meeting of the
International Society for Optical Engineering refuting the mainstay
arguments against life on Mars. He contends that those arguments-the
presumed absence of organic matter and of liquid water-are no longer tenable.

One minute the Waco gunshot issue seemed resolved, the next...

   The following webpage contains compelling evidence
   of gunfire either at or from Mt Carmel during the
   April 19, 1993 fire, which I've just discovered on
   a tape known as the "FBI SWAT-team videotape." I've
   provided a sound file so that you can hear and judge
   this evidence for yourself. This tape was recorded
   from sniper nest Sierra-3, about 100 yards from Mt
   Carmel. First you'll hear the apparent crack of
   a gunshot followed by one or two people that
   say "GOOD SHOT" then "GOOD SHOT" again:

   http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm
   http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav

   After that you hear a voice that comes in over a
   police-type radio at the sniper's nest that says:
   "We have rounds cooking off or shots being fired."
   That speaker is apparently at another location.
   Please download and save that sound file. There
   is a lot of background noise, so listen closely,
   and you'll want to listen to it several times.
   I often experience distortions on first runs
   of this clip while hearing it via my browser,
   so be sure to listen to it more than once.

   A Brief Overview of The Evidence Presented Above

   Perhaps the most dedicated Waco researcher I've ever
   known was Richard Sanford, a retired nuclear physicist
   and fellow founding member of the Committee for Waco
   Justice (CWJ). [*] It was a great loss to us all when
   Richard died of a sudden heart attack last week, on
   July 25th. Richard's fiancee donated to the CWJ all
   of Richard's Waco files including the FBI SWAT-team
   video examined at the webpage above, which Richard
   acquired a few years ago from attorney Linda Thompson,
   who acquired it from the government in a FOIA release.

   The FBI SWAT-team video was made by an agent who brought
   his own camcorder to the Waco scene and from sniper nest
   Sierra-3 he taped the Mount Carmel Center as it burned.
   As I viewed the full tape a few days ago for the first
   time, while the fire is seen burning I heard what sounds
   like the sharp crack of a gunshot followed by one or two
   people that say "good shot" and then "good shot" again,
   the second time even louder and clearer than the first.
   Wow! Here we have a tape from a known sniper nest and
   in the background we hear what clearly appears to be
   a gunshot followed by people saying "Good shot." The
   easiest explanation is also the most disturbing.
   A range of possible explanations are explored:

   http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm

   There are other apparent gunshots heard a few moments
   after the shot discussed above, and those shots were
   presented in Linda Thompson's video "Waco II: The Big
   Lie Continues," and they can be heard at this website:

http://geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1543/f_agents/shooter.htm

   About those gunshots, Linda Thompson says: "Listen to
   the FBI SWAT-team tape as the fire burns. Shots can be
   heard from nearby and echoing off the house. That means
   shots were being fired at the house, not from the house."

But now consider the possibility of an "overlaid" (also referred to as 
"augmented," but I prefer the value-neutral more-descriptive term) reality, 
in which what you see may very well depend upon whether you agree to the 
conditions.  I.e., the hard-bodies may well be disguised by a black (virtual 
or real) cloak.  You only get to see them as they want you to, whether you 
happen to meet their criteria for possible mate/lover or whether you're 
willing to ante up.

The VR SIG of the IICS of L.A. once had a session on "teledildonics."  
Suppose sex or intimate interaction at a distance becomes fashionable?  In 
the late '70's or early '80's, there was this crotch-mounted subwoofer that 
briefly became the rage among the adolescent set, so this may not be 
far-fetched at all.  All you need is a remote control and a feedback loop.  
Remember the guy in "Brainstorm" who looped the orgasm mind-tape and played 
it all day?

One of the more interesting developments in recent years is the
TV commercials aimed at getting the general proletariat to pump
their money into the stock market.  The ad campaign has been
most clever.  The one that comes to mind is the ER scene, where
intense emergency personel wheel a man in on a gurney.  The
somber ER doc looks under the the sheet and pulls out a 100
dollar bill:  "This man has money coming out the wazoo.  Get
him to a private room."  {8^D  spike

In the August "Nature Medicine" is an article by Gary J Nabel, it demonstrates
that the extraordinary lethality of the Ebola virus is caused by a certain
glycoprotein produced by the virus. The really interesting thing is the way
he did it, he removed the Ebola gene for this glycoprotein and used genetic
engineering to insert it into the virus that causes the common cold. Intact
human blood vessels were then exposed to this modified cold virus. Within
48 hours this former virus milquetoast caused the human tissue to turn into
stinky gunkey sludge just like mighty Ebola itself.

I haven't heard any protests from the anti genetics people, I guess they're too
busy protecting the world from killer tomatoes, but I got to tell you this scares
the hell out of me. I'm sure they took elaborate precautions to prevent this thing from
getting out,  but holly shit! Imagine a virus that's airborn and as contagious as the
common cold, that has no vaccine or any other treatment, and kills 90% of those
infected in less than 48 hours in a manner gruesome enough for any horror movie.
I sure hope there is something about this experiment I don't understand.

The addition of such wild genes to a sneaky virus like the cold virus is
indeed a frightening thought. Especially as it costs a lot less to research
& implement than refining fissile material then designing &  building an A
bomb.

Such viri are de facto nanotech war machines - and any impoverished despot
can avail himself of such technology.

Expect this in any future war. It's "better" than a neutron bomb.

OUtside of the fact that he violated a number of international laws against
research into biological weapons? I'm surprised nobody has charged him with
crimes against humanity yet. I would not be surprised if this guy doesn't take a
long, secret, sabbatical someplace where there are nice BIG locks on the doors,
and guys in black uniforms with nice big guns guarding the place. I sure as hell
hope he did not publish his technique or identify the gene responsible.

We should be ok as long as this technology doesn't fall into the hands of any
rogue
terrorist organizations, such as the governments of the US, FSU or PRC.

I think the problem with this specific scenario is that the modified
cold virus would kill the host before becoming infective enough to spread
itself widely.  Colds make people emit a lot of mucus, sneeze and cough
to spread themselves, but it takes a while for this to happen.

Bacteria used in experiments such as this are often pretty crippled
strains, lacking the ability to manufacture one or more essential
nutrients not found in nature, but provided in culture.  I don't know what
is done with viruses, but I imagine something similar.

*However*, I see no reason why someone up to no good couldn't repeat this
experiment with a wild virus and make something *very* nasty, other than
the high probabilty he would kill himself before he kills a whole lot of
other people.  

There are rumors that then Soviet scientists did pretty much the above not
with a cold virus, but with weaponized smallpox.  I had discounted this as
pretty unlikely, but now I'm not so sure...

We as a civilization are using centralized, hierarchical tools (laws, threat
of military force) to fight decentralized, distributed threats. The question
is, how can the system be rigged such that anybody working in their basement
can also help *prevent* biowarfare? A couple of possibilities immediately 
spring to mind--

* Hacking/intelligence gathering

* Whistle-blowing

* Working on antidotes/vaccines

* A few well-heeled individuals getting together and coming up with a
  scheme to anonymously off a monetary bounty for the overthrow of any
  leader who can be proven to be pursuing biological weapons. Possibly 
  a tactic that can be used to enforce politeness on the part of the 
  world's governments in many different areas, come to think of it.
  Grudge match-- capitalism vs. tyrrany.

* Monkeywrenching, though this would be a much tougher job than PETA has--
  unlike corporations bent on unleashing pest-resistant tomatoes, anybody
  bastard enough to be bent on unleashing flu-bola is likely to have no
  problem killing as many birkenstock-wearing protestors as it takes. Also,
  care would need to be taken from turning this into a runaway reaction 
  against all cell/molecular bio research, which would be a cure worse
  than the disease.

* Perhaps therein lies the real solution-- pit PETA/ELF/EarthFirst! against 
  the Husseins and Khaddafi's of the world. Two wrongs might not make a
  right, but they just might cancel each other out.

The symptoms of Ebola are massive systemic hemorrhaging in all the tissues
of the body including the lungs. Infected blood pours out of every body orifice,
even from the eyes and ears and around the fingernails. However to get Ebola you'd
have to actually touch the blood, but if the virus were airborn like the common cold ....

That is a question of mechanics. Does the hemmorhaging flood the lungs too much
to allow the victim to have any breath to cough and sneeze?? Since its the big
sneeze that really propells the virus out, at up to 100 mph, you would need to
have a diaphragm musculature that is still intact and able to provide that sort
of force. If the virus is flooded by blood, and the diaphragm muscle is weakened
from undergoing the process of being turned to jelly, then you likely would not
see much spread via atmosphere, although contact transmission would likely be
highly effective, considering the amount of time the cold requires for
incubation, a carrier with the virus 'in hand' could be spreading the virus to
any phone, table, counter, desk, bed, or other surface they come in contact
with. You'd likely have some cases of infected families being torched in their
homes by neighbors, but I doubt this virus would be as communicable by the air
as the cold is.

I suspect that had this research been published a few months ago, it would have been listed
by Bill Joy in his comments about "future pestilence" made at Stanford.  There is a
corollary of the Law of Large Numbers called the "Some Nut Theory" which state that "In a
sufficiently large population, no matter what it is, there is some nut out there who will
try it."  Unfortunately, this implies that when the technological cost of whacking your
first megaperson gets down to $1.50 and two box tops, a fair number of us are going to get
whacked.

CYMM says:
The addition of such wild genes to a sneaky virus like 
the cold virus is
indeed a frightening thought. ...
Such viri are de facto nanotech war machines - and any 
impoverished despot can avail himself of such technology.

Well, I thought this was rather ingenious. And of 
course, on the GM front, there is the vaccine "being put 
into tomatoes" to stimulate the mucosal immune system 
against a different glycoprotein attack. Also, GM of the 
mosquito to elimiate this malarial vector without 
eliminating the mosquito. Or the GM factory in the 
tobacco plant chloroplasts, which effectively addresses 
the issue of cross-pollination. 

Do you not wonder what "good" genes could be added to 
the cold virus and the beneficial aspects of this 
achievement?

I am seeking a good source (v. preferably online) of basic material
specifications, to assess feasibility of a particularly demanding task.

Or, to put it more directly, what is the biggest number currently
available for (density) / (tensile breaking stress)?

Any help greatly appreciated.

Our individual power is increasingly at a rapid rate.  As already noted, it
won't be long before it is trivial for any one individual to get a hold of
the tools necessary to do lots of damage to lots and lots of other people.

I've thought about possible solutions, but they all point in relatively
undesirable directions.

For instance, the only way I can imagine preventing certain types of
mega-nano-crimes is to predict the intention.  But I don't really like the
possible implications of this sort of mental 'eavesdropping.'

For those of you who've read 'The Diamond Age,' by Neal Stephenson you'll be
familiar with the 'nano y nano' scenario.  Unfortunately it doesn't appear
possible to create perfect 'anti-bodies' and it has always been easier to
destroy something than to prevent against destruction.  It lies in the hands
of the defender to predict against all possible attacker vectors, now and in
the future, and I don't see how that will ever be possible.

Again, I believe the step towards increased security lies in 'getting ahead'
of the act and intercepting the intention.  Since the advantage lies in the
hands of the attacker, it should necessarily follow that when your brain is
wired to the network, the tools to hack it will always be one step ahead of
the tools to shield it.  (Barring unbreakable encryption-- of which I am an
advocate.)

I think some variant on the 'active defense' is going to be necessary in any
case.



Thoughts?

I need more sleep, that should of course be the *smallest* available.

Actually, I support the development of GM.  My issue is with testing and
deployment.  I think that GM testing and deployment policy is the test run
for nanotech.  If we don't destroy ourselves, the future's gonna be great!

One possible solution is being pursued directly by SIAI- jump past the
nanotech stage directly to superhuman intelligence. Vote with your donation
dollars, but I feel this is a better approach than trying to develop what
will likely be ineffective means of nanotech/biowar defense. Actually I
donate to both Foresight and SIAI... hedging my bets I guess.

John, since we have heard your views regarding international security,
what do you suggest we do about these ebola-in-the-cold-virus types
of threats?  Even *I* have to admit this is looking more scary than a
nuclear attack.  spike

 P.O. Box 81226

 Subject:  Application for Renewel of amazon.com domain name 

 Dear Mr. Bezos: 

 We recently received your application for renewal of the  "amazon.com"
 domain name for your company, Amazon.com, inc.  Unfortunately, we must
 reject your application, and assign you an alternate domain name
 instead; for the reasons outlined below.

 As you are no doubt aware, the .com top-level domain is  intended for
 use by for-profit corporations.  Many such corporations are registered
 with Network Solutions, and this policy is unchanged.

 However, it has come to our attention, as evidenced by recent SEC
 filings on behalf of Amazon.com, inc., that your company has yet to
 turn a profit.  As such, Amazon.com, inc. no longer qualifies for a
 domain name in the ".com"  hierarchy.  However, based on your
 financial performance, you do qualify for membership in the ".org"
 domain; which is intended for non-profit organizations.  Unless there
 are any objections from you or your representative, Network Solutions
 will assign Amazon.com, inc. the new domain name "amazon.com.org". (We
 would have assigned the shorter "amazon.org" domain, but that domain
 is currently assigned to a website for the San Fransisco lesbian
 community.)

 To be frank; we were gravely concerned about the amount of money that
 amazon.com, inc. has been losing.  We were seriously considering
 assigning a name in the ".gov" domain based on the current rate that
 your corporation is losing money.  However, as Amazon.com, inc. is a
 publicly-traded corporation, and policy reserves the .gov domain for
 organizations that are in fact governmental agencies, it was
 felt that this would not be appropriate.

 This change in your domain name registration only affects your
 Internet domain name as assigned by Network Solutions; and no way
 impairs your right to  continue to do business under the trademark of
 "Amazon.com".  If and when Amazon.com, inc. becomes a profitable
 enterprise; we will  be happy to reconsider granting you once again
 the domain name "amazon.com", assuming it is still available.

 This change shall take effect within the next thirty (30) days, at
 which point the "amazon.com" name will be decomissioned.  You have
 until then to notify customers and business partners.  Effective
 immediately, and for the length of the thirty-day transition period;
 both names wlll be registered to Amazon.com, inc.

 If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact our
 customer service department.
   
 Sincerely, 

 Jim Rutt 
 Chief Executive Officer 
 Network Solutions, Inc.

Original Story at:  http://bbspot.com/News/2000/8/net_domains.html

Geneva - U.N. arbitrators today decided in favor of Microsoft in
    a ruling against companies "cybersquatting" on .net domain
    names.  The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
    ruling means that all internet addresses ending in .net will now be
    transferred to Microsoft.

                  Microsoft announced its .NET strategy last
                  month and says it "will provide easier, more
                  personalized and more productive Internet
                  experiences by harnessing constellations of
    smart devices and Web sites with advanced software through
    Internet protocols and formats."  As part of its .NET strategy
    Microsoft also petitioned the WIPO for control of all .net domain
    names.

    "It's a great victory for Microsoft," said CEO Steve Ballmer,
    "These companies are trying to capitalize on the .net strategy that
    Microsoft created.  They are using our marketing dollars for their
    own gain.  This is America and that sort of thing isn't supposed to
    happen.  We commend WIPO on the decision they made and feel
    that this is in the best interest of the consumer."

    The ruling will take effect immediately.  Microsoft has announced
    that from now on all .net addresses will be redirected to
    microsoft.net.  All email addresses ending in .net will cease to
    exist, and Microsoft is recommending those users use its Hotmail
    internet email service.

    US arbitrator Simon West said, "While some of these companies
    like AT&T have legitimate claims, they fail to realize that
    Microsoft's .net strategy is bringing the next generation of
    windows services to the internet."

    In a separate ruling Microsoft was also given rights to
    bloatware.com, vaporware.com and monopoly.com.  In addition
    to the Microsoft rulings, Rush Limbaugh was given control of
    bigfatidiot.com.

	Has anybody else read The White Plague by Frank Herbert?  It was
published in 1982, but it is still very relevant to the current
discussion.  One man, driven by the murder of his wife and children,
creates a plague that targets women, and is 100% deadly.  Like most (all?)
of Herbert's works, this book tracks the lives of the powerful and
influential.  The decisions that the president of the US has to make are
very grim indeed.

	I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for a well thought
out analysis on the potential effects of a deadly engineered plague.  I
actually don't think a rhino/ebola virus combo would be quite as bad as
the white plague, because ebola is deadly to just about everyone in a
short amount of time and there are no asymptomatic carriers.  Of course,
you have to read the book to see that "not as bad" is no great comfort.

   Staff Writer, CNET News.com
   August 7, 2000, 2:35 p.m. PT

Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications have started off the
   week battling two different security problems: one that exposes a computer's
contents
   and another that makes computers vulnerable to a complete takeover....

Organizations in Georgia (they haven't returned my calls) so we can't

Just a couple of URL's of interest:

+: http://www.junkscience.org/, and http://www.cfis.org/
   the latter appears to have some interesting mailing lists
   that I can't figure out how to access, e.g. 
    http://www.cfis.org/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000006.html

-: http://www.dieoff.org/
   which has to be one of the more interesting negative sites
   with a wealth of links.

There are 87.144 million hosts today -- where are you
going to go?....

This whole story will, I think, reasonate with the public. It may generate 
some flack for Genetic Engineering.

It's very scary. This type of science does carry some real risk. But we are 
all dying anyway.

So I say, yes, we may pay some price for GE, but the way things have been 
going for humanity so far, we all pay the ultimate price in the end anyway. 
So in order to gain this knowledge, we  must take risks; if we want to beat 
death, risks must be taken.

Why, because of the usual we'll-keep-the-AI-locked-up blather?  I had

Unfortunately I can't think of a solution to this sort of thing, but this sort of thing
may be a solution to the Fermi Paradox.

Martin Ling <martin@nodezero.org.uk> asks about strong materials:

Sapphire whiskers (Al2O3) is the strongest material that has been
measured, a cable 2 inches across could support 10,000 tons.
Carbon nanotubes (bucky tubes) are almost certainly stronger but to
my knowledge a precise strength measurement hasn't been made.
Theoretically the strongest of all could be C3N4 if somebody could
make some, but nobody has yet.

Eli, you have to understand how to play the game. Explain to the sister
that you are involved in, PRAISE THE LORD, research into the true
ultimate and final purpose of the human race, and its purpose in the
Grand Scheme of Things. That yours is a lay organization doing the Good
Work of the Great Architect among the imperfect souls of the earth,
preparing man for the End of Dayz....  I'm sure they would be quite
happy to help you out with the paperwork. Be sure to show up at their
office with a fish pin on your collar....

I don't know about you guys, but a development like would seem to substantially
lessen our odds of making it off this rock.  I can think of several different
types of individuals who would have no qualms about developing and releasing
something like this:

1) Radical Environmentalists - the ones who believe humanity is a virus that
needs to be wiped out.

2) Terrorist organizations without sufficient foresight to see this will destroy
their plans as well.

3) Deeply disturbed individuals who became that way because of a personal
tragedy - like the character in 'The White Plague'.

and finally

4) All the other psycho's who don't fit into any of these categories.

With the tools to make such nasty viruses getting cheaper all the time, I'd say
there at least a 1000 people in the world with the motivation and knowledge to
pull something like this off - that would seem to make an outbreak a near
certainty.

So the golden question is - can we really survive one of these plagues, let
alone dozens of them?  And if a few of us did manage to survive, would it
matter?  Would there be any modern civilization left?  Would the transhuman
ambition become a bygone fantasy no longer capable of being pursued in any
practical manner?

This why we need to spread to the stars - it's our only chance.

Are there rough figures/estimates for either of these (basically, I just
need order of magnitude)?

FWIW, from what I've been told the result of the target body
change is a direct result of the failure the ASTRO-E launch
vehicle (M-V), which is also baselined to be used on its next
scheduled launch by MUSES-CN.  The redesign is taking too long
and would have resulted in missing the July 2002 window for 1989
ML, which itself was chosen over the primary (4660 Nereus)
because of decreasing spacecraft mass margins.

Additionally, I also understand that the engineering team has
recommended that the AXS (alpha/x-ray spectrometer) be dropped
from the nanorover to accomodate a battery.  This battery would
provide power for telemetry, as opposed to the solar panels
(there is a distinct possibility that the nanorover might land in
darkness or local shade), which apparently makes NASA nervous
about ensuring some kind of data return in a failure mode,
especially in the wake of recent Mars spacecraft failures.

fully consistent, fully conceptualist concept of ENTITY would be like, and
considers some apparent textual incongruities on the topic in Rand's
Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. This work-in-progress was
originally conceived as a further refinement of one aspect of my doctoral

therefore hope to receive rigorous professional critical feedback that
will be useful in its development.

Does Quantum Nonlocality Exist? Bell's Theorem and the
Many-Worlds Interpretation

Authors: Frank J. Tipler
Comments: 7 pages in plain TeX, no figures

    Quantum nonlocality may be an artifact of the assumption that observers
obey the laws of classical
    mechanics, while observed systems obey quantum mechanics. I show that,
at least in the case of
    Bell's Theorem, locality is restored if observed and observer are both
assumed to obey quantum
    mechanics, as in the Many-Worlds Interpretation. Using the MWI, I shall
show that the apparently
    "non-local" expectation value for the product of the spins of two
widely separated particles --- the
    "quantum" part of Bell's Theorem --- is really due to a series of three
purely local measurements.
    Thus, experiments confirming "nonlocality" are actually confirming the
MWI.

In the past, epidemics caused by virulent pathogens newly introduced into
human populations have tended to play out within a human generation due to a
couple of factors.  One factor is the evolution of the pathogen into a form
which is nonlethal to the host, the second being that the pathogen kills
susceptible individuals, leaving the population as a whole resistant. My
present understanding of molecular genetics doesn't lead me to believe that
the process of natural selection would fail due to the presence of alien
genes, so I would expect epidemics of the near future to follow the same
course as their historical predecessors. However, during the generation when
the pathogen is at its most lethal, past civilations have changed beyond
recognition.

There are other challenges facing us in addition to the risk of disease
epidemic. These include the wide-spread destruction of top soil,
historically positively correlated with the fall of civilizations; dwindling
amounts of easily extractable petroleum; and the cultural weariness of an
over-mature civilization. One of the things I like about the Extropians is
their determined sense of optimism, but I sometimes sense that it's being
purchased at the price of denial of the magnitude of the changes we'll be
dealing with in the coming 50-100 years.

A while back I read an interesting book called _How the Irish Saved
Civilization_ about the role played by Irish monks in preserving the written
works of the Romans as the western portion of the Empire crumbled into
illiterate pre-feudalism (for lack of a better term). The monks hid the
books in out of the way places, and although there was a period of time in
which the Roman knowledge lay dormant, it was there when later generations
were ready to appreciate it.

IMO, it would be wise for those of us who can see what may be coming to take
steps to preserve what knowledge we can, just in case history takes the
downhill road.  Someone recently joked about installing Eliezer in one of
the missile silos.  Possibly in another 30 years the idea won't seem like
such a joke after all.

You have a syntax error here. 

It should be:

 $egreeting =<<EOF;

It doesn't compile otherwise.

Also, if you're on a Unix system, you can make your .signature a fifo
using mkfifo, and you can keep this program running nohup by writing a
loop around it to keep it writing to the .sig file and closing after
each write.  This way each fresh read will get a fresh run.

The loop could look basically like this:

while(1) 
{
	 open (">/path/to/.sig") or die "Could not open .sig: $!";
	 
	 # do the rest of the program here
	 # ...
	 # be sure to close
	 close SIG or die "Got an error closing .sig: $!"; 
}

Note that I've added error checking to both system calls.  Always
check the return value from system calls.

Now, then, after you mkfifo .sig, all you need to do is execute the
program nohup:

nohup sigwriter &

And any read will get a fresh set of words.  If you want, you can put
a monitor job in your crontab or login to make sure it's still running
every now and then.  The best way would be to have it record its
process id on startup in a file you check for an extand pid by the
same process name.

All the best,
James

Is that Al2O3 correct? I didn't know that sapphire whiskers and
Aluminum oxide was the same material. Cool.

Al2O3 is the material that is released from the solid rocket motor
firings when pushing a satellite into higher orbits. This material
is among the most common debris material in orbit around the earth.

Here is a picture of an aluminum oxide sphere attached to a
micrometeroid (cosmic dust) particle:

I think that restore locality (or confirming nonlocality) by means of
the Many Worlds Interpretation ( I say MWI, not the original Everett's
Relative States Interpretation) is a contradiction in terms.
Nothing is more nonlocal than the Many Worlds!
Except, perhaps, the weird Many Minds Interpretation!

The Relational Interpretation (Rovelli), the Chameleon Interpretation
(Accardi), the Informational Interpretation (Adami, Cerf),
the Ithaca Interpretation (Mermin)
are stronger attempts (in my opinion) to undestand
the s.c. nonlocality (non-separability).

[Tipler says - in quant-ph/0003146 - that at spacelike separation
the measuring operators commute. Is it true? I'm not sure.]

Note that Bell's locality condition was analyzed during 1994
by Jarrett and shown to be equivalent to the conjunction of two
conditions. The violation of the first would permit the transmission
of a superluminal message. The violation of the second permits
the transmission (not superluminally) of a message from a
particle to the entangled one. At this time just the second
condition was shown to be violated. Not the first one. So the
the peaceful conspiracy between Q. MECH. and SP. REL. is safe.

 For large companies, it is hard to make managers interests coincide
with those of stockholders, and managers would clearly loose a good
deal of authority if IF markets produced good management decisions.
Stockholders could in theory order management to use IF markets, but
it would take a good deal of work to specify which decisions should
be made this way, free rider problems deter most stockholders from
making any effort, and select effects insure that most stockholders
think their companies are managed better than average already (singling
out one company to be the first to be dragged into a new management
process would tend to imply that there is something subpar about the
current management).

 There are a lot of small companies where managers own a large enough
fraction of the company that their interests as stockholders can override
their interests as managers, but they are usually small enough that the
knowledge that its employees possess isn't dispersed widely enough for
the means of using that information can be much improved by IF markets.
 There are significant legal obstacles to allowing non-employees to
bet real money. Making bonuses contingent on an IF market results poses
few legal problems, but once you allow people to invest/gamble money
that is already their property, expensive regulations apply. There are
enough entrenched special interests (casinos, financial markets) that
could loose business to IF markets that legal change won't happen easily.

 A few companies such as Microsoft have neither of theses obstacles, but
their existing management practices have produced good enough results that
they have little incentive to experiment with alternatives.

 I.e. IF markets might "merely" improve the ability to compare alternatives
that companies are currently comparing, rather than enabling them to
compare alternatives that are currently being overlooked.

 http://www.industryfutures.com is reportedly offering the appropriate
services for a company to run internal IF markets.

This is all great. Now what we need is an easily installable plugin for
netscape, microsoft mail, and eudora that people can install that does the same
thing to their sig file whenever they launch their mail reader. Promote its use
by the general population and echelon and carnivore are both dead.

Very cool article you have supplied us with. No surpise the the combination of the oligarchies that are the governments of the Gulf States., mixed in with the motivation of the USA based Oil Companies will go for all the market can bear.  Now that this info becomes know and some non-OPEC oil sites come on-line, the prices will stablize-but that may not take effect until this "new" oil comes into the market place! Maybe 5 years?

Another matter is the continued development of non-petroleum based transportation fuels, unless you folks believe that Dr. Thomas Gold may be correct that the oils are geophysical in nature and is not bio-organic, in its inception?

Interesting thread ..... I think there are many individuals, maybe even
governments (Serbia, Iraq) with a
grudge against the rest of the world ... not just eco-terrorists or
criminals who might try to blackmail
society.

By 'mental' do you mean telepathic eavesdropping, or plain old electronic
snooping?

>This why we need to spread to the stars - it's our only chance.

Hmmm ... escapist fantasy. What  makes the problem go away if we colonise
another planet .. you will still get the same types of nutter populating it.
Under the sea seems a better bet? Or enclosed cities (domes) ....

Maybe the answer lies with MVT (solution to the mind-body problem) and
benign psychotherapy on a large scale? At least agreement on some central
questions (such as competing religio-supernaturalist systems) would remove
areas of conflict and argument.

As post-humans, don't we bear some responsibility to "dragging up" the
educational and evolutionary level of those who haven't even made it to
Bodhisattva state?

These new risks (hackers bringing down internet, Ebola &c) should make us
try *harder* to keep all the disaffected individuals on board and satisfied
with their lives.

Being a plant-person I'd really like to see more research on growing

The problem is, going to the stars is really too expensive to be
practical.  It would be much cheaper to go live underground, in
hermetically sealed chambers, getting power and light from the surface.

Or you could just live on the surface itself, in a sealed house.
This will give you far more opportunities than in a spaceship.
You can still share in the full richness of human culture, without
being isolated.

Besides, even if you go to the stars, if you take someone else or
have children, one of them might become unhappy and mix up some
Ebola, and then you'd still be screwed.

>
> Authors: Frank J. Tipler

It's been known for a long time that Bell's Theorem does not apply
to the MWI in terms of showing nonlocality.  Tipler refers to a paper
from 1982 which makes that point.

The basic idea of Tipler's analysis echoes Mike Price's Many-Worlds
FAQ, Q32, "What about Bell's inequality?"  See for example at
http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/many-worlds-faq.html.
Mike follows the same reasoning, looking at the experiment in terms
of three local measurements, and counting the splits.  Tipler does
go into more detail with the math, though.

Mike's conclusion:

: So where did Bell and Eberhard go wrong?  They thought that all theories
: that reproduced the standard predictions must be non-local.  It has been
: pointed out by both Albert [A] and Cramer [C] (who both support
: different interpretations of QM) that Bell and Eberhard had implicity
: assumed that every possible measurement - even if not performed - would
: have yielded a *single* definite result.  This assumption is called
: contra-factual definiteness or CFD [S].  What Bell and Eberhard really
: proved was that every quantum theory must either violate locality *or*
: CFD.  Many-worlds with its multiplicity of results in different worlds
: violates CFD, of course, and thus can be local.

Tipler's result is not fundamentally new at all, although as I said he
does work out some of the math in more detail.

One comment from Tipler struck me as odd:

> it is a presupposition of the MWI that only coefficients with rational
> squares are allowed since irrational squares would imply an irrational
> number of worlds

I think Tipler meant an "infinite number of worlds", since he is
apparently thinking that the coefficient squares represent ratios of
worlds, and irrationals could only be considered as ratios of infinite
values.

Of course the conventional mathematical formalism for QM does allow for
arbitrary irrational (in fact, complex) coordinates.  If the MWI really
exerted this restriction then it would be more than an interpretation.
For example, given a vertically polarized photon, to express its state
in a basis tilted at angle alpha involves cos(alpha) and sin(alpha) as
coordinates.  Apparently with the MWI we need to define new functions
that are like sin and cos but which always have rational outputs?
I don't think so.

Gold' theory does have quite a bit of support, and this support is increasing.
Whether it holds though is another question.

No thanks, agrifuel technology may not cause a net increase in CO2 levels, but
it does greatly erode the amount of topsoil available, unless you are thinking
of growing the plants in the ocean... My thoughts are that fossil fuels should
be used to create Fuller Cable for a sky hook system, with solar power sats and
radiator systems in orbit. The sky hooks not only carry cargo up and down, but
heat. The base of a sky hook should be near a shoreline or on an island so that
surface water can be cooled by conducting its heat to space, thus helping to
reduce any greenhouse warming, no matter if it is coming from pollution or
normal Malenkovich Cycles, while at the same time generating electricity from
the thermal differential....

Ever hear of permaculture?

The sky hooks are a great idea (I think, although I'm not sure since I don't
understand the details of the engineering), but it seems as though one would
want to have more than one iron in the fire.

Well, yeah, I didn't explain this very well, but I mean several things.  The
ways in which we can predict 'intention' are likely to evolve over the next
little while-- today it pretty much lies in the realm of behavior profiling.
If our intellects are networked, it might be a little snooper bot that
cracks your brain and looks for dangerous precursor patterns.

This is the next step in the arms race against the release of outrageously
lethal technologies.  There are some crimes that it's not acceptable to
allow to happen even once.

Ja, and another headache is how prevent taking malicious
individuals with us when we leave this rock, or breeding new
ones there.  In the age of technology sufficiently advanced that
a single murderous individual has the power to wipe out the entire
population, even universal surveillance might be insufficient
protection.  We would need big-brother-esque detection
of malicious thought patterns.

Bill Joy's notion of relinquishing biotechnology would still
not totally protect, for the thought police would be needed
to ensure that *everyone* complied with the agreement.
Now, this is a rather revolting development.  {8-[  spike

The shortage is not crude oil, its refinery capacity.  The greens and
open spacers keep finding clever ways to legaaly block expansion of capacity.
This in addition to the multibillion dollar lawsuits against those refineries
which suffer the occasional accident or release of pollutant.

When I hear news media bleating about how the techno-advanced
devour a disproportionate share of natural resources, I would
reassure them that they need not worry, for we are well on our
way to legislating ourselves into a neo-stone age.  spike

Yes, but even if we took these individuals with us, and some enclaves got
wiped out by them, there would still be some that wouldn't. As long as
we're on just one world all our eggs are in one basket. It doesn't even
have to be a disease or nuclear catastrophe that destroys us. It can be
something as subtle as cultural stagnation... or a particularly tenacious
world-wide ruling class. Globaly, as well as locally, it is increasingly
necessary to decentralize, distribute, and diversify.

>Bonnie wrote:  Being a plant-person I'd really like to see more

I did a back of the envelope calculation on this question:
Assuming no GM, what if we used all the land now under
cultivation to grow corn, which is then distilled into
alcohol to burn in our guzzlers?  How much would our
oil consumption drop?

Corn yield/acre about 150 bushels / acre:
http://www.financialexpress.com/fe/daily/19990823/fec23064.html

Ethanol yield about 2.5 gal / bushel:
http://www.stinker.com/ethanol/corn.html

Energy consumed in corn production & ethanol production:
Agriculture: 25%
Production: 33%
Total:           58%

So net yield is 42% of gross yield, so

Net yield 150 * 2.5 * .42 = 157 gal / acre

Total US Farm land in 1990 from Almanac: 988,000,000 acres

Ethanol 7.6E4 BTU / gal

Imagine all US farmland in corn, 1.6E2 * 9.9E8 * 7.6E4 = 1.2E16 BTU

Total US petroleum products consumption in 1989:  3.4E16 BTU.

So if all the proles now growing anything grew corn instead, and we
distilled
it and burned it in our detroits, we would displace about a third of
the oil currently being used.

We use a loooootta energy.  Note, however that in 1960 there was
more land under cultivation than today.  Furthermore, if one ever
takes a flight across the U.S. one sees vast tracts of land, vaaaast
tracts, simply lying fallow, going to waste!  Not being used to make
fuel for my guzzler at all, but rather simply being infested by wild
beasts and filthy vermin!  Utterly deplorable.

Nowthen, if we all went with the new highly efficient hybrid fuel autos,

our demand would drop dramatically.  Furthermore, with appropriate
GM, {both Genetic Modification and General Motors} totally renewable
energy transportation is within our grasp.  spike

Same elements, but not the same molecular structure.  Fortunately
we can make sapphire in bulk.  The THAAD missile seeker window
is a single crystal sapphire.  The recent order of 1100 of those
windows has caused the price of manufactured sapphire to drop
noticeably.

Right but the use of solid motors is being strongly discouraged for
use in orbital transfer maneuvers, for the resulting slag may damage
existing satellites.  Perhaps Doug knows the last time such a thing
was used.  I dont know of a solid being used recently.  The notion
that solids deposit materials that could later be used for other
purposes
has never occurred to me.  Amara!  Run to the patent office and
claim all orbiting slag.

So this material has a natural source?  I guess I could see why that
would be, for whatever caused the asteroid belt (planetary
collision) would leave yottagrams of dust, which would likely be
aluminum oxide.

Cool thanks!  Im guessing the spherical one is the Al2O3,
resulting from a solid rocket motor burn in orbit.  spike

Along with the capacity for interstellar travel comes the possibility of
interstellar weaponry.  Granted, it would be a lot easier to wipe out the
local community, just like most muderously deranged individuals today
target their family, fellow employees, or school.  But we are talking
about insanity targetted against all of humanity.  Leaving earth won't
help.  You would have to leave earth and become completely isolated from
the rest of humanity.  Even that isn't a complete gurantee.

All in all, I think our best hope will be to bring about the singularity
asap.  Human beings can't be trusted with the technologies we have for too
much longer, as painful as that is for me to say.

Not to mention different lifestyles in which, for example, people didn't
drive as much as they do now. And in which people used landscaping that
didn't involve turf grasses that have to be mowed and watered (I wonder how
many BTU lawnmowers use each year).

You're right, most of them are pretty bad, although I thought the Tagari
Farm site was better than most, and I know from talking to people that the
farm itself is very well done.  If there were more thinking like the thought
which created that farm, humans could be a keystone species rather than the
problem species they often are.

In real life, many of the people who say they're doing permaculture farms
are not; and they often do very silly things.  For example, some people I
knew near Austin bought 1000's of young fruit trees and planted them only a
foot or so apart.

Of the accredited universities I know of which offer permaculture-type
programs, the University of California at Davis has the best.  The last time
I was in Davis I stopped by a very nice permaculture garden some of the
students were growing on campus.  In the City of Davis (not associated with
the University), there's a subdivision called Village Homes that's designed
using permaculture principles.  I think you'll find these sites pretty much
free of new age fuzziness.

Plants produce a lot of cellulose, so yields could be far higher than

That said, we'd still need an awful lot of land.

Widely scattered space habitats would inherently slow the spread of
diseases, particularly if travel time is measured in days rather than
hours.  The time en route would allow more thorough health & agriculture
screening than is the norm today, so the main vector for engineered
diseases would be active distribution devices instead of unknowingly
infected carriers.

Distributed systems are robust, even though some nodes might be lost to
hostile action.  None of this addresses how we make it through the next
decade or two, though.

An adjacent paper by Deutsch suggests that the topic was not necessarily

There are no purely classical means in nature, of course. But yes, we proved
that in all phenomena that have hitherto been deemed to demonstrate
non-locality (in particular, EPR experiments and quantum teleportation) the
quantum information travels by purely local means, in decoherent information
channels (e.g. down a telephone line).

Right, but as I said before, wouldn't you get much the same effect
for much less expense by putting those space habitats on the ground?
Of course, a space habitat has the advantage of cheap access to vacuum
and intense sunlight, but an earth habitat has compensating advantages
of its own.

It would be much easier to develop self-contained ground habitats than
space ones.  Even the simple fallout shelters of the 1960s could sustain
life for a period of weeks or months.

That was an interesting paper by Deutsch.  I wrote something about it
at http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q99/2552.html.  I don't
recall whether he discussed Bell's Theorem but his ideas might apply
there as well.

No, silly, it hasn't happened yet. But at least we're *talking* about it.

I'm happy to report that a long Singularity essay by me is the cover story
in today's `Australian's Review of Books', a monthly upscale lift-out (`A
Journal of Ideas' is the sub-title) with the national newspaper. The
full-page cover illo is kinda cute: Cary Grant, running in terror through
`North by Northwest' wheat fields, cellphone clipped to his belt, as an
Independence Day monster starship looms across the sky blasting a ferocious
particle beam in his hapless wake.

Ja, I intentionally calculated it closed loop style, so a gallon of ethanol
per bushel is a pretty good estimate methinks.  I shoulda converted it
into realistic units for the rest of the world.  Hell, *I* dont even know
how much a bushel is.  But we could go to liters and hectares, since
a hectare is (I think) a square 100 meters on a side, so theres about
256 hectares to the square mile and 640 acres to the square mile
(Im doing this all from memory so do be kind if I blow the conversion)
so we figured about 150 gallons per acre year, so

150 gal/acre * 3.87 liters / gal * 640 acres / 256 hectare ~ 1450
liters/hectare.

Ja, but we have it.  We are sitting here on a big empty country and
we throw countless zettaliters of fresh water into the sea every day.
We really should stop doing that.  And we can GM the corn to
make more fuel.

That being said, the same land could be used to set up windmills
too.  Windmills and cornfields should cohabitate nicely.  spike

In the USA, wind turbines need to be connected to some effective storage 
system, specifically fuel cells, to be the most vital. However, the 
marketplace seems to dictate merely getting in the wind turbines 1st. Grasses 
inter-mixed with GM crops like weed-trees, or soy should greatly reduce soil 
erosion. The focus of fuel crops appears to be most useful with 
transportation fuels for autos, and trucks, and construction vehicles. My 
earlier comment regarding Dr. Thomas Gold and his estimates that most 
petroleum is of abiological origin, and that supplies potentially exist in 
the hundred times range of current oil estimates. Such a "wildcard" would 
obviate the economics of energy production for centuries.

Here is a table of some rough tensile strengths (real and theoretical) and 
a list of my sources. I couldn't find anything on Aluminum Whiskers, 
although I know I've seen a table on the Web that included them once. 
IIRC, they have a higher tensile strength than carbon whiskers, but are 
more than proportionately denser, making them an inferior choice for this 
sort of application:

We can look at the quantum non-locality
from two *very* different points of view.

>From the *abstract* point of view many authors have
pointed out that the quantum non-locality (EPR problem, etc.)
does not exist or that it is not a weird phenomenon.

Accardi i.e. shows that quantum non-locality, EPR, Bell's
conditions are easily intelligible, in classical terms.
It is well known his classical, Bell-type, real experiment.
quant-ph/0007019, quant-ph/0007005.

Adami and Cerf i.e. have shown that quantum measurement
and non-locality are easily intelligible by means of
information theory. Heisenberg and J.Rothstein (and
now Zeilinger) had the same idea.
quant-ph/9806047, quant-ph/9605039, quant-ph/9605002,
quant-ph/9611032.

Rovelli i.e. suggested that the notion of observer-independent state
was non correct andI reformulated the problem of the interpretation
of quantum mechanics in terms of information theory.
All systems are assumed to be equivalent, there is no observer-observed
distinction, and the theory describes only the information 
that systems have about each other.
quant-ph/9609002.

The same thing did Mermin, in his Ithaca Interpretation.
quant-ph/9807055, quant-ph/9801057, quant-ph/9711052,
quant-ph/9609013.

The M.W.I. is useful too, as John Bell pointed out
(this interpretation was dead at that time!). But this
interpretation has lots of problems: no collapse means no
entropy?; solipsism or worse; inner or radical non-locality.

But from the *physical* point of view nobody (!) 
is able  to *explain* those quantum non-locality experiments
or those quantum non-separability experiments, 
i.e. the identical behaviour of those entangled particles 
inside those Franson-type interferometers, 
or the weird quantum-eraser exp., or the ghost interference exp., 
etc. etc. etc.

This one is especially delicious:

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0007009

since

<Entangled photons are sent via an optical fiber network to two
    villages near Geneva, separated by more than 10 km where they are
analyzed by
    interferometers. The photon pair source is set as precisely as possible
in the center so that
    the two photons arrive at the detectors within a time interval of less
than 5 ps
    (corresponding to a path length difference of less than 1 mm). One
detector is set in motion
    so that both detectors, each in its own inertial reference frame, are
first to do the
    measurement! The data always reproduces the quantum correlations,
making it thus more
    difficult to consider the projection postulate as a compact description
of real collapses of the
    wave-function. >

What fun! Each photon does its utterly uncaused thing *first*, entraining
the other...

There's nothing wrong with vets speculating about nanotech, but it seems
curiously focused.  Every field will be impacted.  Will we see separate
lists discussing the effects of nanotech on plumbing? gardening? engine
design? apparel?  dentistry? heating and air conditioning? cleaning
clothes? drawing and painting? garbage collection? travel and
tourism? home and office furniture? sidewalk repair? cosmetics? TV and
video? haircutting?

The problem with focussing on such specific areas is that it tends to
fragment the larger discussion of the basic capabilities of nanotech.
How much do vets, or cosmetologists, or concrete suppliers know about
nanotech?  Their fields will be changed beyond recognition, undoubtedly.
But it's hard to estimate when, or how the changes will be phased in,
with our present state of knowledge.  It seems premature to try to set up
topic specific discussion lists when we know so little about the details.

It's not clear what an "explanation" would constitute when you are talking
about these phenomena.  Usually when we ask "why", we want an explanation
in terms of simpler principles.  But the fundamental workings of QM are
the simplest theory that we have today.  Until we come up with a more
fundamental theory than QM we can't expect to explain these phenomena
other than to say that they fit the theory.

As far as explanations for why QM is true, I've seen two directions.
One is the anthropic principle.  We see that QM gives us nice chemistry,
plenty of common, stable elements each with its own unique chemical
and physical properties.  This allows not only for life, but also a
diverse and stimulating environment that eventually led to intelligence.
The anthropic principle tells us, given that we exist, that we will need
some similar blend of stability and diversity.

There is also the hope that our universe might turn out to be the
*simplest* one possible that leads to life and intelligence.  The universe
is described by the laws of physics and the initial conditions.  I find
hope in that it seems that the initial state of the universe may have been
very simply described.  It was apparently a uniform, hot ball of energy.
>From this, along with QM and gravitation, all of the complexity of the
universe developed.  The simplicity of the initial conditions lends hope
that the combination of initial conditions plus laws of physics may
also turn out to be relatively simple, among universes which can give
rise to intelligence.  This might give us a philosophical basis to say
"why" QM is true.

Hello,

I would like to ask other peoples' ideas about weather control.  Can
rain, hurricanes and lightning be organized?

I think there are technical methods that could be explored to see how to
do some of those kinds of things in terms of altering weather patterns.

There are almost certainly researches about this kind of thing.

There's a LOT of cornfields now....I know that for a fact since I'm in the
business of taking Combines and Tractors to the people who grow corn.  The
problem is economics.  There is MORE capacity to grow corn than there is
demand FOR that corn at a price that justifies growing more corn.  So
there's lots of difficulties.  Farmers going broke etc.

It's political...as is everything.

Also there are more and more WindFarms going up.  The two most prominent
areas are just east of the Bay Area and just east of BakersField in
Taxifornia.  There are however many more locations being built.  I've
noticed that the windfarms tend to be on land that's just about worthless
for anything else...except maybe sheep.  Different land than cornfields....

I was under the impression the 747 was originally designed to be a military
cargo plane, but was beaten out by the C-5, so Boeing put it on the
commercial market.

Wow.  This is extremely exciting news; I don't think we're too far off the
real thing, now.

Ja, well Lockheed kicked Boeing butt that time.  Of course, they
kicked ours in the 747 vs L1011 contest...  {8-[  spike

Hello everyone,

I wish to tell you about a very worthwhile organization which deserves 
donations from extropian list members.  It is the Institute for Neural 
Cryobiology.  The research program for it is called the Cryopreservation of 
Hippocampal Slices Project.  The goal is perfected vitrification of the 
brain.

I now share with you a list of the leadership who are trying to push the 
work forward.

The founder and chairman of the board is Thomas Donaldson, Ph.D. - Founder 
and Chairman of the Board Thomas Donaldson has a PhD in mathematics and has 
published one technical book and several long papers on partial differential 
equations and related techniques. He has published many articles of 
speculative science in the popular magazine Analog Science Fiction and Fact. 
One of these, 24th Century Medicine, has been reprinted and anthologized. He 
has also written a reference book for anyone seriously interested in using 
some of the drugs known to increase lifespan in animals -  A Guide To 
Antiaging Drugs.

Thomas Donaldson has been reading and teaching himself about cryobiology and 
neuroscience, since the early 1970's. Since 1991 he has been publisher and 
editor of Periastron, his own newsletter about cryobiology, neuroscience, 
memory, consciousness and identity.

He can be reached at
tdonald@hubble.dialix.com.au

Paul Wakfer - Director and President
Paul Wakfer is a 62 year old Canadian whose home is in Toronto, but who has 
spent much time in Southern California. Paul is family oriented, treasures 
the innocence and wonder of bright young minds, and enjoys spending time 
with his grandchildren. Since childhood Paul has believed that the 
degeneration of aging was to be fought, prevented and overcome, especially 
in regard to age related mental diseases and decline. While working to 
promote this, he practices a healthy and mentally enhancing lifestyle to the 
extent that this is determinable from current knowledge. This includes a 
calorie restricted diet, extensive use of nutritional supplements, and 
significant mental and physical exercise.
Paul is an honors graduate of the University of Toronto in Engineering 
Physics (BASc - 1959) and received a master's degree in Applied Mathematics 
(1960). In 1959, he won the Canadian Association of Physicist's prize in a 
nationwide competition of undergraduate physics students.

Paul has held the following positions:

Research Assistant & Graduate Student, Courant Institute of Mathematical 
Sciences, New York Univ (1960-1962)
RCAF Flight Lieutenant and Mathematics Instructor, College Militaire Royale, 
St. Jean, Quebec (1962-1964)
Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Scarborough College, University of 
Toronto (1964-1970)
Canada Council Fellow and Graduate Student, McMaster University, (1970-1972)
Computer Analyst & Consultant, Hardware/Software Instructor, Control Data 
Corporation (1973-1983)
Chief Systems Integrator of postal automation systems, Computing Devices of 
Canada (1978-1981)
Designer/instructor of "Microcomputer Hardware for the Technically Oriented" 
(1983-1990)
President, Cryovita Laboratories, Inc. (1992-1996)
Cofounder and Executive Director, 21st Century Medicine (1993-1994)
Paul has been a self-employed computer consultant for over 20 years. In 
Toronto, from 1983 to 1991, he started and operated a very successful full 
service computer business.

Paul has always maintained a burning interest in all the sciences and in 
bettering the human condition by rational means. After selling his business 
in 1991, Paul became a frequent visitor to the US in order to further this 
interest. Since then he has been very active in the life extension movement 
and instrumental in funding and encouraging life extension research, as 
president of Cryovita Laboratories, as a founder of 21st Century Medicine, 
and now, as President of The Institute for Neural Cryobiology. Paul is also 
a member of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.

I have donated twenty dollars to the organization myself.  Not very much, 
but at least it is something.  Considering my income it is actually a 
generous donation.  I would ask all of you to please seriously consider a 
financial donation.

This organization desperately needs funding to keep going and Ben Best has 
donated ten thousand himself; though he is not by any means a rich man.  Dr. 
Greg Fahy is a strong believer in the project and for those of you who know 
of his reputation that should say something.  Please, just donate what you 
can.


sincerely,

John Grigg

I thought scerir was pointing out that although QT is simple in the Ockham
sense and works rather well, it appears to contain key elements that are...
*silly, too silly*. When you have a gadget that switches a light on with
the photons that are emitted from the light that has been switched on (to
use a clumsy analogy), I reckon you're in trouble, even though it does
possess a wonderful zany simplicity.

OK, lets look at what Rifkin said.  [Comments in square brackets mine.]

"Every parent wants the best for their child,"
              said Rifkin.

[OK, nothing too controversial in that comment.]

"In the future, the parent could

              ultimate shopping experience.

[Sounds good to me.]

[He was doing great until this comment, which demonstrates
that he is an idiot.  I know of no laws requiring lower classes
to have fewer babies.]

"we will just have them have better
              babies as we learn to do gene therapy."

[RIGHT!  Right you are, Jeremy Rifkin!  Who would have
any argument with people having better babies?]  spike

The L-1011 is my favorite air liner. I used to love to fly on them with
TWA when flying from Seattle to Boston nonstop. The huge legroom that
coach seats had was incredible (wide seats too).

Spike, Rifkin's referring to the traditional eugenics platform, which *did*
suggest laws restricting the number of kids that `stupid', `degenerate',
`worthless' poor people might have. That was a bad, offensive approach that
has given the whole idea of genetic improvement the stench it has today
(well, and Hitler's borrowing of it didn't help, either).

Actually I've rarely seen such a vulgar composite of old rubbish
masquerading as a BBC news report.

I especially relished:

Ah, this explains why they send their kids to Eton, eh? Then again, I
suppose intelligence per se has never been a big consideration in Tory
schooling.

Mike- 

One of the advantatages of working in the cosmic dust field, is that I
have special access to all of the dust jokes. Sometimes,
unintentionally.

During one of my first dust talks, a couple of years ago at a
conference in Slovakia, I was having some trouble removing a piece of
dust that had stubbornly attached itself to one of my viewgraphs,
which was about the Jovian dust streams.

The irony of my trying to remove a piece of dust on my viewgraph,
which was all about dust, was not lost on some of my audience. In
particular, there was a group of people in the back that were laughing
so hard, that they almost fell off of their chairs. And I didn't know
what they were finding so funny, and I was flustered and embarassed
about my stuborn piece of dust!

I did survive my talk, and one of them told me afterwards what they
found so funny. It seems that I was a perfect straight man in a comedy
skit during my own presentation, unintentionally.

Since then, I use dust jokes, whenver possible. I put every dust joke
I could think of, including the "dust bunnies under the bed" joke in
my Sky and Telescope interplanetary dust article, that I wrote this
summer. I don't know what, in the article, will finally appear in
print (or when it will appear in print), but I hope that they keep my
dust jokes...

When your british aristos keep marrying their cousins, it does, I think,
impact upon the results. Eton is merely a finishing school so the most
impaired don't drool on themselves in public...

It was posted here recently that cities effect weather patterns. They soak 
up heat during the day (black rooftops and pavement) and release it at 
night, so extreme weather patterns - I think I'm getting this right - tend 
to move around them.
How about "paving" large tracts of land with a material which can change the 
rate at which it gives off/soaks up heat. It would be like a national 
highway system, with the highways being miles long. By changing the 
temperature properties at key points in space and time, you could steer a 
weather pattern wherever you wanted it to go, or at least play an influence. 
Maybe steer all the hurricanes into a winmill-populated plane.

Mine too.  Even my modern standards it is a very comfortable aircraft
for the long haul.  If you want an interesting discussion of the L1011
vs its real competitor the Douglas DC 10, Ben Rich discusses it in his
book Skunk Works.  The DC10 had the straight thru tail engine, which
forced the rudder to be shorter, which required the wing engines to
be closer inboard so that in a one-engine-out condition, the shorter
rudder could overcome the resultant yaw.  The L1011 had the more
expensive and complicated (Lockheed loves to do things this way
whenever possible) S-shaped thrust duct, allowing a longer rudder,
allowing the wing engines to be further outboard, so the passenger
compartment is quieter.  The company calculated it would need to
sell 250 of the 1011s to break even, and it sold 246 if memory
serves correctly.  spike

Individual trees modify "microclimate".   A few more trees make a major
difference in heating/cooling a house (wind breaks).  I would expect that a
forest would have a larger effect.

This might be for OR against allowing trees to grow.  Personally I like
Utah.

I should have guessed the apparent silliness of the comment was
a result of curious random inclusion by the reporting medium.
But hey, I even bought one of Rifkin's books once, The End of Work.
He states many things I agree with, but our outlooks on these
statements are opposite.  For instance, many Rifkinites will
state that people will soon be able to genetically engineer our
offspring.  Rifkin et.al. merely state the fact with an unstated:
"oh, the horror."  I come away with an unstated: kewallll.

Define please, Tory?  Is that what we would call a Democrat?  Please
excuse my ignorance.  We are getting better tho.  The internet is much
better at delivering international news than American television and
newspapers.  Ive notices a lot of the news delivered by my ISP is
from the BBC.  spike

Remember though that it was Niels Bohr who said, the theory is silly,
but is it silly enough to be true?  (Or was that Monty Python?)

Don't be surprised if nobody laughs, because your jokes are obviously as

Ther was a science article in Analog around 10-15 years ago in which the
author proposed very large cooling tower-like structures to be placed in
hurricane susceptible regions.  By large, read 6 km high by 1 km wide-
these would work by encouraging a single large, efficient convection
cell in place of many smaller ones, without disruption due to surface
and midaltitude winds.  The updraft would improve heat transfer from the
surface to high altitude, resulting in local cooling and
dehumidification to remove the power source for hurricanes (compare to
the siphons proposed for Lake Nyos in the Cameroon to prevent another
CO2 eruption).

The condensation of water in the updraft would make it much warmer and
thus lighter than the air outside the tower, providing the power to
drive the circulation.

The updraft would be fast enough to skydive in, and wind turbines near
the base could tap off some of the power in the draft.  Condensation in
the tower could be captured and lowered through hydro turbines to
generate more power- and would be a useful source of fresh water.

A strong rain cloud would pour out the top, producing continuous rain in
the region downwind of the tower.  The environmental impact statement
would be prodigious...

As a memory researcher I like to joke about forgetfulness in my talks,
but I usually forget the jokes...

(That was of course based on a joke so old that it probably existed in
the primordial nebula alongside with the dust :-)

OK, lets look at what Rifkin said.  [Comments in square brackets mine.]

"Every parent wants the best for their child,"
              said Rifkin.

[OK, nothing too controversial in that comment.]

"In the future, the parent could
              become an architect and each child the
              ultimate shopping experience.

[Sounds good to me.]

              "In the next 10 or 20 years we could have
              eugenics with a smiling face.

[Sounds good to me.]

"We will no longer
              require the lower classes to have fewer
              babies;

[He was doing great until this comment, which demonstrates
that he is an idiot.  I know of no laws requiring lower classes
to have fewer babies.]

"we will just have them have better
              babies as we learn to do gene therapy."

[RIGHT!  Right you are, Jeremy Rifkin!  Who would have
any argument with people having better babies?]  spike
(end)

Jeremy Rifkin did not use the argument I was so sure he would!!  I would have bet money he would say, "the upper-classes will be able to pay to have their children given superior intelligence while the lower-classes won't have the option" and "And this will create an even worse imbalance among the have's and have-not's within our society" and "Don't the wealthy already have enough advantages?"

I should go work for the guy to help him out... ;)

Regardless of what we may think of Rifkin he seems to be one of the
people who Get It when it comes to upcoming changes in the human
condition and our relationship to nature. That doesn't preclude him
from making huge mistakes (like the fourth law of thermodynamics), but
he seems to share an understanding with us what technology may be able
to achieve. The same goes for Bill Joy.

The big difference is basic values: we embrace change and
possibilities and think that a dynamist process can solve problems,
while Rifkin (and Joy to some extent) instead see these changes as bad
and undesirable, and that they pose threats that can only be dealt
with using technocratic or reactionary methods. The values are basic
and not likely to go away just by some side having good arguments,
what can be dealt with is how they are expressed and implemented.

There are a lot of people out there who Don't Get It, of course. When
they hear about nanotechnology they say 'Oh, a better way of making
stuff. So what?' since they don't see the vast mesh of drastic changes
such a technology would lead to. Maybe they are a bit imagination
challenged :-) Also, we should remember that they are a necessary
antidote to the 'foo-tech will change *everything*!' meme that easily
enraptures us (and our opponents) - if we have to explain clearly and
rationally just why a certain technology or trend will be likely and
cause major changes, there is a higher chance that we will be believed
and that our ideas subjected to the critical examination (by ourselves
and others) they need.

Perhaps it is possible to modify wind currents using various methods.  If that
is so, then perhaps water also, if not because it is a gaseous versus a liquid
medium.

The cell tower you describe sounds like a lightning rod for hurricanes.

Have you considered playing that old Kansas song  "Dust in the Wind" during

(somewhat tongue-in-cheek answer)

From: Warm-Blooded Plants and Freeze-Dried Fish by Freeman J. Dyson

http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm

"Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water
is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the
water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in
the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed
into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look
for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried
fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter."

Maybe, if there were many tornado cell constructions as you described that were
solid then they could have turbines to generate electricity back from the system
after it was let go.

We might also consider gyroscopes and other kinds of inertial capacitors.

There has been quite a bit of work done on inducing rain by seeding
clouds with microcrystals of silver iodide, with apparently commercial
results.

There is also an UN treaty prohibiting the use of weather control for
warfare.

yes, it was Bohr, in response to the Heisenburg-Pauli unified field theory. The
exact quote goes "We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question
which divides us is whether it is crazy enough."

That doesn't parse well.  Do you mean to modify ocean currents?  Since
they are driven by very massive salinity and temperature variations
across thousands of kilometers, it would be difficult to influence
them.  Air is a thousand times easier to work with (literally, by
density) and convection has a vertical scale of only 11 km or so.

Yes, intended to dissipate the energy continuously rather than
catastrophically. Ya gotta admire the sheer scale of the megaengineering
concept- hundreds of miles-tall towers, whirring with wind and hydro
turbines, vacuuming up all flying creatures near the base and hurling
them skyward.  (This would also include small aircraft and wayward
pedestrians.)

On the gripping hand, suppressing hurricanes could be as bad
ecologically as suppressing fires in the forests of North America has
been- the current system is evolved not just to accommodate storms, but
likely requires them.

I followed some of those Ponzi schemes for a few months early this year
after they were described here.  StockGeneration did crash around March
or April, devaluing everyone's "stock" but then trying once again to
drum up business for people to get in and take advantage of the new low,
low prices.  Other schemes with names like DigitalStocks and EMutualFun
have stepped in to offer alternatives.

The basic idea of all of these is you buy a "virtual stock" (for real
money) which is more or less guaranteed to go up in value.  The way
they achieve this is by using the money from later investors to pay off
those who want to withdraw early.  They hope that most people will be
satisfied with paper profits and stay in the game long enough to bring
in more suckers by telling tales of riches.

That's the really sad part of all of this; there is a multi-level
marketing angle by which you bring people into the game via referrals,
and get bonuses as a result.  Plus, most investors realize that the only
hope they have of seeing real money is if they can get more people to
come in.  So the players find themselves essentially forced to become
hucksters for the games.  Even if they come to realize that the games
are essentially fraudulent, the only hope they have to get their money
out is to suck in more people.

There were a number of sad posts on the Delphi message boards where the
players congregate in which people turned against the games and admitted
that their previous postings, full of glowing hucksterism, were fraudulent
and only motivated to try to raise interest in the games.  In some cases
players admitted to having misled potential investors with stories of
how much money they had made and successfully withdrawn from the game.
Once they realized that no amount of promotion was going to work, they
gave up and came clean.

I was especially disappointed by the posts here by Frederick Mann,
a well known "freedom entrepreneur".  By promoting these Ponzi schemes
(especially on his bigbooster.com web site) he is essentially enriching
himself at the cost of those he suckers in to feed his downline.  Even as
one game after another collapses, he continues to try to draw people in.
Presently he is promoting DigitalStocks, as StockGeneration has fallen
off his radar, conveniently forgotten.  He has very little credibility
in my book.

Prof. Bruno Touschek (extremely talented,
he worked with W.Heisenberg) told me that, sometimes,
he too (and Heisenberg too!) was in trouble
with the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
He used to look at things (problems) from all possible
points of view: wave-like, particle-like, entropy, fields, etc.
He wrote a sort of counter-history of quantum mechanics,
based on the never done experiments.
But now he is dead and his very interesting book
is still unpublished.

So how do you brutally cancel a subscription? Do you wrap each page around dog

Gee, do they get pre cooked, or does Jupiters EM field microwave them?? Kinda
makes dynamiting fish look pale by comparison.... ;)

This is something that, as some people who know me personally know, bothers me
greatly about society in general: how easy it is in large societies to defraud
people without worry about its impact upon your reputation, since you can always
'move down the street' where nobody has heard of your previous scams. I've found
this to be particularly true in big cities, as well as on the internet. While
some websites have established 'reputation brokers' within their own websites, I
am not aware of any large public reputation brokerage sites that are available
to all, outside of standard 'consumer review' type sites that focus on products
made by large manufacturers.

Its for this reason that I say that liberty is not freedom, it is
responsibility. Doing what thou wilt and skipping off, impervious to the
consequences, into the sunset is not exercizing liberty, it is abusing it.
Freedom only results when everyone is responsible for the  actions they
committed as a result of their liberties.

The exact quote [of Bohr] goes "We are all agreed that your theory is crazy.
The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough."

Fine. And note that against the EPR argument
(measuring a photon influences
the entangled space-like separated photon?)
Bohr was able to say just this:

Here is .... no question of a mechanical disturbance
of the system under investigation ....
there is essentially the question of an influence
on the very conditions which define the possible
types of predictions regarding the future behaviour
of the system.

(W.Churchill refused a Bohr's proposal,
about the construction of the A-bomb in GB,
because Bohr was so ... obscure)

Yes, and Chinese schoolbooks still claim that tiger bones and rhino horns are
good for longevity and as aphrodesiacs. Now, its fun to poke fun at them, as
well as take them seriously when its profitable (I know that there are many
Puget Sound indians who are now heavy into scuba diving to harvest geoduck clams
from the deep mud of the Sound just because the meat of their heads (which
resemble three to six foot long penises) sells for $50-200 a lb in Tokyo and
Peking), its rather glaring proof that the claims of all these western buddhists
that the eastern peoples are the wisest and most advanced civilization, etc. are
quite bogus..

Besides fish, there can be birds, even insects.

This is different, but what about superconductors?

Superconductors and superconductor technology can be used for many, many things.

How much does it really cost to do these kinds of things?

Oh great.  I finally get my kids to comprehend how a rock falling from space 
could wipe out all the dinosaurs.  Now I have to explain how farting is a 
danger to the planet?!?  Sheesh, guess that means we're going to have to cut 
way down on our garlic intake ;)

And to think of all the difficulty my parents went to to get my little brother
to stop farting at the dinner table...

[Non-member submission]

in quantum theory we must first assess the paradox of the photon. Does this
force-carrier exist in real time on the event horizon? Is the photon
traveling at sub-light speed or is it actually traveling at light speed?
How can this be measured? How do our eyes percieve light (photons)?  The
paradox that Einstein set forth is clear. Can physical entities exceed
light speed. I'll continue to say we have more galaxies to explore than the
milky way. It may be that we are afraid to contradict the experts but here
I am contadicting Einstein. The light speed barrier is a myth like the
sound barrier. What happens at super light speed is siumply that super
light speed no need to be afraid of moving backward in time because time
will naturally pass at light speed as with any other aspect of reality. No
quantum phsyics needed no atrophy, nothing. we simply must move into the
new understanding as when glen exceeded the sound barrier.

This is completely false. In fact, I read just a while ago that there is 
stunning evidence that dinosaurs may still be roaming the Earth today! Check

Con artists have fascinated me for many years, and as most of them are
physically attractive and socially charming I've enjoyed hanging out with
some of them from time to time.  I think in general it's true that a con
artist is only dangerous to a person who's looking to get something for
nothing, or anyhow for less than full value.  I was looking only for
entertainment from the con artists I hung out with, and none of them ever
ripped me off. In fact, the ones who took me into their confidence taught me
a few things about human nature, so I came away from the encounters with a
net gain.

The StockGeneration game was clearly a pyramid scheme. How could anyone
possibly look at the rules and not see that? It's not as though innocent
people had their fleeces shorn.

It's true that in big cities and big countries with lots of new cities to
start fresh in, and on the internet, con artists can bite the dust and
resurface with new identities and new scams.  The key to doing business in
an impresonal setting is first to look at what you're getting into.  If it's
clearly a get-rich-quick-and-easy scheme, be wary.  If it looks like a
legitimate business deal, start out small.  Don't quit your day job or
invest your life savings until the persons you're dealing with have
established a track record with you.

Hey, there's an opportunity for someone who wants to start an internet
business.

I guess theoretically the same thing could happen here.  In fact I
dont see why in theory a fish couldnt be whacked out of earth
orbit altogether given a sufficiently fast moving impacting

the same fate.  Bang ZOOM!  Right to the moon...  spike

Well, that was implicit in my irony, of course, but really I don't think
the Kennedys have been around nearly long enough. This is Cabots and Lodges
territory, no? (Speaking out of complete ignorance, you understand.)

Cabots?  Lodges?  Never heard of them.  In this century, unlike any
in the past, the *real* political power is no longer in the hands of any
politician, for the laws of the land are stable enough they cannot
change in any major way, even if we see that something clearly does
not work right.  No, the *real* power is in the hands of the
technocracy.  Ahhhh, nerdvana.  To hell with the meek, the smart have

No the planets are not in our solar system.  They are around
other stars within a couple of hundred light years.  I believe
we are up to 50 planets and either 2 or 3 planetary systems.
Lowest mass is slightly under Saturn (except maybe for those
orbiting around the pulsar).  Orbits are mostly fairly eliptical,
which to some extent is a selection effect (because large
Jupiters with orbits close to the star will be discovered
first in these surveys).  To get Jupiters close to stars,
you are likely to have had planetary billiards occuring
which is likely to create more elliptical orbits. I am
*hoping* as time goes by, we will get more circular orbits.
If that doesn't occur, then opportunities for life are
going to take a significant hit.

Good article in the Sept. 2000 Discover on how it may be raining
diamonds on Neptune That is the current theory on why it radiates
2.6x as much heat as it receives from the sun (rain induced friction).
*Or* you could think about it another way...  Lets see -- a very large
planet with the highest fraction of methane in its atmosphere.  What is
methane?  CH4...  Hmmmm.... Split that and you can make lots of
diamondoid thermonuclear reactors to burn the H in...  If the
heat isn't waste heat from the thermonuclear reactors of the
Neptune brain, and it *is* raining diamonds, God, what a waste...

Martin, if you have access to Excel and still want a spreadsheet of
more materials properties than you want to know, let me know
and I send you one.

I'm not a big fan of Gold's theories.  If I remember he argues
that the oil is deep, which means that it is going to be expensive
to extract.  EvMick is right in that there is a lot of underutilized
farmland out there, that *should* be growing synfuel or synplastic
so the U.S. can fix our balance of payments deficit.  And I would
call "permaculture" the greenhouses that are used when the return
justifies building the infrastructure.  In Seattle my winter/spring
vegetables come from hot houses in British Columbia.  In Moscow, I see
tons of flowers in the middle of winter.  I'm fairly sure they come from
greenhouses as well.  So Mike, if you get the price of gas up to
$5-$10/gallon, I'm sure you will see greenhouses sprouting up
all over the place or oil-apple orchids being planted.  The
fundamental problem with agriculture as currently practiced
is that much of it uses annual plants.  Erosion isn't as
much of a problem in orchids and your yields will be higher
because you don't have to regrow the much of the plant that
isn't used every year.

Brian, I'm currently off the list while attempting to
finish some of my work of the last several years, so I can
reorient myself to head in new directions this fall.
I still browse the archives from time to time, but am
not likely to see everything, if you have something
specific you think requires my attention, feel free to
cc: me.  Thanks for asking.

Actually, this sounds very much like a similar story reported in the L.A. 
Times or O.C. Register recently.  However, the gist of what I suspect to 
have been the original story was that the methane/water crystals that exist 
at the bottom of much of the ocean, in some cases in layers estimated to be 
hundreds of feet thick, started sublimating either as the ocean levels 
dropped during some mini-ice-age cycle due to a drop in the extreme pressure 
required to keep them in crystal form, or alternatively as the ocean temps 
rose during a hot cycle.  Either way, this process proceeded into a runaway 
global catastrophe which had the result you mentioned.

The methane crytals really are there, in vast abundance, but were only 
fairly recently identified as such, because it's hard to get them to the 
surface intact.  There has been a lot of speculation since their discovery 
that they might serve as a useful energy supply in the near future, 
comparable in total ergs to natural gas, but there is also the worry that 
the layers might not be all that stable...

Of course, an asteroid could also have been a triggering agent in a methane 
catatastrophe.  However, it seems unlikely to me that any such combination 
of events could have wiped out every single species of dinosaur.  I proposed 
a systemic cause that could account for the universal demise about twenty 
years ago, and have yet to hear a reason why it couldn't be true.

Methane hydrates were a complete surprise to me! I did a search on 
   methane crystal ocean
with google and got a slew of cool websites, including

Whew. Isn't there a story about some methane event (not sure if it's
methane hydrates or not)
with some lake, where evidence suggests that a sudden burp did seriously
bad things to the local ecology (a mass-die-off, IIRC)?

Hmm, better fire up google again...

Hmm, nope, the Web tells me that I'm thinking of Lake Nyos, and that was
C02, suddenly released when the lake overturned after prolonged
degassing of subsurface magma to the deepest parts of the lake.

This web thing can be pretty cool.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/feed/a52586-2000jan31.htm

is a nice article from the Washington Post on the effort to make Lake
Nyos safer, along with 
an amusing idea for getting electric power from the dissolved gas.  A
little bright spot in the middle (well, northwest) of Cameroon. :) 

I'll stop now.

Yup. I should.

A year ago someone contacted me with a note that they had linked our
Dust Group's web page to the Kansas song on this Music and Education
Web page:

(Search on "Dust in the Wind")

Personally, I like Mark Gingerich's "dusty" remake of "Wild Thing" by the
Troggs, in celebration of the Stardust spacecraft mission:


   WILD THING  (The Original)

   Wild thing...you make my heart sing...you make everything
   Groovy
   I said wild thing...

   Wild thing, I think I love you
   But I wanna know for sure
   Come on, hold me tight
   I love you

   (repeat chorus)

   Wild thing, I think you move me
   But I wanna know for sure
   So come on, hold me tight
   You move me



(Note: Comet Wild, pronounced "Vilt", is the Stardust spacecraft's
main target object)

    VILT THING  (The "dusty" remake)

    "Vilt" thing,
    We'll make your dust cling.
    You make this aerogel filthy.
    I said "Vilt" thing.

    "Vilt" thing, we think you're dusty.
    But we wanna know for sure.
    Are your particulates Brownlee?
    Oooh, you're dusty.

    "Vilt" thing,
    We'll make your dust cling.
    You make this aerogel filthy.
    I said "Vilt" thing.

    "Vilt" thing, we think you're icy.

             Perfected Brain Slice Cryopreservation now in Sight

   At the recent Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension Technologies
Dr. Greg Fahy presented current experimental results from the
Hippocampal Slice Cryopreservation Project (HSCP) of which he is chief
scientist and co-principal investigator. Now in its second year of
operation, the HSCP is being conducted at a research institution
associated with a major Southern California university by Yuri Pichugin
as experimentalist, and is funded by the Institute for Neural
Cryobiology (INC). Since that presentation, confirmation of those
results and additional progress have been made.

        The following research milestones have now been reached:

1.  Stable and reproducible experimental procedures have been perfected
for dissecting, handling & maintaining rat hippocampal slices with
minimal harm, for vitrification solution (VS) addition & removal, for
cooling, vitrification & rewarming, and for assaying cellular viability.
2.  Using a potassium/sodium ratio assay for cellular viability (cells
need to actively maintain this ratio in order to stay alive), addition &
removal of the VS currently used in the HSCP yields viabilities in the
range of about 50% of the viability of fresh, untreated control slices.
Slices vitrified in this VS have shown no injury attributable to
vitrification & warming per se in two separate experiments, and the
reproducible cellular viability of such vitrified hippocampal slices is
now at 53% of untreated controls.  The primary challenge, then, is to
reduce injury associated with the VS itself.
3.  Work is about to begin with a new VS which has allowed 21st Century
Medicine researchers to achieve 95% cellular viability after testing the
VS on rabbit kidney slices.  In addition, work is continuing on methods
of adding & removing VS that may be less damaging.  Finally, it is
possible that longer recovery times may further improve the ultimate
viability of the slices.  All in all, prospects for further improvement
appear excellent.

    The ultimate goal of the HSCP is perfected cryopreservation of brain
hippocampal slices. This requires not only high cellular viability, but
clear demonstration of functioning cellular interconnections. More
details about this advanced global viability assay may be found at the
INC website listed below.  Once high cellular viability is achieved
(which now looks to be very realistic before the end of the year 2000),
work will begin on that final clear demonstration.

    The many generous donors of over $100,000.00 spent so far to
support this project are to be commended for their judgment and
foresight. However, more money is now needed if the HSCP is to continue
its success and complete its original project goals, which now more than
ever before appear to be fully attainable.

    Please consider donating money to support the continuation of this
important work which in all likelihood will hasten the achievement of
perfected, fully-reversible, long-term human cryopreservation.

    INC is a registered California Public Benefit Corporation (501(c)(3)

    I would ask that EVERYONE consider giving to this project.  If you have 
questions than ask them.  If you want to know more about what motivated Ben 
Best to give so much money(when he is not wealthy) than send him an email.  
Or if you have technical questions reach out to Dr. Greg Fahy.  And this is 
a man known to be the premier researcher in the field of cryobiology.

    But afterward please make a donation of whatever you can.  This is a 
research program which should not be left to die before it bears its full 
fruit.  I hope I can count on all of you.

sincerely,

John

Another dissipating 'singularity' it seems.

Originally portrayed as a father-son event (see Warren Buffet & Bill Gates
in your favorite search engine), this election-year's powermonger festival
seems to be shaping up as a Gates-Allen duel. Perhaps this is most evident
in the State of Washington, where the Lakeside alumni are quite successfully
bred. Allen's 'failed' Common's venture seeded his growing culture of
real-estate holdings in the Seattle area. Combine this with the Seahawks and
Experience Music Project(EMP) and you will get dizzy trying to distill his
diversified strategies into a cohesive plan. Top this with his recent $11M
to SETI for The Allen Array and what have you got?

Compare this to Gate's 'altruistic' giving to vaccinate the entire
third-world population, college-funding for minorities, and matching grant
for low-income housing for families with children.

Can "Allen takes on Gates" be far behind "Bush takes on Gore" ???

I really liked this final line he wrote:

There is a tech billioniare whose name eludes me(not Gates) who has said as an engineer it bothered him that the business suits and lawyers seemed to parasitically prosper off the work of his fellow engineers and scientists.  

He said he just knew if he could combine his technical knowledge with the right business skills he could turn the tables.  And he did.

He had been an engineering professor who took something he developed to market.  He had experienced a bad marriage and a midlife crisis and decided he had to do something to make his life standout.

This man comes from a poor background and joined the navy where his technical skills were first discovered and encouraged.  I can't remember the name though...  Any ideas?

The planets currently being found -- if that's what they indeed are -- and
their orbits appear to radically different from what scientists expected
other solar systems to be like.  Though not doubt this is due to a sampling
error -- researchers are limited, for now, to finding planets in certain
ways which bias the research toward finding large planets in eccentric
orbits because these are the easiest to find -- I don't think anyone in the
1970s or 1980s would have predicted these particular types of orbits would
have been found at all.

What I'm leading up to here is the question of whether what has been found
is typical.  Also, I'd like to know how these findings have affected
theories of planetary formation and of solar system formatiom.  (My
knowledge of such is mostly limited to reading some of the popular
scientific publications (e.g., _American Scientist_) and some of the bigger
journals (e.g., _Nature_).)  Have workers in these areas had to revise their
theories in light of the data?

ct,

thanks for the great link.  I really enjoyed the article even though the last time I visited Seattle I was eleven.  I will oneday have to visit it again.  

Here in Anchorage we have what are known as "oil companies" who tend to stingily donate money for their own p.r. desires.  Though they do spend a ton of money on tv commercials saying how great they are for the state and community.  I wish they would donate that money to a good cause and spare me the nauseous propoganda.

best wishes,

John

Has anyone seen on the net the character sheet for Bill Gates as a Dungeons and Dragons character?  It is hilarious(for gamers at least)!  His alignment(character) was chaotic evil!!

Actually, both Gore and Bush are of the type, though Bush did have his
period of hanging out with the proles during his wildcatting days in
west Texas, which is where he gets much of his 'aw shucks' persona
(outside of that from his mother). Gore's famous rigidity is classic
Southern blueblood gentleman.

And Rockefellers, and Vanderbilts, etc. Kennedys are political
bluebloods (which doesn't take long to do), but definitely are 'johnny
come  latelys' to the big money scene, and are considered little more
than legitimized mobsters by old money families (old Joe made his bucks
rumrunning during Prohibition, while his father-in-law, 'Honey Fitz'
Fitzgerald (Rose Kennedy's dad), was a famously corrupt Boston Mayor).

Spike, that is SOOOOOO cute. Precious. Who do you think made all the
real money off of those IPOs??? All the old money families have
priviledged positions at major stock brokerages, and their trusts get
first pick of any IPO stocks that come out, as well as being typically
pre-IPO investors as well.

My idea here was to use generated sonic environment cues to effect pressure.  An
alternative might be the use of focussed radio waves.  The way I see it is that
these produce cavitation in the areas of existing gas or liquid flow, or otherwise
generally just do what it can.  It's a pretty broad concept.

Since we've discussed GM food crops on the list lately, I thought some of
you might be interested in seeing how it's done.  Here's a cool site on
wheat transformation that goes step-by-step through the process of
developing herbicide resistant wheat.  It includes photographs of each step.

Okay, so my ignorance is not as complete about American local history as an
American's. :)

The Cabots, Lodges and Lowells are among the famous Boston Brahmin Yankee
old money lineage that dates back to the Puritans, if I'm not mistaken. The
Kennedys, by contrast, represented new money (not to say corrupt bootlegger
money) and crass Irish power, disdained by the Brahmins. E.g.:

http://omega.cc.umb.edu/~irish/boston_irish.htm

< Boston did not welcome Irish Catholics, though the city required their
labors. In turn, Irish Catholics battled
Yankee-Brahmin Boston, though the immigrants adopted New England values. If
Boston's first families reminded the Irish immigrant of their former
Anglo-Irish landlords, the Boston Lowells, Cabots and Lodges also served as
their models of American propriety and achievement. As though both groups
were trapped on an island, rather than crowded onto a peninsula, the
Yankee-Celt encounter grew into a grudging marriage of convenience, driven
by necessity, often acrimonious, but also not without respect, even love. >

The Bostonian establishment noted in a famous phrase that the Cabots spoke
only to the Lodges, and the Lodges only to God. These Brahmins include the
same Lowells who produced the great 20th century poet Robert Lowell, who
created one of the most well-known of all American poems "For the Union
Dead" for the 1960 Boston Arts Festival, and Percival Lowell who much
earlier invented the canals of Mars. Or so I gather, but then what would an
Aussie know about big city living?

He's a Californian, a place that is much like its own planet, where they think
anything more than 50 years old is ancient history. Round these parts (NH), if
your house isn't over 150 years old and if you family hasn't been here for at
LEAST three or four generations, you are a transplant. The Cabots, Lodges,
Rockefellers, and Vanderbilts still play down the road a piece in Woodstock, VT
in the summertime.

Actually, the Lowell's money dates back to the industrialization of Lowell,
Massachusetts, which is where the US industrial revolution started... to the
Cabots and Lodges, they were considered new money... ;) Having been born in
Lowell, and gone to school there up till 3rd grade, thats one of the things you
learn in school...

So it seems that the process does still use some natural selection methods to
weed out successfully transformed plants from untransformed plants: "Following
acclimation the plants
are screened for herbicide resistance by spraying with the selective herbicide.
With current
procedures only 10-20% of the plants are actually transgenic. (Unaffected by the
herbicide.)" In this respect, this is little different from natural selection of
naturally mutated species.

Man, the funny things you learn. just think, if Bohr had put it in layman's

I seem to recall a newspaper article a few years back, that was talking 
about how all the grazing cattle
in the farmlands of the US and Europe could be a significant factor in the 
greenhouse effect from methane flatulence.
I laughed it off then, but if this new, very well researched study by the 
Chinese says the dinosaurs killed
themselves that way, then maybe we should go kill all the cattle, and save 
our planet!!!

[Non-member submission]

Been slow at reading these postings so I hope I'm not being redundant.
Ignoring the error which has already been pointed out, I think this is
erred in truth.  Two years ago in my astronomy class, we watched a flick
on attempts to discover other planets.  The first guy had made a mistake,
but two Russian astronomers had discovered a planet circling about as
close to a pulse star (I know there's a proper name for this) as Venus, in
a very rapid orbit.  It was slightly smaller than Jupiter but on a close
order of magnitude.  The star was Epsilon something...sounds too close to
not be the same thing.  So if true, why are they claiming to just have
found it.

Spose one way to check would be to find out what type of star Epsilon
Erdani is.  Does anyone know?

How prophetic that just a week or two ago I watched a Stossel show on
"What Has Happened To Free Speech In America". IMO he has pointed to a
kind of "administrative fascism" under the guise of a democratic system
and that is why they must stop him. This whole code of "Totem and Taboo in
America" has gone too far and is destroying lives and careers. Isn't it
time for Congress to conduct an investigation, starting with Stossel's
program on the kind of tyranny against free speech which is being fostered
especially by petty despots in academia? Let's start by examining those
free speech codes on campuses. And let's not stop with the letter of those
codes. Are they being SELECTIVELY enforced to the benefit of some and the
detriment of others to add to the injustice which they perpetrate?

This story (although of interest) is about quantum dots, not quantum
computing.  Holding a bit in a quantum dot does not make it a coherent
superposition of quantum states. (see:

This is tonight, BTW.  Should be interesting to see how much Stossel is
forced to retract.  The organic food people are also claiming that Stossel
said that organic chicken was contaminated with E. Coli, without checking
to see if it was a harmful strain or one of the many harmless ones.

Stossel got in trouble a few weeks ago with Erin Brokovich, the real
person behind the movie based on her story.  She had famously pushed
forward a legal case about contaminated water that eventually led to
a large settlement.  Stossel claimed that the contaminant was actually
not known to cause cancer when ingested in water, and furthermore that
statistically the incidence of cancer among local residents was no higher
than average.  Brokovich came back with an invitation to Stossel to have
his family drink similarly contaminated water.  He declined but said,
let's not scare people unnecessarily.

Personally I don't feel a knee-jerk impulse to defend this guy just
because he may share some of my political views.  IMO he should be very
careful about making claims, especially when they contradict expectations.
If you're saying that grocery store produce has no pesticide residues,
you ought to make sure of your facts.  Anyone who rinses an apple before
eating is going to be skeptical about this.  By going out with false
information, he damages his own cause, which means he damages my causes.

Next time John Stossel says that GM food is safe, or that people can
use drugs responsibly, or that gun control raises crime rates, people
are going to wonder: is this another pesticide coverup?  Can Stossel
really be trusted?  Everything he says is going to be questioned.

I don't think ABC will fire him; the controversy will be good for ratings.
I'll probably watch 20/20 tonight even though I detest the weepy stories
they often present.  But even if a bunch of libertarians descend on the
message boards to rally round the cause, it's not going to help Stossel's
credibility in the long run.

Yeah, but they misspelled "Mordenkainen" as "Mordekainen", and that
ruined the whole experience for me.

I think folks like Zubrin can't allow themselves to think too clearly about 
the impact of mature nanotech on space technology because, if they do, 
they'll risk a kind of paralysis in their current advocacy activities.  If 
one clearly sees what will be possible in no more than 50 years, it's hard to 
advocate the kind of programs folks like Zubrin work for.

Well, it's not "quantum computing" in the sense of superposition, but it is 
computing that makes use of quantum effects.. Thus, in my book, it's 
quantum computing.

For those interested in reading this without proprietary MS software:
Something like

$ <world.doc tr -d \\0 | tr '\r\205\222\223\224\226' '\n.'\''""-' | fmt | less

extracts the text quite readable, apart from some easily ignored
crap at the beginning and end.

Since volcanic activity was so great, perhaps there was so much methane in the
atmosphere, that all it took was a sufficiently large match, like a gigantic
volcanic eruption or a meteorite strike that set the atmosphere on fire.  Of
course this could be the silliest idea ever.

Roger that.  Of course, there are more opportunities now to
generate new money than ever before, and the new money
is bigger than the old money.  Has this ever happened before
in history?  When else in history has the little guy with brains

It's fun to plat the what if game, one of my favorites also involves the history
of the A bomb. In 1939 Hahn and Strassman bombarded uranium with neutrons
and produced barium, this proved that the uranium was undergoing fission, and
much more important, it proved that an Atomic Bomb was not only possible but
practical, all you needed was money and engineering. By 1939 Hitler was only
expecting a short war, making a bomb would take a long time, too long he thought
to make a difference so he didn't make much effort toward developing it.

However in fascist Italy in 1934 Enrico Fermi performed almost the exact
same experiment that Hahn and Strassman did in 1939, and although he
must have produced fission, for some reason he did not detect it. This was
very uncharacteristic of Fermi, not only was he a superb theoretician he was
probably the best experimental physicist of his age, the man made very
few mistakes. Years later Fermi said he was very glad he did make a mistake
this time, if the Axis powers had started to make a bomb in 1934 the world
would be in a new dark age today. Fermi also had personal reasons for doing
less than his best, his wife was Jewish.

their brains in a basket.  Actually the French Revolutionaries whacked off

It's not cattle...it's whales.  Stands to reason doesn't it?  Imagine the
volumne of a whale-fart!!!!  The lonely but heroic Japanese recognized that
problem years ago and set about..(aided by the Soviets...and a few
individualists out of Nantucket)....to save the Planet.

Alas...uninformed media coverage turned Public Opinion against them...thus
endangering the very existence of the world's ecology.

The other day I read on James P. Hogan's Bulletin Board that Venus radiated

SATURN'S RACE

I've recently finished reading the recent hardcover release of "Saturn's
Race"....a colaboration  by two of my favorite authors....Niven and Barnes.

The story is set in the very near future (2010 or so?).  Human
Augmentation....neural interfaces..life extention....global population
concerns ....and interestingly enough many of the themes from the Millenium
Project are explored. (floating islands made of sea-crete and OTEC power
generation)


THE DYING LIGHT: Evergence

This is the second of a trilogy...I missed the first one.  The authors are
Williams and Dix from Australia.

The time frame is waaaaaaaaaaaaay in the future....a quarter of a million
years or so.  Many transhuman topics are mentioned such as trancendence
(High Humans), nanotech (albiet breifly) and Sentient Artificial
Intelligence.

I was very interested in the tech...but to be brutally honest I thought the
story telling was a little lame....but I think I'm gonna get the first one
(Prodigal Sun) anyway...<it wasn't THAT bad>

EvMick
Bloomington Ill

As always Niven and Barnes write a good yard....I spent several enjoyable
hours reading it.

Recommended.

I think the Dungeons and Dragons books were developed to help prepare young people to prepare for careers as lawyers.  Talk about monolithic and sometimes contradictory volumes!

Is this that Hogan guy who buys into Velikovsky's BS? According to Foggs
_Terraforming: Engineering Terrestrial Environments_ Venus reflect 70%
of the liht hitting it, with, as I recall 90% of the remainder being
retained by the greenhouse system there. I'll go dig up the book outta
my Jeep and get some better data...

Now, any excess heat a planet radiates above that which it receives from
the sun is obviously a result of it turning its angular velocity to heat
through vulcanism in Venus's case (it doesn't have much angular
velocity, having a retrograde day of some 240 earth days) and through
convection in the case of Neptune. Unless you think there are Helium3
people living on Neptune fusing hydrogen for energy...

One of their most interesting goals to me is this one: "Libertarian
Outreach: We hope to help out in the current drought of libertarian ideas on
college campuses and in popular culture."

I think there's an even greater drought on highschool campuses.

I've corresponded (via email) with several highschool students from the US
and Canada who are aware that the options presented to them in their
classrooms are more limited than necessary, but they don't know where to
turn for more inspiring guidance.  I've thought of trying to do some sort of
interactive web site for these people (with the input of my 16 year old
daughter, my 17 year old nephew, and their friends).

I'd welcome any suggestions on content.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE AUGUST 11 2000

IN THIS ISSUE:  LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE AUGUST 2000 ISSUE NOW ONLINE:
Antioxidants under attack; LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Human growth

Crohn's disease;  PROTOCOL:  Crohn's disease;  PRODUCT OF THE WEEK:

LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE AUGUST 2000 ISSUE
Antioxidants under attack

Consumers of vitamin supplements have been hit with a lot of negative
press lately, and The Life Extension Foundation has been on the forefront
in evaluating whether these anti-supplement reports have scientific merit.

On April 10, 2000, the National Academy of Sciences issued a press release
that stated:
"Insufficient evidence exists to support claims that taking megadoses of
dietary antioxidants, such as selenium and vitamins C and E, or
carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can prevent chronic diseases."
This report received widespread media attention, and many news articles
questioned the value of dietary supplements altogether. The National
Academy of Sciences' press release was based on the conclusions of a
512-page book that ostensibly looked at all the published scientific
literature about the intake of certain nutrients and subsequent risk of
developing disease.

The name of this 512-page book is Dietary Reference Intakes For Vitamin C,
Vitamin E, Selenium and the Carotenoids. This book contains a startling
contradiction. The negative conclusions drawn by the authors are opposite
to the positive findings about the supplements that are described in the
very same book. This contradiction is not surprising, considering that the
book is authored by two "committees" comprised of 40 members.

The book omits published studies about antioxidants. It also fails to take
into account that supplement takers usually consume a wide variety of
nutrients to protect their health, not just vitamin C or E alone.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2858/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html


LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSVIE:  Human growth hormone helps Crohn's
disease patients

In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers
evaluated the effect of the administration of human growth hormone on
thirty-seven patients with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease.
Patients self-injected either a placebo or 5 mg growth hormone for the
first week of the study, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day.
The study partcipants were instructed to consume least two grams of
protein per kilogram body weight on a daily basis. Patients continued
their other medications.  The participants scored the severity of eight
different symptoms at the beginning and throughout the study on the
Crohn's Disease Activity Index.   Higher scores correlated with greater
severity of symptoms.   After one month, the patients who received the
growth hormone had a greater decrease in scores than the placebo group.
This improvement continued and was greater after four months at the
conclusion of the study.  The only side effects observed in this group
were edema and headache, which usually resolved within the first month.

Also observed at the end of the study was the ability of those who
received growth hormone to discontinue over half of the drugs previously
found to be necessary.  By contrast, the placebo group increased their
drug intake by 4%.  At the end of the four months, half of the patients
who received growth hormone and who still required medication were able to
reduce their medication dose.

The authors of the study concluded that a large multicenter study should
be conducted to confirm these results, which preliminarily indicate that
growth hormone may be of help to people with Crohn's disease.


WHAT'S HOT
Bacteria suspect in Crohns's disease

The July issue of the journal Gastroenterology reported on the discovery
by researchers at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, of
evidence of a bacteria in the affected areas of Crohn's disease. Crohn's
disease is an incurable, chronic intestinal disorder, in which sufferers
develop a weak and inflamed gastrointestinal tract, which causes severe
abdominal pain and diarrhea. This leads to many related complications and
increases the risk of colorectal cancer. The cause of Crohn's is unknown,
but the disease has been believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which
the body attacks itself.
The researchers in this report examined intestinal lesions from 212
patients. They analyzed lesions caused by the disease and compared them to
other intestinal mucosal tissue. A specific bacterial genetic sequence was
present in 43% of the Crohn's lesions compared to being found in 5% of
specimens derived from patients with noninflammatory bowel disease lesions
and 9% of ulcerative colitis specimens. Antibodies to the sequence were
also much higher in the serum of Crohn's disease patients than in other
patients examined.

The method used in the study looked for DNA segments from a microorgansim
found in Crohn's patients, but the researchers as yet have not identified
the bacteria. It is possible that it is one that is well known, or it
could be a new discovery. It is not known yet whether this bacteria is the
cause of disease, but researchers hope to pinpoint its identity so that
therapies can be developed that will target it.

This research indicates that the body's immune response to a microorgansim
could be the culprit in Crohn's. In the same issue of Gastroenterology, Dr
Charles O Elson commented, "It seems likely that many antigens and
microorganisms will be involved in stimulating the inflammation."
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2859/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

PROTOCOL
Crohn's disease

Crohn's disease is a chronic disorder of the intestines. Of unknown
etiology, the gastrointestinal tract in persons suffering from this
disease becomes inflamed and weak, making digestion difficult and leading
to general physical debility.  The symptoms are similar to ulcerative
colitis, and they are both categorized as inflammatory bowel diseases; to
distinguish between them, your doctor may need to examine a sample of
intestinal tissue.

Crohn's disease can attack any part of your intestines from the mouth to
the anus, but most commonly it strikes the ileum (lower portion of the
small intestine) or the colon (large intestine). Ulcers form on the inner
intestinal lining and eventually spread through the intestinal wall. As
the affected part of the intestine becomes scarred and thick, the passage
narrows, disrupting nutrient absorption and normal bowel function.

A 1998 German study examined deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements
in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The records from 392
outpatients-279 with Crohn's disease and 113 with ulcerative colitis-were
analyzed. Deficiencies were found in 85% of patients with Crohn's disease,
predominantly deficiencies of iron and calcium. Less frequently,
deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found.
Given this broad cross section of deficiencies, a basic multivitamin
nutrient supplement may be helpful to stave off secondary weakness and
complications from such deficiencies. Note that calcium deficiency, in
particular, carries with it a risk of osteoporosis.

A published Scandinavian study suggests that fiber, starches, glutamine,
and fish oils may all help Crohn's patients with issues of malnutrition.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2860/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
L-glutamine

L-glutamine is an amino acid which can be used for energy in the brain. It
is recommended for alcoholism, hypoglycemia and fatigue. L-glutamine is
used by athletes to improve exercise endurance.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2861/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

For more information about glutamine see Life Extension Magazine September
1999:
"Glutamine:  The essential nonessential amino acid".

Glutamine is classified as a "nonessential amino acid." This label may
mislead some people into believing that we don't need it. But, in essence,
"nonessential" means only that the body can synthesize this amino acid. It
does not mean "unimportant."

In fact, glutamine is of crucial importance; we are lucky that we do not
have to depend totally on dietary sources. It seems that every cell in the
body uses glutamine. Some tissue types, however, depend on glutamine much
more than others.

other life extension topics.

Yeah. Who wants to bet that the aforementioned university will already
have many millions of research dollars coming from the feds, so they
would have an incentive to come up with the 'right' answers...???

Carnivore is gonna get toasted if it gets an impartial review. Just on
the fact it sifts through all email going through the server it is quite
unconstitutional...

The site says that this all came down on 2000 July 30.  I did not hear
anything about it in the news, so it's a very small sign...

In the early 1990s in Perth Amboy, NJ, several people and I signed a
document declaring our stance against regulations and taxation and for free
markets and it only made a local splash -- probably, mostly, because we knew
some people who worked for the local papers AND we also published a
newsletter, _Laissez-nous faire!_, that was distributed locally.  Needless
to say, not much ever came of it.  Taxes and regulations continued and even
increased...

However in fascist Italy in 1934 Enrico Fermi performed almost the exact
same experiment that Hahn and Strassman did in 1939, and although he
must have produced fission, for some reason he did not detect it. This was
very uncharacteristic of Fermi, not only was he a superb theoretician he was
probably the best experimental physicist of his age, the man made very
few mistakes. Years later Fermi said he was very glad he did make a mistake
this time, if the Axis powers had started to make a bomb in 1934 the world
would be in a new dark age today. Fermi also had personal reasons for doing
less than his best, his wife was Jewish.


Exactly. Noddack (1934) first suggested the uranium fission.
Hahn and Meittner, Joliot, etc. found nothing. Edoardo Amaldi and
Emilio Segré (and also Enrico Fermi) performed their experiments in Rome,
during 1934 and 1936, with neutrons. Segré said they did not understand
those results because that search (trans-uranium elements)
was extremely chaotic (the s.c. multi-radioactivity).
Also Abelson (1938) at Berkeley did not realize that one of his X-rays
pictures
showed clearly the fission. Then Hahn and Strassman during the same year....

Bohr was very interested in that field. In Los Alamos Bohr said
he had a meeting (in London) with W. Churchill about the possibility of
making the A-bomb in G.B. But his speech was obscure ... and Churchill
was in a great hurry.

Fermi (Segrè and many many others) worked in Los Alamos

Biotech Research Branches Out
By Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, August 3, 2000; Page A01
In an orchard in western Canada, genetically enhanced fruit trees kill
insects on contact without pesticide sprays. Soon they will bear apples
whose crispy white flesh won't turn brown even hours after being cut.
In Israel, poplar trees have been made to grow so fast that they could
eliminate the need to log old-growth forests, while gobbling enough carbon
dioxide to help slow global warming.
In North Carolina and Minnesota, experimental trees containing novel woody
fibers can be digested into pulp without the tons of toxic chemicals that
today poison the rivers around paper mills.
These dream trees and others with equally attractive traits are growing on
scores of test plots around the world, part of a little-noted biotech
revolution in forestry that experts predict will hit its commercial stride
in the next five years.
Building on a decade of practice in crops such as soybeans and cotton,
researchers at universities and at a few biotechnology companies have been
perfecting the art of injecting novel genes into the cells of trees. Now,
scientists say, they are poised to harness the enormous economic potential
of the biggest, longest-lived and most biologically productive land plants
on Earth.
Yet for all the promise that foresters see in the newly dawning era of
genetically engineered trees, others see an ecological crisis in the making.
Trees can live hundreds of times longer than the biotech food crops already
on the market, critics note. That makes it difficult to predict the
long-term impact of genetically altered trees on the countless species that
depend on them, including the soil-dwelling fungi and microbes that are the
foundation of the planet's terrestrial food chain.
Opponents fear that biotech trees, to which scientists have added genes
from bacteria, chickens and even humans, will provide poor habitats for
beneficial insects and birds, transforming biologically diverse woodlands
into sterile "Frankenforests."
They also warn that genes conferring resistance to leaf-chewing pests and
chemical herbicides, which researchers are adding to tree DNA, may spread
via windblown pollen to related tree species, creating woody weeds with
unnatural advantages over their ancient cousins.
The emerging debate over genetically modified trees echoes the one already
plaguing biotech agriculture, but with added scientific concerns unique to
trees. The issue also strikes an emotional chord not engendered by
genetically altered farm crops because it focuses on some of the most
beloved and majestic life forms on Earth.
The stakes in the looming battle over biotech trees are high. Wood products
amount to a $400 billion global industry, and the demand for paper and pulp
products is expected to increase by 50 percent in the next two decades,
exceeding supplies by 2010. At the same time there is growing pressure to
save the world's remaining forests for wilderness and recreational purposes.
That fundamental conflict between consumption and conservation has both
sides of the molecular forestry debate waving environmental banners.
Proponents say biotech trees offer the only way to increase the production
of lumber, paper and other wood products without decimating existing
forests and exacerbating global warming.
"For every tree farm that produces twice the usual amount of wood on an
acre of land you can leave an acre of natural forest alone," said Ron
Sederoff, director of the forest biotechnology group at North Carolina
State University.
Increasing Production
In the past decade, about 130 outdoor tests of genetically modified trees
have gotten the go-ahead from the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which has primary responsibility for
regulating bioengineered trees in this country--more than half of them in
the past 2 1/2 years. The first applications for permission to grow large
commercial tracts of the new trees are expected to come around 2005.
Dozens of additional outdoor tests are underway in at least 16 countries,
notably Chile, Uruguay and Indonesia, according to the World Wide Fund of
Britain, an environmental group that has called for tighter regulation of
tree engineering and a global moratorium on commercial releases.
In many cases, it's impossible to say exactly what scientists are putting
into the trees. Although APHIS's Web site summarizes every application for
field tests, many say simply "CBI," for "confidential business
information," in the column that is supposed to describe which gene is
being studied and which organism it came from.
But available government records and interviews with scientists indicate
that research is largely focused on aspens and cottonwoods, both members of
the poplar family, which are favorites of the paper and pulp industry. Of
particular interest are genes that reduce the amount of a substance called
lignin, or that weaken lignin's chemical structure. Lignin is the tough
arboreal "connective tissue" that today must be chemically degraded at
enormous expense in the process of turning trees into paper.
Researchers also are adding genes that spur faster growth and increase the
concentration of cellulose, the ingredient of prime commercial value in
trees. "The idea is to change the tree's genetic regulation to put more
available light energy into cellulose production," said Michael Moynihan of
InterLink Biotechnologies LLC in Princeton, N.J., which is part of a
Chilean biotechnology concern.
And scientists are learning how to block the growth of flowers, pine cones
and seeds in trees to focus more of the plants' energy on wood fiber
production and to keep novel packets of DNA from spreading to other
trees--a concern not only of environmentalists but also of corporate patent
lawyers who don't want to lose control of their proprietary genes.
Fast-growing forest trees could do more than increase the world's supply of
lumber and pulp. They might also help reduce global warming.
Through photosynthesis, trees consume large amounts of carbon dioxide
(CO2), a greenhouse gas produced by automobiles and other industrial
sources whose emissions the world's countries have pledged to reduce under
the terms of the pending Kyoto Protocol.
Amid growing uncertainty that the signers of that accord will be able to
achieve its goals, there is talk of creating a system of "carbon credits"
that might allow countries with many CO2-gulping forests to sell their
excess air-scrubbing capacity to nations falling short of their clean-air
goals. The approach is supported by some in the oil and automotive
industries, including Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., which has its own forest
biotechnology program.
"Our laboratories are working to develop strains of trees that are
especially efficient at photosynthesis," states a Toyota summary of the
company's efforts. Once those carbon-consuming trees are developed, the
company explains, "we can clone thousands more exactly the same.
Eventually, while paying close attention to the ecological balance, we hope
to have whole forests of these extra-efficient trees, to help purify the
atmosphere."
Other genetically modified trees may help clean up contaminated land. The
one tree listed by APHIS as having been endowed with a human gene is a
poplar with a stretch of human DNA that can break up cancer-causing dioxins
and the toxic breakdown products of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
Bearing Fruit?
Orchard growers have their own reasons for tinkering with genes, and APHIS
has approved field trials of more than 50 genetically altered variants of
apples, grapefruits, pears, persimmons, plums and walnuts in 18 states,
most on small sites of an acre or two.
USDA scientists, for example, recently created a plum containing viral DNA
that makes the fruit resistant to plum pox, a fruit-deforming disease that
has cost growers millions of dollars in Europe and arrived in the United
States last fall. "The trees essentially vaccinate themselves," said Ralph
Scorza, who led the work in West Virginia at a location he keeps secret
because of fears that protesters will damage the site.
Another priority is the creation of patented specialty fruits with improved
flavors or other consumer-friendly traits.
"Everyone recognizes that the money in the tree fruit industry of the
future is going to come from new varieties with exclusive rights," said
Neal Carter, president of Okanagan Biotechnology of Summerland, B.C. Carter
has planted about 800 genetically altered trees, the oldest of which are
just a year short of fruit-bearing age.
Next fall, with great anticipation, Carter will cut into the first of his
genetically altered apples endowed with DNA to block the chemical reaction
that makes the flesh turn brown after the fruit is bitten or cut. If the
gene works, he said, "you'll be able to cut this apple up and put it in the
lunch bag and the kid might actually eat it."
Among the other new fruits Carter foresees coming to market in the next
decade are peaches engineered to ripen more slowly and deliciously after
harvest and cherries in a variety of fashionable new colors.
That's assuming, he adds, that the research is allowed to move forward.
In fact, advocates opposed to biotech trees are becoming increasingly vocal
and active. In March, the Boston-based Native Forest Network, the
Rainforest Action Network of San Francisco and a Uruguayan ecology group
launched an international public relations campaign against genetically
engineered trees. Other activists have conducted nighttime raids on tree
test plots in the United States, Canada and Europe, destroying years of
work and contributing to the decision by at least one corporation to drop
its efforts.
Zeneca Plant Science, a major European biotechnology concern, recently
abandoned its foray into biotech forestry, saying it became disenchanted
after protesters ruined its sole stand of trees last summer. St.
Louis-based Monsanto and Royal Dutch Shell also quit the field in the past
two years, citing unspecified "business" considerations.
"The main risk of working with engineered trees is not a biological risk,
it's a political risk because of the hysteria around the world," said
Steven Strauss, who is developing genetically modified trees at Oregon
State University in Corvallis.
Like the conflict over genetically altered crops, the war of words over
genetically altered trees tends to be extremely polarized. Opponents warn
of irreversible genetic pollution, while proponents claim that new traits
are unlikely to persist in the wild.
Nonetheless, even biotech-friendly foresters agree that some concerns
cannot just be waved away.
Some suspect, for example, that low-lignin trees may prove especially
vulnerable to insect infestation, which could harm surrounding forests. And
if low-lignin genes do spread, then surrounding trees might degrade faster
than usual and deprive many species of the crucial habitat now afforded by
slowly rotting wood.
Opponents also predict that plantations of fast-growing trees will require
large amounts of water, fertilizer and pesticides, undercutting their
usefulness as a hedge against global warming. They're asking whether
genetically altered trees will cause allergies in people not usually
bothered by tree pollen. And they wonder what will happen to the birds,
insects and other wildlife that depend on tree pollen, nectar and seeds if
scientists plant large expanses of sterile trees whose reproductive
energies have been diverted to fuel extra growth.
Assessing the Risks
Ultimately, questions about safety will have to be resolved by data, not
debate. But opponents say regulatory standards are not tough enough.
The restrictions on outdoor testing of genetically modified trees are
virtually identical to those already in place for annual crops, they note.
In most cases, growers must simply sign a statement promising they will
follow general guidelines to protect the environment.
"The current rules are not very stringent and are not well policed, and
there are a lot of different risk issues that ought to be addressed
thoroughly before these trees get commercialized," said Jane Rissler of the
Union of Concerned Scientists.
Unfortunately, federal funding of experiments to assess risks of engineered
trees is scant, said Dave Ellis, who conducted seminal work on genetically
altered spruce trees at the University of Wisconsin and is now at CellFor
Inc., a biotech tree company in Victoria, B.C. Ellis tried several times to
get federal money for ecological studies of low-lignin wood while he was at
Wisconsin, he said, but to no avail.
Federal regulators say they are on top of the issue.
"USDA recognizes that there are environmental, scientific and other issues
that need to be carefully considered and addressed before genetically
engineered trees are used commercially," said Michael Schechtman, the
agency's biotechnology coordinator. When the USDA receives its first
request for commercial approval of a biotech tree, he said, it will be
considered "in an open and public process."
The department may also soon ask a special committee of the National
Academy of Sciences to investigate the risks and benefits of biotech trees.
And biotech foods such as fruits and nuts will have to pass additional
muster with the Food and Drug Administration, Schechtman said--and with the
Environmental Protection Agency if they contain any insect-killing genes.
If activists have their way, that will be a long process.
But every year of delay can only hurt what's left of Earth's remaining
forests, said Kenneth Munson of ArborGen in Savannah, Ga., a biotech tree
venture that includes woodland-product giants International Paper and
Westvaco and two New Zealand companies.
"We have great confidence in the American people," Munson said. "We think
they are knowledgeable and pragmatic and we look forward to a rational
discussion of this."

What kind of animals should we send to space?  There is not much air.  The animals
take about as much biomass as humans do, or rather, they can be compared.  Anaerobic
bacteria can probably grow in places without air if the other materials are present.

Will Russia still land on Mars in 2030?  Before?  When was there last time of
actually sending people to Mars?

I think a lot of animals and people can move to space.

About the superconductor, perhaps you could use it as a laminate on train rails to
allow dual use of the rails by regular diesel or electric trains by trains that are
levitated barely above the rails, with the wheels kept to speed.

There are many, many applications of superconductors.

Since the Dem's are kind enough to hold their bash in my backyard, I figure 
I'll break out the rollerblades and vidcam to capture all the antics out on 
the street.  What with all the protests, counter-protests, demonstrations 
and counter-demonstrations, and the LAPD not knowing how the hell to handle 
the situation, it promises to be fun for the whole family.

If I happen to capture anything compelling, I'll throw up a website and post 
it all there.

It's funny watching all the various groups getting ready for this fiasco.  
What happened to the "good old" days when issues were compelling enough to 
inspire folks to almost spontaneously show up and demonstrate?

Now protests are run just like political campaigns, with the media-savvy 
protestors putting the correct political spin on the before and after media 
commentary.  They all have phalanxes of lawyers, consultants and even give 
pre-protest training classes.  So while the cops are taking classes on how 
to deal with the demonstrators, the protestors are taking classes down the 
block on how to deal with the cops.  Somehow, it all seems so...sterile.

Anyhow, stay tuned.  If I don't get arrested, or beaten too badly.  I'll 
give you the low down on all the antics.

An Extropian Manifesto

by Michael Lorrey

Given the Extropian Principles, and that there now exists in the media,
government, politics, and public demonstration and acts of sabotage 
that are opposed to and seek the end of the liberty of the individual 
to follow the Extropian Principles, we find that the time has come 
for the supporters of Extropy everywhere to stand up and be counted in
their demands for the new century. Namely:

Government is Obsolete: Centralized founts of authority, controlled 
by individuals who corrupt, and are corrupted by the centralization 
of power, are anathema to the principles of Self Improvement and 
Spontaneous Order. Perpetuation of government bureaucracies, the 
confiscation of private property, the imposition of force upon 
individuals to prevent them from engaging in victimless activities,
restraints upon individual use of technology, and the protection and
subsidy of priviledged corporate entities which dominate their 
markets with the support and aid of government agents and regulations
all restrain the liberty of the individual and the advancement of the
human spirit, body, and mind from reaching new levels of 
civilization, expression, and intellect.

Taxation is Slavery: The involuntary confiscation of the property and 
productive output of the individual, to the point that currently half
of an individuals output is now claimed by the government is slavery.
Part time slavery under the heel of government is no less morally 
repugnant than full time slavery under the heel of other individuals.
We refuse to be enslaved any longer.

Civil Confiscation is Pillagry: The confiscation of the entirety of 
one's private property, home, means of transportation, self protection,
or production by government agencies establishes modern government 
as no different from a feudal lord, where the serf has no inherent 
rights and the lord has all. We no longer recognize the authority 
of government to claim its sovereignty over our property and 
productivity.

Technology wants to be Free: The consistent trend toward greater 
advancements in technology indicates that opposition to its 
advancement is not progressive, but reactive and conservative. That 
advancement in technology consistently improve the ability of the 
individual to live with an increasingly smaller impact upon the 
environment demonstrates that technology is green. That advancements
in technology also consistently improve the ability of the individual
to contribute and make their voices heard in the community and society
at large demonstrates that technology wants freedom for all of us. 
Applying fascistic controls on the right of the individual to use, 
produce, buy and sell any technology for the betterment of emself and
es fellow human are to be opposed by any means necessary.

Private Stewardship is Superior to Public Management: History has 
consistently shown that private landowners manage the environment on 
their land in a superior manner to that of government controlled 
land. The 2/3 of the land area in the western US that is still in 
federal hands should be distributed to the people for their private 
stewardship of it, and public land of no intrinsic worth as sites of 
beauty and historic landmarks around the world should be distributed 
to the people who are best able to care for them.

Corporations are NOT Persons: A corporation is merely an association 
of laborers, and deserves no more protection for itself or its work 
than any private professional worker. Corporations have no right to 
buy influence in public discourse or government policymaking, or in 
the election of individuals to public positions. Just as a government
should have no more power to commit acts that individuals are 
restricted from doing, so to should corporations not have the 
ability to carry any more influence than a single individual. A 
corporation cannot confiscate the individual rights of those that 
associate with it, as such rights are inalienable, nor can those 
that associate with it use their communal voice, influence, or money 
to indimidate or force others to surrender their own rights.

The Individual is Sovereign: We re-establish that every individual 
is endowed and evolved by its creator, Nature, with all inalienable 
rights, and that the community, corporation, association, society, 
state, nation, gender or ethnic group has none, as such entities are 
fictitious memetic constructs which only exist in the human 
imagination. Any attempt by such a group to restrain the rights of 
the individual is a crime against humanity.

The Universe is for Everyone: Real Estate existing outside the bounds 
of Earth that is unclaimed and uninhabited by other intelligent beings
is free to be claimed by the first individuals to reach said real 
estate, stake their claim, improve its condition, and defend it 
against interlopers. No fictitious legal entity has the right to 
restrict the ability of the individual to inhabit and settle in 
unclaimed territory, and no individual is bound to obey any such 
restriction.

Your Genes are Your Intellectual Property: The unique DNA and RNA 
sequences that describes the individual in whose cells those 
sequences are found retains original property rights over that 
unique sequence. Corporate entities, associations, or governments, 
having no DNA to describe their memetic structure, cannot own 
rights to DNA or RNA sequences except as licensed to them by the 
individuals who posess or create them. Naturally evolved DNA and RNA 
sequences cannot be owned by any individual or group, as they are 
the property of all of Nature's creations.

Your Property is Your Life: Since one's home, land, and means of 
transportation, self protection, and production play such a 
crucial role in supporting the life of the individual and eir 
dependents, Property Crimes committed against individuals by other
individuals or groups, whether for personal gain, political 
expression, or public policy are crimes against life, and are to 
be defended against as capital crimes are.

You are Responsible for Yourself: Placing demands upon the property 
and resources of others is theft and slavery. Individual Sovereignty
mandates Individual Responsbility. The consenting Individual is 
responsible for the security, maintenance, protection, and impact 
upon others of their own property, productivity, progeny, and person. 

Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law: Any idea, action, 
expression, or activity by consenting adults which does not 
alienate the rights of other individuals cannot be restrained by 
any other individual or group.

Look up Castor. According to this site, it's a *hexary* star system!
Three binaries, two with periods of days, one with a period of less than
ten hours. Woo... wild ride.

Err, correction, the third binary in Castor has a period of under 20,
not under 10 hours.

Ah, but *which* feds?  The feds behind Carnivore, or the feds who think
that exposing and toasting Carnivore might get them re-elected to
"defend us from the feds"?

Helium3 on Venus doesn't seem real probable does it?

However...here's the reference.....

"Venus irradiates forty times more energy than it receives from the Sun, as 
is indicated by the data from Magellan Sonde between 1990 and 1994 (Broad,

For better or for worse, (I think for better, as you may recall),
intellectualy property is obsolete.  Ideas and information can only remain
private property by keeping them secret.  Once known to another, a
copy of the ideas and information belongs to them; they can do what
they wish with it, even modifying it and distributing it to others.

Is that morally right?  It might be.  Nothing has been confiscated
from you when I distribute your genetic information except your right
to dictate what I can and can't say to others; it is very doubtful
that you had a right like that to begin with.  Even though you might
want it quite badly.  Even though I would be required to recompense
you if you had such a right and I violated it.

I happen to think that Nature bestowed rights on us in a very
particular way: by making the world in such a way as to make certain
acts against persons irrational.  This theory of rights leaves many of
our rights in a rather contingent state; certain rights you hold today
may not be rational to hold tomorrow.

It is irrational to try to enforce intellectual property rights on a
world containing encryption.

Sorry, doesn't wash. You are responsible for your offspring. If I grab
your DNA (and possibly your spouses as well) and produce a dozen of your
offspring, not only have I made you responsible for 12 people without
your consent, but I have violated your right of reproduction of your
genome. Just because its easy for me to do so does not mean you did not
have those rights to begin with.

Just because it is easy for you to violate a person's right does not
mean that right never existed. I can disarm, rape, and kill people all
day long. That doesn't mean I didn't violate their rights or that they
had no rights to life, self defense, or control of their bodies.

Only if you take a contingency based view of life. Opportunism is a
bankrupt ethic.

Sorry, that is a morally vacant statement. Its like saying its
irrational to enforce one's right to life in a world where killing
people is easy.

Survivor' Spin-Off May Involve Mir

MOSCOW (AP) - ``Survivor'' lovers, brace yourselves. The reality-TV game
show rage may climax with the winning contestant in a spin-off series
blasting off for a stay aboard Russia's Mir space  station.
 Mark Burnett, producer of the wildly successful ``Survivor'' 
television series, has signed an agreement with the MirCorp investment
group to develop a project at Russia's cosmonaut  training facility
outside Moscow, Burnett's manager said Friday. The show, tentatively
named ``Destination Mir,'' would track contestants as they endure
rigorous training in preparation for a trip to the 14-year-old station.
Russian training specialists would eliminate contestants who aren't up
to the task, and the last one left would win a rocket ride to Mir.

Michael, you might have a valid point... I'm not sure.  The following
argument has a hole a mile wide in it, however.

> You are responsible for your offspring.

Granted.

> If I grab your DNA (and possibly your spouses as well) and produce a dozen
> of your offspring, not only have I made you responsible for 12 people
without
> your consent,

Sorry, that doesn't follow.  If you produce them, they are YOUR offspring,
not mine.  The source of the genetic material is, well, immaterial!  Your
could have stolen it... you could have coded it from the ground up... who
cares?  It's just bits of information until some entity (you, in this case)
acts to turn those bits into a human being.  By your argument, a scientist
who created an organism out of whole cloth wouldn't be responsible for that
organism (he wasn't the donor for the genetic material)... in fact, since
there was no donor, no one would be responsible for it.

You are responsible for your own actions.  I'm not.

Loree

Wonderful! I have found some similar catalogues, such as
http://www.xmission.com/~dnash/astrodir/eos/encpages/contents.html
(sunlike nearby stars, very nice interface and discussion) and
http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/aricns/ (rather bad interface, lots
of good data).  I'm as usual involved in a sf world construction
effort, and these have been quite useful.

I also recommend http://www.sky3d.com/ - I have been flying around our
spiral arm, thinking of whether I want to go for the Orion complex,
the Cygnus complex or just head for the Core once I turn into a
nanoswarm :-)

The info below is the result of a SIMBAD catalog search I did 10 years
ago on eps Eri.  SIMBAD probably has much more recent data (Hipparcos)
now, but maybe the below is still useful for you. Several infrared
astronomy groups I was involved with at NASA Ames, observed this star
alot.  It's a K main sequence circumstellar dust (infrared excess)
star. I wrote some old notes about these infrared excess stars here

The Breakthrough


It begins with a concept;
A thought, a passion...
Something potential, but never quite real--
A seed within a seed.

It strokes the subconscious and pleads with the conscious
To let it be free.

When realized, it reaps the mind of endless resources,
In its quest to become corporeal;
Only then does it awaken the sense of life within you,
And cause your mind to bear witness to possibility.

You work together, day and night, 
To give it life, ambition and soul;
To bring it present and future, beauty and fate,
And to make its meaning whole.

And one day you see it, naked, kinetic and true,
Anointed with the lifeblood of confidence;
You make it your duty to show the world the beauty
Of its purity: the Breakthrough.

I'm not arguing that the right never existed, just that the right to
prevent others from copying information doesn't exist now.

Anyway, my main point is this: Even if it is an existant right to
prevent others from copying certain pieces of information, there's
nothing that you can do to stop it, and the situation will become even
more hopeless for you as encryption and "ripping" technologies of
various sorts improve.  You might regard these developments as bad; I
don't.  But they are unstoppable.

It's not irrational to enforce one's alleged right.  It's irrational
to TRY to do so if enforcement is impossible.  (Lucky for us, it's a
lot easier to enforce one's right to live than it is to enforce
copyright.)

It is important for people who want to understand future technology, to know the
difference between quantum electronics and quantum computing.  Most modern
computers use some form of quantum electronics, such as Fowler-Nordheim tunneling
in NVRAM and FPGA circuits (see:
http://www.lns.cornell.edu/public/CESR/SRF/BasicSRF/SRFBas31.html), however, these
are not quantum computers in any book on the subject.  You could have all the
quantum electronics you want and still not be able to build a machine that could
solve problems that require more than polynomial time.

Bottom Line --  No superposition, no quantum computer.

I've always though I understood how switching/packing data worked on the
internet, but maybe I'm missing something.  People keep talking about
how people can be tracked down using their IP number.  My question is
how so?

The IP address only tells the seeker what server you're logged into.
Since you are probably one of at least a hundred other users at that IP
address, how could anyone possibly identify you by IP address?

It looks like a sound concept but it will take quite a while to get it
to market- he obviously hasn't yet built a prototype.  One possible
refinement (if very high power densities are desired) is to bias the
balls in a panel to approxiamte a spherical surface, so that all the
individual beams converge at the target, instead of shining parallel. 
Alternately this would allow fewer panels for a small installation yet
still reach useful tempratures to run a heat engine.

Yet every legal precedent in the country states that ultimately it is
the biological parents who are responsible for their biological
children.

Not at all- consider two ways to heat that chunk of lead: a blowtorch in
the open air, or a small heating element under a thick layer of
insulation.  The equilibrium temperature is the same, but the heat
fluxes are vastly different.

Hmmm, that's kinda sparse.  However, if you have both a high
reflectivity and a low emmissivity, the *net* heat fluxes can be hard to
determine, swamped by the strong sunlight.  It sounds like an instrument
calibration problem to me...

a) the ability to kill others, quite easily, has existed since the dawn

b) we still have a right to life

So when making ebola-like cold viruses is a 6th graders science project,
nobody has a right to live anymore? Sorry, doesn't wash. Opportunism is
not an ethic.

Every individual is assigned a temporary dynamic IP address when logged
into the server ( the server has to know which logged in user to send
packets to), and keeps a log of what subscribers used what dynamic IP
addresses for what period of time, and typically which modem on the ISP
system they were logged in on. Checking the phone company records for
that call, you can find out what phone number called into that modem,
and what the location of that phone number is. If you are doing this
while the caller is still logged in, you can test the signal for
forwarding, to see if the signals are orginating there, or simply being
forwarded from there, and if so where from, etc...

The word "right" gets bandied about quite a bit, as if it were some sort of 
God-given entity.  The fact is that the "right" to anything is nothing more 
than a man-made fiction.  It is *really* perplexing to me when people who 
deny the existence of “God” nonetheless talk about human rights as if they 
were bestowed by God.

None of us has any right which we don't have the power to enforce.  In 
essence, "might makes right."  For instance, at one point in time it was the 
law in the U.S. that the black man “had no rights which the white man was 
bound to respect.”  Why?  Because the black man was utterly without any 
power to enforce any rights he might like to take unto himself.  Did the 
black man like that state of affairs?  No.  Was it fair, perhaps not.  But 
that’s the way it was.

And that’s the way it is.  If you have no power to prevent me from making 
use of content you create, you have no “right” to do so either.  You can 
piss and moan all day about what rights you think you have, but its no 
different from me claiming that I have the right to inherit the moon.  Get 
used to it and get over it.

My IP address only tells *you* which server I'm logged into (unless I have a 
static IP), but my ISP keeps a log of what user is using which IP at which 
time.  So if I do something naughty, you can go to my ISP with (1) my IP 
address and (2) the date and time of my naugty behavior, and they can track 
me down and chastise me accordingly.

If you happen to have a static IP, (like I do) then all you need to know is 
the IP.

Well the festivities have gotten off to an appropriately malodorous start.  
PETA has dumped a ton of poop in front of the Wilshire Grand Hotel, where 
lots of the delegates are staying.  Peee-yooo!

For anyone in town, I just heard that Rage Against the Machine is going to

Pershing Square at 4:00 p.m., and end at the Staples Center with the

Your logical fallacy here is you assume that people think that rights

Yet he got his rights without any might, right? So your claim is

Subject: Britain to allow human cloning for research

  	  				 
   LONDON, Aug 13 (AFP) - The British government is set to give its  
cautious go-ahead this week to the cloning of human embryos for 
therapeutic research, according to media reports here Sunday. 
   A report by the government's chief medical officer, Liam  
Donaldson, is due to be published Wednesday, three months after it 
was handed in. 
   Ministers are expected to agree with its recommendation to allow  
cloning, but only for research purposes, the Sunday Telegraph 
reported. 
   However, such are the moral and ethical dimensions of the case  
that MPs will be allowed a free vote on the issue, the paper said. 
   Normally, MPs vote along party lines.  
   Allowing cloning of human embyro cells for research would accord  
with the opinion of many scientists, who believe it will pave the 
way to new cures for many illnesses. 
   Other groups and religious organisations say cloning for  
experimentation breaks the sanctity of human life. 
   At the heart of the matter is the removal of pre-programmed  
cells, called stem cells, from embryos less than 14 days old. 
   Scientists have discovered that such stem cells are capable of  
developing into any kind of tissue, including nerves, muscle, organs 
and bone. 
   If, one day, it was possible to direct stem cells to become  
selected types of replacement tissue, it could be used to treat a 
host of diseases which at present are incurable. 
   And if the embryos are cloned from a patient's own cells, it  
would solve the serious problem of transplant tissue rejection. 
   The research needed to bring about such a medical revolution is  
currently banned in Britain, however. 
   As the law stands, scientists can only work with stem cells less  
than 14 days old to carry out research into understanding fertility, 
reproduction or congenital disorders. 
   Using stem cells for any other purpose is outlawed, as is the  
cloning of human embryos. 
   In December 1998 two research watchdogs recommended the law be  
relaxed to allow therapeutic cloning for medical research. Last year 
the government set up an advisory group under Donaldson to examine 
the issue.

BS.  You can't get away with statements like that.  "every legal
precedent"?!!??
You went from bad to worse.

It's true that the laws are being rewritten almost daily as surrogate
mothers, artificial insemination, different adoptions paths and womens right
to choose (no choice for fathers) cause more such cases to appear on the
dockets of family courts in all juristictions.

Do a real legal search... don't just make "facts" up of the top of your
head.

P.S.  I did have the line "Then come back and appologize." as the last line
of my message, but I suddenly realized you've never met me and wouldn't have
understood that I was just kidding around.

Its pretty well standard, perhaps some of the lawyers like Greg can
contribute. I know of a case, for instance, in Kentucky, where a woman
signed a contract with a teenage boy to inseminate her, acknowledging
him giving up all rights and her giving up all claims on him. Yet a few
years later when he became an adult and she was unemployed, she got a
court to break the contract and despite his counterclaim of statutory

Just because you didn't consent to the childs conception and birth does
not negate your responsibility for your biological offspring.

Interesting....

Cloneing technology is not too far around the corner.....it's barely 
conceivable that ANY cell could be used to clone a person.  Say...a hair 
follicle....

Now imagine the trouble that would cause....

Liable for any genetic descendent yousay?

    I just started reading the subject book.

    Seems quite interesting in exploring the subtle
mechanisms through which individuals become
effectively nodes in a neural net.

    Anyone have opinions?  Bloom takes a strong
position in favor of "group selection".

The greatest concerns of the "public" in general seem to have to do with
immediate harm they, or other organisms such as butterflies, could suffer
due to exposure to GM foods. The following passage from Patrick Brown's
article was highlighted on the web page: "Indeed, it can be argued that gene
transfer via rDNA techniques resembles the process of viral infection far
more closely than it resembles traditional breeding."  This sounds scary,
and given that the highlighted portions are the only parts of the article
that many people will read, it's probably safe to conclude that many people
will come away from the article with a bit more convinced of the
advisability of strict government controls on genetic research.

The following paragraphs from PB's article nicely summarize my main
concerns:

"The real threat to the future of plant biotechnology is the irresponsible
and premature releases of the first generation of GMOs that are full of
unsound scientific assumptions, rife with careless science, and arrogantly
dismissive of valid concerns.

The current generation of GMOs provide little real benefit except corporate
profit and marginally improved grower returns, while at the same time
introducing a host of poorly studied human and ecological risks. Not
surprisingly, many have questioned the value of these crops and the
integrity of those who support their use."

The current state of research in the field of plant genetics (I'm speaking
here only of US research; I'm not as familiar with reserach elsewhere) has
been brought about largely by the high level of involvement of the federal
government, and government-assisted corporations such as Monsanto, in
agricultural research of all sorts. Most agricultural schools push the
concept of farming-be-formula as the only possible way to go; and every
formula will naturally involve the use of the commercial products offered by
Monsanto.

Most US farmers rely heavily on various subsidies provided by the federal
gov't, and again at the level of local agricultural extension services,
farming-by-formula is pushed as the only sensible way to go.  This isn't
surprising given that the extension service agents have been educated in the
schools which teach this same thing.

The conclusion drawn by the "public" seems to be that we need MORE gov't
involvement in agricultural.  The only way I can see that someone could
logically arrive at this conclusion is by ignoring most of the available
data.

The greatest threat I see from the current direction of GM technology is
widespread famine in the not so distant future as a larger and larger
proportion of the world's agricutural lands are planted in genetically
almost-identical cultivars of a few staple crops. This same danger existed
with the use of hybrid corns produced the old-fashioned way; it's not unique
to GM crops.  What disturbs me is that GM technology is being used to push
world agriculture farther along that same path rather than along a more
healthily branching path of genetic diversity.

The 1970 corn leaf blight epidemic, which destroyed half the corn crop from
Floria to Texas, should be heeded as a warning.  In this case a new strain
of the fungus which causes southern leaf blight was able to spread unchecked
through fields of genetically identical hybrid corn. This would not have
been nearly so likely to happen with wider genetic diversity in corn
cultivars and smaller fields of corn interplanted with other crops. As the
shift is made world-wide from thousands of local cultivars to the
farming-by-formula use of a few GM cultivars, the danger increases of a
larger-scale version of the corn blight catastrophe. I'd go so far as to say
it's inevitable if the agricultural industry continues its present course.

I'd like to see more pure research being done, more effort put into
UNDERSTANDING genetics.  There are so many questions that are interesting in
and of themselves--such as, for instance, how transposons fit into the
process. But most of the money that's available for genetic research is
funneled through the federal gov't and corporations and universities
controlled by the same ideas and often the same people.

One solution I see is to set up research facilities that are not associated
in any way with any gov't or gov't assisted corporation. As I've mentioned
before on this list, an "underground" economy with "underground" research
facilities.

That is the definite problem. Will legal precedent yield to
technological advancement? This is a conundrum that will be used to
restrict the technology, place requirements that all clones be created
only as authorized by the legal owner of that DNA, which is why a
person's unique genome shall become their property. Perhaps not
intellectual property, but their property nonetheless.

One thing I like about nanotechnology is that it can be used to aid and
measure quality processes with manufacturing.  For example, if nano is
applied to some process or method then it might make some economically
viable where they otherwise might not be, in terms of utility.

Subject: Rand and the Reality of Self-Sacrifice


    Bloom's recent book _Global Brain_ has numerous
examples of how the individual is programmed by the
social organims for self-destruction in service of the
group....

    Rand never accepted the naive individualistic premise
that "everyone" works for their self-interest.  On the contrary,
she always argued for the reality of self-sacrifice, in her view, the
primary factor in the success of tyranny.

        What confuses the issue is that any successful action,
even a self-sacrificial one results in some measure pleasure
even though vastly more substantial pains may also result
either simultaneously or later.

   IAN: When Savant dismissed the claim that

   she dismissed the claim per se, which I
   read to say that its false both logically
   and empirically. I guess the hypothesis
   that all people behave with their self-

   because some people assume that it's true.
   Okay, so it's false and we answered that

   any examples that might support his claims).

   IAN: Who cares about your archive? It's online:

   Now you can support your implication that
   the claim that the Govt is spraying the flu
   is a theory that was created by Ian Goddard.
   Now you can also prove that you debunked the
   claim. But the sad fact is that almost every
   counter you raised against the Thomas claim
   was shown to be false. For example, you argued
   that the Govt would NEVER spary toxins on the
   US population, which is why you had to smear
   the doctor who was covering the many times
   that the Govt DID spray on US populations.

YOUR PAPERS, PLEASE ...
Human ID implant to be unveiled soon
'Wearers' of Digital Angel' monitored by GPS, Internet
by JoAnn Kohlbrand <BR>and Julie Foster
------------------------------------------------------------------

A working prototype of an implant designed to monitor the
physiology and whereabouts of human wearers, known as Digital
Angel, is scheduled to be unveiled in October at an
invitation-only event in New York City -- two months ahead of
schedule.

Developed by  Applied Digital Solutions, the device is said to
be the first-ever operational combination of bio-sensor
technology and Web-enabled wireless telecommunications linked
to global positioning satellite location-tracking systems.

Applied Digital Solutions Chairman Richard Sullivan said the
development of the technology has progressed well ahead of
schedule.

"We're extremely heartened by the remarkable progress made by
Dr. Peter Zhou and his entire research team, including
professors and their associates at Princeton University and the
New Jersey Institute of Technology," said Sullivan. "This
technology relates directly to the exploding wireless
marketplace. We'll be demonstrating for the first time ever
that wireless telecommunications systems and bio-sensor devices
-- capable of measuring and transmitting critical body function
data -- can be successfully linked together with GPS (global
positioning satellite) technology and integrated with the
Internet."

As previously reported in WorldNetDaily, Digital Angel is
intended to serve a number of functions. In addition to
locating missing persons and monitoring physiological data, the
device will be marketed to the world of e-commerce as a means
of verifying online consumer identity.

Similar to microchip technologies currently used as  electronic
ID tags for pets, Digital Angel is a dime-sized implant,
inserted just under the skin. When implanted within a human
body, the device is powered electromechanically through the
movement of muscles and can be activated either by the "wearer"
or by a monitoring facility.

Applied Digital Solutions is also exploring avenues for
utilizing Digital Angel without implanting it.

"We are currently talking to a watch maker who is interested in
placing the device on the back of their watches," Sullivan told
WorldNetDaily. "In addition, technology is being developed that
would allow Digital Angel to function from the back of a
cellular phone, transmitting bio-sensor information when
carried by the user."

While estimates of Digital Angel's marketplace potential vary,
Sullivan and Applied Digital's partners believe they can enter
the implant into a multi-billion dollar market through various
licensing arrangements, Web-enabled wireless services and data
transactions handled by Applied Digital's Application Service
Provider center.

Those attending the event in New York City will see a working,
multimedia demonstration of the implant. A miniature sensor
device -- smaller than a grain of rice and equipped with a tiny
antenna -- will capture and wirelessly transmit a person's
vital body-function data, such as body temperature or pulse, to
an Internet-integrated ground station. In addition, the antenna
will also receive information regarding the location of the
individual from the GPS satellite. Both sets of data -- medical
information and location -- will then be wirelessly transmitted
to the ground station and made available on Web-enabled
desktop, laptop or wireless devices.

According to Applied Digital, the demonstration will represent
the first time these technologies have been united into one
functioning system.

The New York event -- at a time, date and location to be
announced later -- will feature live presentations from top
Applied Digital executives, including Sullivan and Dr. Peter
Zhou, president and chief scientist at DigitalAngel.net, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Digital. Attendees at the
device's unveiling ceremony will include a handpicked group of
potential joint-venture partners, as well as senior-level
players in the e-commerce, wireless and Internet industries,
and stock analysts.

Zhou is passionately enthusiastic about the device.

"I'm particularly excited about Digital Angel's ability to save
lives by remotely monitoring the medical conditions of at-risk
patients and providing emergency rescue units with the person's
exact location," he said. "I also see great potential for
Digital Angel in the area of 'location-aware' e-commerce. This
is a whole new wireless and Web-enabled frontier in which a
purchaser's actual location is integral to making a successful
sale or providing a valuable, location-critical service."

In an exclusive interview with WorldNetDaily in March, Zhou
expressed his belief that the implant will be as popular as
cell phones and vaccines.

Digital Angel, said Zhou, "will be a connection from yourself to
the electronic world. It will be your guardian, protector. It
will bring good things to you."

He added, "We will be a hybrid of electronic intelligence and
our own soul."

Applied Digital Solutions first announced it had acquired the
patent rights to a miniature digital transceiver in December
1999. Naming the device Digital Angel, ADS formed
DigitalAngel.net, Inc. to serve as the research and development
unit for the device. Since that time, ADS has actively promoted
the implant, pointing to what executives and scientists say are
lifestyle benefits of the chip.

"The first market we hope to tap into is a $10 billion
agri-industry," said Sullivan. "The FDA is requiring improved
tracking methods for beef and poultry. The Digital Angel, with
its ability to monitor body functions, can track quality from
the [animal] pens to the supermarket."

The next large market ADS hopes to tap into is that of
preventive medical tracking. Through its body function tracking
capabilities, the Digital Angel can monitor such functions as
body temperature, heartbeat and specific needs such as insulin
levels. This information can then be transmitted to a doctor or
health-care provider.

"The Digital Angel serves as an advance warning device, which
can help lower the cost of medical care," commented Sullivan.

However, despite the excitement over an early working model of
this new technology, concerns have been raised as to personal
privacy. With the integrated technology, a person's location,
health status and other personal data will be transmitted and
available via the Internet.

ADS claims, however, that privacy concerns are misplaced, since
the device can be turned off by the owner.

Additional concerns have been raised by Christians, who contend
Digital Angel could be the fulfillment of a  biblical
prediction found in the book of Revelation.

Zhou, president of DigitalAngel.net, Inc., disagrees.

"I am a Christian, but I don't think [that argument] makes
sense," he told WND in March. "The purpose of the device is to
save your life and improve the quality of life. There's no
connection to the Bible."

As the technology becomes more commonplace, the debate, as well
as sales, are likely to continue growing.

"We'll soon be ready to move ahead to the production-design
phase of Digital Angel geared to specific marketplace
applications," Sullivan said. "The key message right now is
this: Digital Angel isn't a blue-sky technology. This is real.
Digital Angel breakthrough technology is here. It's live!"

The researchers recently discovered that errant bacteria survive in the 
cleanest of clean rooms by inducing the top semiconductor layer on chips to 
grow over them, thereby embedding themselves inside the chip. 

When SUNY researcher Robert Baier started to investigate the role bacteria 
play in the yield problem, he knew they were avoiding even the most stringent 
attempts to eradicate them â€” the bugs just wouldn't die. How could bacteria 
survive where no other living thing can? Baier, funded by the National 
Science Foundation, found the answer, but it wasn't what he expected. 

"When we started this study, we were just trying to find the source of 
bacteria in the fab, and how they could remain alive after all the heroic 
measures to eradicate them with ultraviolet light, ozone and everything else 
including a dollar a gallon to purify the water," said Baier, who is director 
of the Center for Biosurfaces at SUNY. 

Other scientists and engineers participated in the research at the Center for 
Microcontamination Control at the University of Arizona, the Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute in New York and the Center for Environmentally Benign 
Semiconductor Manufacturing at the University of Arizona. 

The problem wasn't people in the fab getting sick â€” those kinds of bacteria 
were easy to kill. Rather, it concerned some clever bugs that just wouldn't 
die, no matter what â€” bacteria that can survive in the vacuum of space, or 
inside a volcanic vent at the bottom of the sea. They can hibernate 
indefinitely and only need the slightest bit of light to wake up and thrive 
anew. 

"We found that these extremely hard-to-kill bacteria were coming in with the 
ultrapure water, and the way they survived our calculated assault was to 
capture a tiny bit of semiconductor that had dissolved in the ultrapure water 
and start growing," said Baier. 

Once the bacterium sticks a molecule of semiconductor to itself, other 
dissolved crystals spontaneously attach themselves to the formation, growing 
islands atop silicon wafers during a subsequent vapor deposition step. 

In short order, the bacteria have encased themselves inside armored shells of 
semiconductor, making them impervious to all the attempts by clean-room 
personnel to kill them. "These bacteria can cause a lot of problems in the 
clean room, like shorting out adjacent lines on chips, and inside these 
armored shells they are almost impossible to kill," said Baier. "Now we are 
turning a problem into a feature. A plant is basically a single-electron 
photonic device converting light into electricity. If we embed a 
photosensitive bacteria inside a chip, we have the beginnings of a 
biotransistor." 

Baier's goal of harnessing bacteria as the active element in a transistor may 
not be as far-fetched as it sounds â€” at least his theory sounds convincing. 
He points out that copper is a conductor because it has one free electron per 
atom to contribute to current flow. Semiconductors are called "semi" because 
they have only about one free electron per thousand atoms, depending on 
doping levels. Current flow in those semiconductors, unlike copper, can be 
precisely controlled by parameters that match the parameters of bacteria, 
according to Baier, enabling regular transistors to switch from an insulator 
into a conductor by changing state. 

'Many uses'


These small charge transfers, Baier contends, are just what happens in common 
biological processes like respiration and photosynthesis. In fact, he 
believes that the current flowing in a semiconductor can be controlled by the 
chlorophyll in a single cell. For instance, when light shines on a 
photosensitive bacterium, it yields up an electron that could be used to 
switch a primitive biotransistor. "This is a new class of biochips, which I 
believe can be adapted to many uses, but at present it's at a primitive 
stage, like the crude crystal detectors that preceded today's radios," said 
Baier. 

The theory is that doping semiconductors is always done to disrupt the 
perfect lattice, making free electrons or "holes" available in "n-" and "p-" 
type semiconductors, respectively. Likewise, if a biological atom, say 
phosphorus with five electrons from a bacterium's cell, is doped into a 
silicon crystal that only needs four, it then makes the fifth electron 
available, enabling biological cells to serve as metabolic "sources" and 
"sinks" for electrons and "holes" in biotransistors. 

"Biological membranes have been known to develop potentials of a million 
volts per centimeter. They are perfect for semiconductors, and biochips using 
them could be made as small as five microns on a side," said Baier. 

According to Baier, most of the steps used to build chips today will continue 
to be used in manufacturing his biochips. For instance, masks will be used on 
the semiconductor doped with bacteria, as will diffusion, sputtering and 
other common deposition techniques. All the other common devices like 
resistors and capacitors will be built into circuits connected to the 
biotransistors. 

Optical amps


Biotransistors will also simplify optical communications by amplifying 
optical beams the way a normal transistor amplifies electrical current. And 
Baier envisions the construction of light-sensitive heterojunctions where 
lattices of different energy gaps are "biodoped" so that their crystalline 
lattices mesh imperfectly, creating atomic-scale defects and strains with 
useful photonic and electrical side effects to drive circuitry. Such 
heterojunctions would harness complicated biophysical reactions to provide a 
tunable variable for design problems. 

For now, Baier will be satisfied if he can build a "crystal" radio with his 
biochip architecture. His approach will be to follow the recipe of Bardeen 
and Brattain when they invented the world's first transistor. As with the 
original, Baier plans to attach two fine wires only micrometers apart, but 
this time in a biodoped germanium crystal that has been bonded to a metal 
disk. The assembly will be housed inside a metal cylinder electrically 
grounded to the disk. Bardeen and Brattain's "cat's whisker" will be 
connected to a meter to register success or failure.

While I agree nanotech can be used to "aid and measure quality," the example
Ross gives seems to be off the mark.  To me, aiding in quality would be any
thing or process that increases quality, such as testing a product before
rolling it out the door and making changes based on the tests (and then, of
course, retesting).  Or having clear specifications and requirements for the
product.  (Working in the software industry, I've seen people build product
without such.:)

Measuring quality would be any thing or process that yields information
quality, such as some way of probing metal parts for aircraft to make sure
they don't have microfractures.

Of course, the two go hand in hand.  I think nanotechnology could be
directly applied to both, since it will allow finer control over
construction of things as well as finer detection of flaws in them.

I also agree with the example Ross uses, those this is one of nanotechnology
increases the capabilities of building (and repairing) things overall.  I
believe, if it pans out, it will allow things to be built which hitherto
could either not be built at all or which would be cost prohibitive (the
abstract example he uses).  But most people on this list already know that.

That said, I wish stuff would start to leave the lab.  Of course, there are
no nanoassemblers in Drexler's sense yet, but some things could be massed
produced using current technology, such as nanowire, nanotubes, and the like
and start to find their way into non-nanotech products, such as cars,
aircraft, space vehicles, and lab equipment.  (Nanoscale measuring devices
would be especially good for the lab.)

My two cents!

Your characterization of the movement against Stossel as "administrative
fascism" seems to me entirely appropriate and accurate. I don't expect Congress
to investigate this destructive and irresponsible trend anytime soon, because
Congress itself operates under identical enforcement of conformity.
As for whether they "are being SELECTIVELY enforced to the benefit of some and
the detriment of others to add to the injustice which they perpetrate," I'd
answer "Yes, definitely."

They didnt say how much it costs.  If reasonable, Ill take one.  Recall
some time ago I bought up the notion of a group of volunteers who
are willing to have *every* aspect of their lives open to scrutiny
by anyone.  Heres one application: testing the new human ID implants.
Another is voice recognition and verification for purchases.  Ill do it!
Pick meeeeeeee!

Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was recovered
yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?  spike

Well, it would be possible to use nanoscopes to see structural defects at a
level finer than currently.  That, way, all the processes could be tuned for
comprehensive fitness.

In terms of nanotech replication machines it could probably reproduce nanotechs
at a pretty fast rate.  That means very high quality crystals until it is used
for plastics and other polymers.

A message to the elves of the night

The destruction of GE crops is on the rise in North America. In the past
six months there have been numerous assaults on GE crops in Maine,
Vermont, Minnesota, California and British Columbia. This is a perfect
example of a case where the enemy is weaker than one might think. Test
crops are easy to destroy, anyone can cut down a crop, yet the destruction
of test crops costs seed companies considerable time. The work of these
high tech companies can be disrupted by the most simple means. This is one
of the reasons why the sabotage of crops has spread so widely. Because of
the outrage over genetically modified foods many have taken direct action
against capital. But there are many other simple ways to attack capital,
so why stop there now that so many people have practice as elves of the
night?

The sabotage of genetically modified crops is aimed at a new technological
development, in this case a biotechnological development. Its aim is to
cripple the advance of technology, which was also the aim of the Luddites
The most recent advances are often the only forms of technology to be
critiqued or attacked because they are the most shocking. But these recent
advances are not separate from other forms of technology, they function
systematically with other technologies for the utility of capital: the
exploitation of nature and human beings. It is far more common to be
critical of the most advanced forms of technology while the machines that
the Luddites had sabotaged now seem benign. This is because we have grown
up with them and often fail to see their negative effects. It is much
easier to be critical of the technologies that we are unfamiliar with
because we can still perceive their destructive and alien qualities. For
example, it is easier to see that the internet is alienating and replaces
contact with real human beings or that it increases control, than the
telephone. We are blind to the effects of the telephone because for us
these effects have always been there. This naturalization of technologies
also blinds us from seeing technology as a system. We see instead
proliferation of "tools". But, for what end are these tools made? Are they
merely made for a variety of individual human uses to fulfill a variety of
individual needs or are they produced by systems for the use of those
systems? Technology is produced by capitalist companies and governments
for their use. These technologies are a product of the logic of capital.
Our critique and our attacks must reach beyond the most recent advances of
the technological system to other technological means of exploitation and
alienation. Elves of the night, there is so much to do!

Put it in kids, prisoners, convicts, and dangerous dogs, and whoever is

I'll give the readers digest condensed version. Let's say X is a problem a
computer can solve, now let's increase the number of variables in the problem,
can the computer still solve it before the sun burns out? If the time to solve the
problem only increases as X^n where n is any integer then we say problem is in
polynomial time and solvable; but if the time to solve the problem increases as
n^X it's exponential and not solvable with a normal computer because just a small
increase in the number of variables yields a huge increase in the time to solve it.

The reason people get excited about Quantum Computers is that when a conventional
64 bit single processor computer performs an operation, it does it on one 64 bit number
at a time. When a 64 bit (actually a 64 qubit) single processor Quantum Computer
performs an operation the numbers are in superposition so it operates on all 64 bit numbers
at the same time, all 2^64 of them, more than a billion billion, and any increase in the number
of qubits the computer can handle will increase its already astronomical power exponentially.

Thanks JR. I think very highly of Stossel's journalism as you do. So I try
to think about the issues which he puts forward. The kind of tyranny which
he described on the campuses can be stopped but it requires good, sound
social science which has just about been extinguished by propaganda wars.
Such a good, sound study would require putting all those "speech and
conduct codes" of the campuses together for analysis. Then one would do
surveys to see if favoritism or selectivity is being practiced in their
enforcement. I think I can make some pretty sound predictions of what the
results will be. The study I propose would expose the folly of "Totem and
Taboo In America" as it is practiced by fanatical witch doctors in ivory
towers. Congress could undertake it for the sake of preserving free speech
which could be thoroughly destroyed by one generation from now but as you
say, it almost certainly won't act.

They didnt say how much it costs.  If reasonable, Ill take one.  Recall
some time ago I bought up the notion of a group of volunteers who
are willing to have *every* aspect of their lives open to scrutiny
by anyone.  Heres one application: testing the new human ID implants.
Another is voice recognition and verification for purchases.  Ill do it!
Pick meeeeeeee!

Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was recovered
yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?  spike

Michael!  First a hypothetical situation with a flawed conclusion, then a
sweeping generalized argument from authority and now anecdotal evidence?

I could play battling anecdotes with you, but it wouldn't prove anything.
You still haven't actually answered my first two objections.

A) You are responsible for your own actions.

B) Do the research if you are going to make an "argument from authority".
It's a weak argument in any case... but you don't get to make stuff up.
That isn't how reasoned discourse works.

True, no there are no *god given rights*.

Empathy may change a persons *bad* behaviour, a person may refrain from rape
or killing because of empathy yet the *stealing* of intellectual property
may or may not be stopped by empathy.

If you abandon the concept of *fair* and the rather flaccid view of *well,
that's just the way things are....." and instead ask "What are the
consequences of this state of affairs and how can things be made better?"
you may well improve a situation.

I have no right to *make* you leave *my stuff* alone......and I personally
(being poor and all that!!!) have no power. But should I lack any empathy
and sympathy plus be rich (and very pissed off) I could hire an assassin to
change your mind.


You can

A belief that one has rights is not the cause of the problem. In the case of
*intellectual theft* or simply car theft someone may be seriously pissed off
because money may well be lost as a result (money = food, security and
choice in most societies) so unless this person is a saint, she will be in a
very bad state of mind!

The person put in this bad state of mind will not be able to think straight,
will act in a pissed off way and piss others off too.


This isn't useful to anyone.

But I suppose that if everyone in the world could be broad minded enough to
accept that their property (how ever they define it) is available for any
man, woman and child to take away and use in any manner ......oh what a nice
place this world could be (pass the sick bag)

That depends on two things, can you remove the implant easily (preferably by
yourself) and does my child want to submit to the process ?

Could a very powerful quantum computer in the future then compute numbers
we now consider to be noncomputible because they would require more bits
than all the particles in the universe? (I think such problems such as
computing all the routes between all the cities in the US would be in this
category). If such a computer is operating beyond the physical limits of
the universe, is it metaphysical? Is it doing metaphysical computing?
   Does "superposition" mean that it is doing more than one thing at
exactly the same time with exactly the same physical units? If so, that is
a metaphysical concept. This is something we have been talking about on
Robot-for-President in the context of whether a robot with an advanced
quantum robotic controller could be said to be "conscious". If so, how
would we know? If there is some operational way of proving that it is
doing something beyond physical capacity, it is by definition
metaphysical. Does "superposition" do that for us?
    I suppose one could then ask if metaphysical means conscious
or sentient. Also, in Charles Tart's text, "Altered States of
Consciousness" the expression "ineffable" keeps coming up. Sometimes these
altered states of consciousness are so extraordinary that people don't
have words adequate to describe them. They are ineffable. Sometimes I find
my own dream states to be that way. I know I have had an extraordinary
dream but when I try to describe it the words don't suffice and the dream
sort of fades away and is lost to memory. I guess my point is that even if
we can prove somehow that quantum robotic controllers have metaphysical
capabilities, that does not prove consciousness as we usually think of
consciousness. Maybe it doesn't prove consciousness at all.

OK here are some cases:
State ex rel Graham v. Cherry, No.
 M1999-01623-COA-R3-CV (Tennessee Court of Appeals, July 19,
2000): Upon the determination of paternity, the father of a child
born out of wedlock is statutorily liable for support from and after
the child's birth. Further, the juvenile court has the discretion to
order a retroactive support award back to that date, the amount
and method of payment to be determined by the juvenile judge in
light of the circumstances of the case and consistent with the
standards which normally govern the issuance of child support
orders. T.C.A. § 36-2-108(d). The father's liability is not
retroactive only to the date on which he knew for certain that he
was the child's father.

And what should make this an open and shut issue, read the following
page:

http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art199903.html
where:
The lesson one must take from S.F. v. T.M., however, is somewhat
troubling: a man is strictly liable for where his sperm  ends up even
when he unknowingly and involuntarily engages in a
sexual act. Instead of comparing the father's predicament with the
mother's predicament in Division of Child Support Enforcement ex
rel. Esther M. v. Mary L., No. 94-33812 (1994.DE.19031), where a
mother was relieved of her child support obligation because she
was raped, the court imposed a child support obligation because of
the fact of paternity. This can only be termed a strict liability
theory of sperm.

On the other hand, taking the example of artificial insemination, we see
that so long as the strictures of the UNIFORM STATUS OF CHILDREN OF
ASSISTED CONCEPTION ACT

http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/uscaca88.htm

which still says this about the parental status of consenting donors:
<<Present statutory law is split concerning the parental status of sperm
donors. Fifteen states have statutes, patterned after Section 5(b) of
the Uniform Parentage Act,
specifying that a donor will not be considered the father of a child
born of artificial insemination if the semen was provided to a licensed
physician for use in artificial
insemination of a married woman other than the donor's wife. Fifteen
other statutes do not explicitly limit nonparenthood to situations where
the semen is provided to
a physician. Instead, they shield donors from parenthood in all
situations where a married woman is artificially inseminated with her
husband's consent. >> (i.e. if the husband does not give his consent (or
rescinds his consent any time in the two years following the act of
insemination) then the donor, known or anonymous, is considered a
parent.

This is definitely a very grey area, however once cloning becomes
popular, I think that there will be some more definitive case law about
this particular issue, as women take the hair from a persons brush and
clones them without knowledge or consent...

According to a wire service report, John Stossel apologized Friday night on ABC's "20/20" for using inaccurate information in two earlier reports on the safety of organic food.  In the reports, aired in Febuary and again July 7th, Stossel said that organic food was no safer than regular food and warned that it could even be dangerous.  He reported that an examination of produce conducted for ABC News found that there was no pesticide residue on either conventional samples or organic ones.  After critics complained, ABC investigated the report and found that no such test had been done.  In other wouds, Stossel lied to us about it.  In his apology, he said, "All we have in this business is our credibility - your trust that we get it right.  I'll make every effort to see it never happens again."

Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
that a woman can always get out of the
responsibility for a child (before birth by
aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
adoption), while a man can literally be held
responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
just because he was careless enough not to use a
rubber, or because a woman's birth control method
did not work or because he was lied to? ("Yes
honey, I'm on the pill.") Fair is fair. If women
legally don't have to support their kids, men
shouldn't have to either. 

I'm gay, but if I were a heterosexual man the
prospect of having sex with any woman would
greatly concern me for these reasons.

Its a curiously constitutional 'separate but equal' situation, where the
man is considered to be exercising his reproductive rights when he
decides whether or not to drop his drawers, while the woman exercises
them during pregnancy as well as when she decides to drop her drawers.
Personally, if the man was lied to, then the woman should either be
forced to either abort, OR accept the father's dissolution of rights and
support. That is a perfectly fair reproductive choice to make. Of
course, I'm sure this is gonna piss off at least a few of the women on
the list. I personally think that the lack of application of consent
here is a major legal hole.

Remember, the unit can allegedly be inactivated by the
wearer. Would units for children still have that
feature? If you were willing to have this unit placed
in your child in the first place, then the age of the
child may dictate whether an inactivation feature were
made available. Maybe a child-proof inactivation
switch of some kind would work.

I don't have children, but I would definitely consider
one for my infant, especially if there were medical
issues.

I'll probably consider one for myself primarily
because it's a great idea for cryonicists who fear
croaking in their sleep and lying there for a couple
days before anyone finds out. I want the ALCOR team at
my side as soon as possible.

Ok, regarding dynamic ip's.  Then your typical ISP's IP number is fixed for the
first three sequences:  123.345.132.xxx    where .xxx is the dynamic part unique
to each user logged into at the time???

Thanks Mike for answering my 'stupid' question.  I suppose if I value my

Now, with cloning, you being gay doesn't exempt you from these concerns
at all (moreover, in the case I previously cited, a man passed out at a
party at a womans house from being drunk, woke up with no clothes on,
and the woman admitted to people she had sex with him while passed out,
yet he was still held liable for support. So it really doesn't matter if
you are straight or gay.) If a woman decides you are just the sort of
person she wants to raise as a child, and she snags some of your hair
from your hairbrush or off the toilet (now we know why gays are so
fastidious! ;) ) and has you cloned and is impregnated with that embryo,
without your knowledge, do we apply the standard of the guy who was
passed out, or the standard of the woman who was raped to your
situation???

*sigh*  Women should not be able to get out of the responsibility of a 
possible pregnancy that comes with having sex.  Neither should men.  We
should be making women accountable rather than removing the accountability
from men.  The possibility of pregnancy should always be taken into
account when engaging in heterosexual intercourse, even if contraception
*is* being used, because nothing is failsafe.  And if you're having sex
with someone you can't trust enough to be honest about their reproductive
status, then you have more problems than those related to being stuck with
childcare payments.

So, how 'bout it?  Anyone want to get into an abortion debate?


Didn't think so.

The problem here is that such a thing could become compulsory.  The problem with a
transparent society are twofold.

One, there is no guarantee that everyone will be equally transparent.  I see it as
perfectly reasonable that only the rich will afford privacy, making it instead a
totalitarian nightmare.  If it's not equal across the board then its tyranny,
because it gives a select few unequal advantage. The same could be said of guns
(ouch!  sorry to bring this up again).  If disarmament is not omni-lateral, then
those with the guns make the rules - period.

Secondly, assuming a transparent society becomes completely omni-lateral, instead
of everyone being forced to tolerate everyone else's ideosynchrocies, a backlash
could happen where societies norms are even more oppressive, as everyone is forced
to "behave"  in the what was the sanctuary of their once private homes.  Imagine
loosing that great job you've had for 5 years when your prudish boss finds you
like a little S&M on occasion.

Until I see proof that transparency fosters a more liberated society, I'm not
buying this crap anymore.

Dear Franklin,

A great deal of discussion of this topic has happened on this list over the last four years.  If you
start looking around in the archives at http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/ you can follow many
ineffable and qualiatative threads.  Unfortunately, the threads are not indexed very well, so you are
on your own.

No one understands, yet, exactly what is going on at the quantum level.  We have plenty of
experimental data that allow us to infer some rules, and we have made the "Standard Model" which has
worked well for the last 20 years.  As we make models that have predictive power, we gain the ability
to use quantum properties to make devices.  Whatever is happening at the tiny scale of quantum
mechanics, is happening in the physical universe, it is just that at the scale of our daily lives the
physical universe looks much, much, simpler than it really is.  It turns out that reality is stranger
(and richer) than metaphysics, so who needs metaphysics.

-Ken

See William Farrell's book, "The Myth of Male Power"
for a discussion of this and other alleged inequities.
 Following is part of the Amazon.com review:

--------------

"Through numerous short-take paragraphs,
Farrell--armed with hundreds of thoroughly documented
statistics and legal citings--argues that men are
oppressed by several ``glass cellars,'' among them war
(in which it's mainly men who die); suicide (``A
husband whose wife dies is about ten times more likely
to commit suicide than a wife whose husband dies'');
and ``the death professions'' (``The Jobs Related
Almanac...found that twenty-four of the twenty-five
worst jobs were almost-all-male jobs''). He emphasizes
that women live, on average, seven years longer than
men, and that men's health issues, unlike women's, are
basically ignored. He contends that women's net worth
exceeds men's, and that economic power, if measured by
spending rather than by earning, belongs primarily to
women (``Both sexes buy more for women''). Farrell
accuses government of becoming a ``substitute
husband'' through welfare and through discriminating
in favor of women in cases of murder, sexual
harassment, and rape;"

-------------------------

Unfortunately, this book usually precipitates more
dissension than dialogue.

I dont' recall off the top of my head, but I do know that when you are
using chat software, like MS Chat, and you bring up a list of all users
on the chat server, there is usually a column for their IP addy.
Anything that is not strictly a set of four numbers (###.###.###.###) is
a dynamic IP addy. Now, people using high speed connections, like DSL,
T-1, etc get static IP addys that are permanently theirs, and which you
can run a trace route straight to when tracking down. Of course, I could
be calling into my home system from anywhere, either over the net via an
anonymizer, or via a dial up connection into my machine over normal
phone lines. If I use the second type, I can still use dozens of PBX
systems to skip my calls off of before it goes to my home system or ISP. 

What is a PBX? Its a commercial phone system, like at a doctor's or
dentist's office (like Merlin). Doctors and dentists are especially
vulnerable (as are lawyers and accountants) because they like to put as
much of their personal expenses on office equipment as possible, so when
they finish checking their office voicemail, they will press a key to
get the PBX to hang up and give them a dial tone. THing is that the dial
tone is on the PBX, not the persons local phone, so any long distance
calls made in this manner are on the PBX billing, not the bill for the
local phone (which is good if you are calling from a payphone or if your
cellphone long distance rates are sky high). If you ever saw the movie
"Sneakers", where they bounced calls all over the country before trying
to crack into a company system, this is how hackers use PBX systems to
anonymize themselves, because it takes a dedicated tracer to track down
someone who is doing this, and each leg of the chain gives you x amount
of time before they trace the place that call is calling from. Call up
one PBX, get a dial tone, call another PBX from there, get a dial tone,
etc.. for as many legs as you thing are necessary for security.

Prof. Brown's article makes a number of good points about the premature 
release of any GMO into the natural environment.  Our level of understanding 
concerning chromosome structure and gene regulation is detailed but far from 
complete.  Our depth of knowledge cannot encompass every possible risk that 
there is.  One example is the failed attempt to modify tryptophan to speed up 
it's production.  That resulted in a number of deaths and 1,500 people being 
paralyzed.  That was after USFDA approval of the product.  Although I firmly 
believe in the genetic modification of life I also see that if there are 
initial failed attempts that result in fatalities then the general public is 
going to be vehement towards any further pursuit of that research.  Stricter 
guidelines should be enacted so that we can see the benefit of more important 
research later.  Trees that take in more CO2 and clean up pollutants.  Grains 
that contain a more complete array of proteins and vitamins.  The last thing 
genetic research needs is more enemies.

I don't think every unplanned pregnancy was because "the man was
lied to" by the woman. I find it peculiar that you would explain away two
consenting adults with such a devious explanation. (I doubt that most
 situations are due to such Jerry Springer antics)The two parties both
participated in the risk,(and everyone does know the risks, both man and
woman) There are many reasons that an unwanted pregnancy could result.
No, I don't believe it would be fair to force an abortion on a woman
(physical,
and emotional trauma) and I highly doubt that abortions will ever be forced
on anyone (excluding medical emergency, which still isn't forced). Legally,
that's just not going to take. Your other 'alternative/choice" is that if a
woman
refuses abortion, that she should then take care of the child, (who is
indeed
his as well) while he shouldn't have to contribute emotional or financial
responsibility.


Of course, I'm sure this is gonna piss off at least a few of the women on

Funny you should say that (about to puke) your reasonable (in pure
jest) 'resolution' of such a situation is shockingly selfish, not only in
leaving all consequences on the female of the -two- who took the risk,
but for the child as well. It's as if your scenario implies she had sex with
herself. (I smell cop out)

Yes, Kazinski is like Mao, Marx, Lenin, or Jesus H Christ to these
people, and his Manifesto is widely read and has seemed to be the
trigger incident for the formation of this movement beyond the west
coast EarthFirsters...

Your argument is essentially that since we can't stop everyone from doing
it, we shouldn't even try.  Clearly then we should stop prosecuting
murderers as well, since it's obvious that murders continue, despite our
efforts to prevent them.  Fortunately, despite the fact that absolute
security may be impossible, we are sufficiently flexible to understand that
it is more desirable to strive towards security than to reliquish all
attempts to control the situation.

I find this "it's impossible, don't bother" mentality to be bothersome in
the general population, but even more so amongst supposed transhumans-- In
some ways I feel that we ought to determine what is -desirable- and then
move towards making it happen.  Every generation is filled with the
nay-sayers who say such and such is impossible, despite the seemingly
endless historical evidence of progession.

In fact, I would love to call a moratorium on the "it's impossible, don't
bother," argument-- why not try arguing the case of the basis of whether it
is desirable and leave your inability to imagine innovative solutions at the
door.

There are numerous examples of humans imposing arbitrary order upon a system
in order to exert a desirable influence over it.  In my opinion, government
is simply a form of social technology, and a powerful tool in our arsenal.

Those damn irrational Wright brothers.  Didn't they know that it had been

Ah yes, "get used to it and get over it," the rallying cry of the
pessimistic inevitablist.




Good thing that a bunch of smart people on this planet decided to try to
exert some influence over our reality despite its apparent inevitability.
Instead of shrugging and saying: "Hey, we can't stop Frank from chopping
down Roger's plum tree and setting his barn on fire, so let's not bother,"
they figured they'd whip up some aribitrary social contracts to control
undesirable individual behavior.


Ugh.

I fear that the attacks of the neoluddites are going to cause this to happen,
and thereby, produce exactly what they are trying to prevent.  Research driven
out of the light of day will go on in secret.  Secrecy tends to promote abuse,
and widen the gap between those with control of powerful technologies, and those
who have not.  Next comes a major accident because proper safeguards were pushed
to the side, causing the technological haves and have nots to each harden their
positions and to try to polarize as much of the population as possible.  We live
in interesting times.

Ah, there's the rub.  Why are so many people so mentally/philosophically
challenged at the prospect of negotiating a non-absolute line of compromise
between these two concepts?

I assume that you have not been following the discussion to date, so
I'll let the snide commentary slide. I was in no way assuming that every
unplanned pregnancy is because the man was 'lied to'. In cases, however,
where there is a clear situation of fraud on the part of the  woman, if
not outright force (and female rapes of males do occur, both statutorily
and between adults, as the previously cited case of the passed out male
shows), then the male should have the EXACT same option to either
terminate the pregnancy or be exempted from parental
responsibilities/support as women do who have been lied to or raped.
Insisting on anything more biased is plainly sexist.

They made a movie of it?  i wonder if the movie was anything similar to the
book.  I read the book while in High School in the sixties.  It was hot
stuff at the time but (as always) rather tame now.

I'm in favor of implants...not necessarily ID implants though (unless it
suites my purposes)....I want implants that augment my capabilities.  Like
mike mentioned some time ago....the road to a "soft" upload.....

The thing I like about this is that it's a step in the right direction.

However the tracking function can be a problem.  A few years ago tracking
devices were initiated on some trucks....i had one and I hated
it.....primarily because the overeducated moron at the other end of the link
had no clue as to the real conditions i was facing when he commanded that I
do such and such.  I got rather ingenious in disabling the tracking
function.

Now Big Brother wants to mandate something similar on all commercial
vehickles.  I dissaprove....

Ahhh Grasshopper:
Dualist and Monist-subjectivist philosophies constitute metaphysics IMO. I
also think we can substitute "general scientific theories" for these names,
going by Runes Dictionary of Philosophy and its definition of philosophy as
"the most general science".
So these two theories posit that in theory one can hold numbers and their
calculations in mind by "mentalist" methods, without recourse to physical
computing. I am then the thinker and not the thought and always will be so.
A thought can be defined physically as is done in AI. The thinker is
metaphysical and always has the capacity to form thoughts at a level higher
than the physical. You might call that a "creative" power.
And quoting Genesis, man was FORMED from the dust of the earth like the
animals but CREATED in God's image and likeness. Watson's seminal 1913 ms in
"Psych Review" put an end to MENTALISM they said but isn't it ironic that
psychologists who reject mentalism still call that which is assessed by IQ
testing and related abilities, "MENTAL Ability"? So there is thinking and
meta-thinking; intelligence and meta-intelligence. And maybe the
Grasshoppers of Quantum Mechanics are catching up now. And as for me? I
dream of turning BC into "Happy Honda Land" by setting up a Honda Dealership
which will sell P3's and beyond with quantum robotic controllers.
If Hameroff is right I already have a quantum controller on my shoulders.

My Honda is erratic

Ah, yes, and _Logan's Run_, and _Absolute Power_, and innumerable SF
novels based on the premise.  Only dogs and slaves wear collars. I can

Exactly!  Of course, in some cases, one might not be able to do more than
just see the defects.  But if it's something where a process produces
variable outputs -- as with manufactureing microchips -- it might be a case
of seeing the defects and rejecting the outputs that fall below a certain
threshold.  With nanoscale detection * one would certainly be able to do
this.  This would be especially important in critical components or
components that fail at a high rate because of their structure.

To be precise here, I'm not talking about nanoassemblers -- nanotech that
reproduces -- but about non-nanotech that produces nanotech.  To some
extent, we have this now.  People are already building nanoscale structures.
Since we don't yet have true nanoassemblers, we can still, I believe build a
lot of useful nanostructures and even devices with current technology.

The real trick is being able to produce such things in such a way as to make
a profit and, hopefully, further progress along.  (I think if nanotech
structures make it out of the lab now, it will signal investors to put more
funding into the work as well as bring the stuff into everyday life.)

*  I prefer this over "nanoscope," as that term implies something akin to a
microscope albeit smaller.  In fact, nanoscale detection might be something
as simple and crude as making the defective item or process change color
change so that we can detect the problem output at a macroscale.  E.g., if
defective microchips changed to dayglow green, we be able to pick them out
of the batch.  Crude but effective, no?

I smell a business plan in here.  It is very hard to make money in farming (I
have watched my eldest sister try to do so for 40 years).  However, I suspect
someone could make a bundle by providing secure farm facilities to the GMO
research companies.  That way they can subcontracting out this problem.  The
grower could charge them 100x what it would cost to grow the crops on ordinary
farms, but they would be glad to pay it to be out of this loop, and have their
investment secure.

As I indicated in an earlier post, this would be ripe for abuse.  I suspect
that in the name of security, the grower would not reveal the farm locations
to the researchers, but just show some kind of meeting specifications.  This
means someone who almost, but not quite, understands the possible interactions
puts the farm in a place "safe" from the neoluddites, but not safe from the
kind of environmental dangers that only the brightest of the researchers can
understand.  The GMO company would claim that they were not accountable for
where the subcontractor put the farm.

I do not think it is a good thing, but if subcontract high security GMO
growers were on the Idea Futures, I would buy some.

You believe that freedom is an absolute?  Don't you think, for instance,
that one can be free to do certain things and not free to do others?  Can't
we be simultaneously free and not-free?

I think the insistence that one is either 100% free or 100% enslaved is
rudimentary and a poor model to describe the actual interactions of complex
individuals.  In fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to describe a scenario
in which an individual is 100% free (which it appears one must be in order
to be defined as free at all by your interpretation?)  I agree that we
cannot have a society that is both -100%- safe and -100%- free-- the two
qualities necessarily impose upon each other.  The balance we need to strike
instead is of finding an acceptable compromise-- we pay for security with
the currency of our freedom.

The dilemma of massively destructive technologies is the need for
overwhelming security in the face of individual power.  I do not relish the
prospect of an absolute police state.

I thought they were urban legends until one really happened on the lake
I lived on last year. During the winter, a guy was doing construction
work with a bulldozer at a house on one side of the lake, and in the
evening, would drive the bulldozer across the lake on the ice so he
could do some work at his house on the opposite shore. One monday, after
a rather warm weekend, he went to drive the dozer home, and went over an
area where there was apparently a spring in the lake bottom, cause the
ice was thinner, and the bulldozer sunk down 30 feet and the guy
drowned. When I heard about it on the radio, I was riding to work on the
bus, since my jeep was in the garage. I said to the driver,"Boy, that
guy has to be the biggest moron in the Upper Valley", at which point a
woman riding the bus piped up,"he was my brother-in-law, and he was NOT
retarded!". I replied,"Ma'am, I didn't say he was retarded, I said he
was a moron, there is a difference", and went back to reading my
newspaper.... ;)

Roger that.  This would be for volunteers only, which leaves out prisoners
and cons, and even kids, should they have an objection.  Actually, now
that you mention it, I wonder if we could offer it to prisoners, so they
can get outta jail if they accept the implant?  Then they would be
volunteers in a sense.  spike

The reasonable limits on freedom are where they conflict with the
freedoms of other individuals, the old "your right to swing your fist
ends at my nose" routine. The problem today is that this is not seen as
the boundary anymore. The boundary is now seen as that point at which
other people feel safe to have you around, usually this mandates that
jack booted government goons be the ones to make sure they do feel safe.
This is not freedom.  Just as I say a part time slavery to the
government is morally no different than a full time slavery to other
individuals, you cannot be partly free. Limits to your freedom based on
the freedoms of others does not enslave you. Limits placed on your
freedom for the benefit of the government, or for peoples perception of
safety, that is slavery, no matter what degree you those limits are.
100% free is when all individuals are equally 100% free, and government
is acting its proper part as our servant. When a government agent has
more rights than you do, you are no longer free.

But all the bosses I know looove S+M.  Well, at least the S part.  {8^D

You bring up a good point however.  As society becomes more transparent,
the prudish must be displaced from positions of power, replaced by the
tolerant and cool.  This is kinda already happened in the Silicon Valley,

Exactly my thoughts; a step in the right direction...
This particular gizmo and its uses aside, imho the
most important thing about it is the trend of progress
in which it represents a move ahead. I can't wait to
see what follows... Wahoo! I needed some good news

Well, they say it's easy to disable the tracking
function of this thing. And it seems to be intended
for somewhat different purposes than the truck
tracking device.

I've expressed my severe reservations about this project before.  Nothing 
this big has ever been built before & the cost boggles the mind.  The thing 
just doesn't look like it could possibly be strong enough to keep from 
breaking its back from wave action and the "high rise" hull looks like a 
great big wave-catcher.  When you consider that the price of the housing 
they're offering compares unfavorably with San Francisco and Silicon Valley 
real estate prices . . . it looks like a pipe dream to me.

The whole issue was debated for a while on the Randian-Feminism list (run by

that means it's solved, but the archives of that list might prove helpful
here.

The danger with this approach is that it tends to overlook the costs of
your enforcement tools.  The point I see the anti-IP people making is
that intellectual property rights are inherently difficult to enforce
because IP is so distributed.  With regular property you can hope to
put a guard on what you own, but with IP, you want to both distribute
it and control it.  This requires that you have some kind of "guard"
that can go along with each copy.  It's tough to do when IP is just
information and so easily copied.

So the reality is that IP is different from other forms of property.
If you rule out discussions of this difference in terms of looking
at desirability, you overlook much of the big picture.  Maybe you can
control IP, but only at the cost of, for example, disallowing encryption.
(David Brin seemed to me to be taking this view in early drafts of
his book on transparency.)  Or you need to make it illegal to reverse
engineer copyright protection systems, like the controversial DMCA law
which is being used to shut down the Linux DVD players.  Such proposals
have significant costs.

In my view, you can't ignore the reality of the difficulties of
controlling IP and just focus on how desirable it would be if you could.
If IP were just like regular property, probably everyone would agree that
it should be controlled in the same way.  Most people here are fervent
advocates of property rights.  It is only because it is different that
some are calling for different treatment.

I agree that it is an overstatement to say that controlling IP is
"impossible".  We don't know yet what will and will not be possible.
No doubt a sufficiently Draconian, invasive and universal political
system would allow for control of IP.  But in terms of our understanding
of the technical issues, it appears that controlling many forms of IP
will be difficult and costly to achieve.  Ultimately it is these costs
which are driving the proposals for rethinking how we manage IP.

You might want to revisit John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier's excellent
analysis of the technical difficulties facing IP control systems at
http://www.counterpane.com/street_performer.html.

Evangelical Christians will consider this an early harbinger of the rule of the Antichrist which they believe is coming.  I will be interested to see to what extent they protest this technology.  

I also wonder how fast it well be till tyrannical gov'ts institute this technology by force to closely monitor dissidents?  How much will the world protest this?

I am so convinced of the benefits of transparency, that I'd certainly 
consider being one of the guinea pigs in order to get the ball rolling.  In 
fact, a few weeks back I was seriously considering rigging up webcams 
throughout the house and leaving them connected to the web 24/7.  Couldn't 
convince the wife though (like me she likes to run around less than fully 
clad).

So instead, I'll be setting up a cam in my office so she (or anyone else 
who's interested) can watch me while I work :)  Still shopping for a webcam. 
  I'll let you know when its up and running.

Agreed.  Many people reflexively assume that it is “fair” to allow content 
providers to monopolize their creations, yet at the same time exploit them 
for perpetual financial gain.  Is it “fair” for me to be able to write a 
song in half an hour, and reap royalty payments from it for the rest of my 
life, while the next guy spends half a year building a house and sells it 
for a one time payment, never to see another dime from his investment?

I wonder if this could be the 21st century equivalent of the Titanic?  In ten years will we read of it sinking with thousands drowned?

I read Mike's story about the man who drove the heavy equipment across the lake with fatal results with interest.  He may not have been stupid but simply a risk-taker who liked pushing his luck.  And he died for it...

In Alaska we had a famous case of a young man in his early twenties who came up after graduating from a nice east coast college.  He was seen as brilliant but somewhat eccentric and private by his few friends.  This fellow moved into a broken down schoolbus in the wilds of Alaska during the late fall.  He gave away much of the food supplies he had originally gotten for the trip!  

Snow came and his food ran out.  He was many miles from other people and not sure of his way around.  He simply stayed holed up in the van and slowly starved to death.  About a week after he died a pair of hunters came across the bus and found his dead body. 

A bestselling book was written about what happened.  It was a good read and showed a troubled soul who thought he could find himself in the wilds of Alaska.  I'm not sure to what extent he was "an idiot" for not planning ahead or simply had a unconcious death wish.  He left messages behind saying he did want to live.  Some folks just don't have any common sense I guess!

sincerely,

John

If either of you actually desire to do the legal research, you can get free 
case law online at:

http://www.jurisline.com or http://www.lexisone.com/

Happy hunting.  BTW, I am not a family lawyer, but I'm pretty sure what you 
will find is there is no "bright line" rule.  I know there have been cases 
where men have been held financially responsible for kids that have been 
conclusively proven *not* to be biologically theirs.

I also know there have been cases involving biological (surrogate) mothers 
claiming parental rights to the children they bore for other parents, and I 
believe that in at least one such case the birth mother was denied parental 
rights.  But, like I say, I don't think there is any one rule that will 
apply across the board.  Like most family law cases, the rules are pretty 
lax and the judge has a great deal of leeway to do what he or she feels is 
in the "best interests of the child."

Being a hetero man (and one who was once falsely accused of fathering a 
child out of wedlock), your comments strike a chord with me.  However, I 
think the current state of affairs is the lesser of two evils.  If men were 
able to say "OK, I fathered this child, but I want nothing to do with it, 
and refuse to financially support it," I think that would impose an 
unconscionable hardship upon single mothers and fatherless kids.  No matter 
what, its not the kids fault and the kid deserves to be provided for.  If 
not by his dad, then by the state, which vicariously makes *me* (as a tax 
payer) financially responsible for his kid.  Thanks but no thanks.

So, yeah it might be rough on fathers of unwanted kids.  But, hey, if you're 
a man who does not want to have kids there are ways to avoid it.  If you are 
careless, or get duped, or are just terribly unlucky, them's the breaks.  
When you get trimmed, just consider potential fatherhood one of the 
potential costs.

I don't see it that way.  If only the rich and powerful were able to avoid 
transparency, then that would truly be an Orwellian dystopia.  But how long 
would you sit still for that state of affairs?  I am the *biggest* 
transparency advocate I know.  But if transparency only applied to the weak 
and/or poor, I would join in the revolution against the regime arm in arm 
with the likes of Mike Lorrey and fight to the death.  I have a feeling Mike 
and I would not be alone.

Again, I don't see it that way.  I think once transparency is in place it 
will become apparent just how mainstream many "alternative" lifestyles are.  
There's an S&M club in Hollywood I've been to a few times and its not just 
the leather clad and heavily-tattooed-and-pierced who are in attendance.  
There are lots of folks who look like they could be your neighbor (or even 
your boss) who are there gettin' their spank on.  I believe we will come to 
view all manner of alternative pastimes just as most people now view 
homosexuality: "It's not my bag, but if it floats your boat, more power to 
ya!"

This is the problem-- your perceived benefits of transparency don't accrue
to everyone.

I agree that there are challenges to be faced.  I also agree that the costs
of controlling the information are very relevant.  This is the sort of
discussion I think people should be having-- cost vs. benefit, i.e.:
arguments from desirability.  My complaint was against the argument from
impossibility, i.e.: it doesn't even matter if we want to, 'cause we can't.

Well, I would argue that desirability IS the big picture and includes
weighing these factors.


  Maybe you can

DISallowing encryption?  On the contrary, encryption is a very good thing
for IP.  I'm in favor of all sorts of meta-information that add rules and
intelligence to our data.

Or you need to make it illegal to reverse

Exactly.  Again, this is an argument regarding desirability.  How much money
are we willing to spend to protect an industry? (And can't we find ways for
that industry to pay for it's own protection?  Can we ensure that the
industry as a whole is exothermic?)  How much freedom are we willing to
relinquish to preserve security?  IMO the best path invariably lies
somewhere in the gray area between the two extremes.  It appears to me that
some people have problems with this-- thus the prevalence of the slippery
slope argument: "Oh, first you want to be able to own your own book, next, I
won't be able to look at you without paying you."  Our ability to proceed in
the face of apparent ambiguity speaks to a flexible intellect comfortable in
navigating the increasing intricacies of our reality.

I agree.  But 'different' treatment is not 'no' treatment.

Yes.  We probably can't expect to have absolute control over it-- much like
we don't have absolute control over a human's ability to kill another.
Instead, we find a way to operate within acceptable parameters.  Let me
change a single word in your above sentence:  "No doubt a sufficiently
Draconian, invasive and universal political system would allow for control
of murder."  I think you'll agree that this sentence is not a good argument
against attempting to legislate against murders at -all.-


  But in terms of our understanding

Good.  Actually, this is precisely why I am quite optimistic about how
things turn out.  Rules on the sharing and distribution of property create
markets, and market pressures are "a good thing" and a sensitivity to costs
tends to lead to increasing fitness.  The selection pressure in this
environment is towards nimble, smart, economical protection of data.  This
has so many other spin-off benefits that it makes me tingle just to say the
phrase "nimble, smart, economical protection of data."  :)

Cool... I'd do that. (Can't, though, even if given the
opportunity. Not for a few years yet. Which ought to
hopefully work out with the timing of the next
generation's general availability...)

There was a hilarious storyline in Doonesbury (I
think) a month or two ago, about that girl streaming
webcam images of her room on a website, and she'd use
the "people are watching!" thing to talk her dad into
agreeing to stuff because he was worried about being
seen being mean by the viewers.

Yeah, I'd like to know the URL :-)

For another look at the future challenges to IP, see
http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000813mag-boombox.html.
(US people can register for free.  Try cpunks/cpunks if you like.)

This talks about TiVo and Replay, the new "personal video recorders"
which save TV shows on disk and let you watch them whenever you like.
The article predicts that these things will be the same kind of threat
to TV that Napster is to the music business.  The problem is, these
systems allow you to skip past commercials.  If they catch on, the whole
financial basis for the TV industry would be in jeapordy.

The article goes on to suggest that the solution ultimately will
be advertising so targetted that people will _want_ to see the ads.
The only way for this to work is for the advertisers (or at least some
part of the advertisement-delivering machinery) to know a lot about your
tastes and preferences.  TiVo and similar systems might allow this kind
of information gathering.

Theoretically, everyone wins.  Advertisers present their ads to people
who are maximally receptive to their message, and viewers see ads about
the very products they are most interested in.

However there seem to be flaws in this tidy picture.  If people really
want to see the ads, why should the advertisers pay for expensive TV
programming to wrap around them?  Normally the only way they can get you
to watch ads is by putting them in shows.  If you actually liked the ads,
there's no reason for the advertisers to pay for the shows.

Also, as the article mentions, much advertising doesn't fit into this
model.  Everyone buys toilet paper, but most people aren't going to be
eager to see ads for it.  The nature of advertising may change as only
certain kinds of products can be presented in an appealing way.

I wonder if the industry will try to pass some kind of laws to preserve
the status quo in the same way that the music and movie people have done.

I think a bigger problem would be proving that someone really has no
responsibility here.

Also, I think there's an implication in most heterosexual sexual encounters
that the goal is pleasure or affection -- not reproduction.  So, isn't there
an implied contract here?

If society were so disposed as to side with Mark here -- making it totally
the mother's responsibility -- do you really think that women would just
produce more fatherless children?  Or would the incentive be either to
abstain, use birth control (either partner), or practice sex which is less
likely or unlikely to lead to pregnacy (such as oral sex)?

That said, I don't think too many women just squeeze out babies and assume
the father will take care of them.  I did work with one, however, who got
pregnant quite frequently, then would get abortions, and repeat the same
thing again after recovering.  (I don't know if her strategy was just to
live carefree without birth control or if she was just trying to hook a guy,
then when the guy didn't want to get hooked, terminated the pregnancy.)

I agree here, but I think the question, who should be held accountable?

Get rid of tax funding of this stuff and you won't be a vicarious father.
Notably, when welfare in NJ no longer paid extra for more children, the
birth rate of welfare mothers went down.

Another example of a massive con job.  Given that introducing more money 
into the stream merely causes the prices of everything to rise, these 
wonderful philanthropic efforts do MUCH, MUCH less in general to raise the 
general welfare than simply reinvesting the money directly into production 
or valuable R & D, which actually results in a net increase in wealth.  In 
most cases, misguided or con-artiste charity for publicity purposes merely 
redistributes the resources from the productive to the most unproductive.  
Bread and circuses...  Too bad they couldn't spend the money fixing the 
thousands of Windows bugs.

Not logical to lump protesters against genetic engineering in with Luddites, 
who are anti-computer and against ALL technology.  Yet it appears to be easy 
to do.
This crap is just feeding the hysteria which circulates around this issue. I 
wish I had not read this post. 

I am still researching genetically engineered food, and though highly 
optimistic about its features, I am also aware that the ethical issues and 
planetary and economic consequences are almost as complicated as those 
surruonding nanotechnology. 

Though of course I am pro-technology, I am not blind to the downsides, and  I 
refuse judge either side, avid pro-gens, or the raving anti-gens.

Both have points that are valid, and both sides should avoid raving, foaming 
posts.

I'm not sure to what extent he was "an idiot" for not planning ahead or simply had a unconcious death wish.  He left messages behind saying he did want to live.  Some folks just don't have any common sense I guess!

Actually, readers of the book would see that he did not actually die of
starvation directly, but innoctuously poisoned himself with an alkaloid
from a wild plant that was very similar to one he regularly lived on in
the wild in the southern 48. The alkaloid prevented his system from
digesting anything, so no matter how much he ate (and he shot a moose
and ate many wild plants, so he was not starving) it didn't get into his
system.

This young guy, dont remember his name, did not come up to Alaska after
graduating college, but after several years of living in the wilderness
in the lower 48. While many did think he was politically naive and
emotionally immature, he was a skilled outdoorsman and knew how to keep
himself alive.

I don't seem to understand. Why should Zero let someone else have any
choice in whether they have privacy or not? If he is a man of his

Its not permanent.  Seems like if people can get hold of
any kind of dope they want, there should be ways to get
a blood pressure medication.  I have a doctor who is

The notion is that as transparency increases, people are ever more
motivated to overthrow tyrannical governments.  If *every* action
is open to the light of day, then anything that does not
directly harm another person is legal, moral and ethical.  True
freedom is not getting away with something that is illegal [but shouldnt be.]
True freedom is not having a bunch of stupid laws.

Mike Lorrey et.al, think over this deal for a minute.  What if...
EVERYTHING that anyone does is visible to everyone.  In
return, YOU get to make the laws.  Design a system that will
work under those circs, including a means of paying the few
cops that will likely still be needed, etc, a prison system for
the dangerous few that still desperately need imprisonment, etc.

Medics?  What is this stuff?  My next door neighbor told me about
it, as he was on it for blood pressure but learned that it was defeating
his efforts to sire a litter.  Ill find out the name of the medication and
get back with you on it.  Its some kind of potassium blocker?  I
understand sperm need potassium in order to do their spermly thing.

According to an article in Sunday's L.A. Times, embryonic stem cell
research is close to getting some major funding.  Though the article itself
has some obvious negative bias, the facts themselves are quite a positive
and refreshing change from the anti-biotech, inhibitory undertakings we
have read so much about lately.

	interesting ... perhaps we do not want to make certain things
known because we can not make them known completely. that is, i want to
hide the fact that i did action x because certain people can not fully
understand why and under what circumstances i did it; conversely, if all
my circumstances and intentions were completely understood, i would lose
the motivation to hide anything (presumably, the motivation for hiding
being shame, guilt, etc.). 

	i think this may well be the direction in which we are ultimately
moving. when we are all powers and become completely rational, perhaps we
will also choose to be completely transparent. however, i doubt that our
human brains were evolved to handle this kind of transparency. shame,
guilt, and indeed deception, are hardwired into the wetware. not only will
much energy be expanded to get society to the point of transparency, but
much energy will also be required to maintain transparency once we reach
it -- it is an uphill battle all the way, an unstable point in the phase
space of possible strategies. ultimately, transparency may cost more than
it can repay us, at least until we can change ourselves.

I forgot to mention in my previous post (or maybe someone else
did.. I'm not on the list) that "epsilon something" is a very common
name for a star- being typically the approx. 4th brightest star in a
stellar constellation (alpha- 1st brightest, beta- 2nd, delta- 3rd,
epsilon- 4th...). For example, alpha Lyrae is the brightest star
in the constellation Lyrae.

So much for "Yet every legal precedent in the country states that ultimately
it is
the biological parents who are responsible for their biological
children."

You should have made me work for it.  Not that I would have!  However, it
was nice of you to shoot yourself in the foot for me.  Need a bandage?

Actually, I'm glad that when I pushed you just a little, you turned out to
be intellectually honest.  My opinion of you just went up a notch.

Ta,

Online pharmacies in other counties will fill any drug order, with or
without a prescription.

I've used one in Greece and another in New Zealand.

Anybody want a url?

In a sidestep move that failed to leave the Pope floundering helplessly,
Aussie researchers have just announced a new advance in the casuistic war
over the sanctity of blastocyts and other small but perfectly formed
identical sacred lifeforms.

I'll be interviewed alongside Dr Trounson tonight on a radio show, so I
hope I can ferret out some more details on how fast cloned replacement
organs can be forced to grow - faster than 16 years to maturity, one would
hope.

=============
MEDIA RELEASE

14 August 2000

THERAPEUTIC CLONING BREAKTHROUGH

Embryonic stem cell experts at the Monash Institute of Reproduction and
Development have taken another important step in the quest to develop
therapeutic cloning techniques for the treatment of diseases like
Alzheimers, Parkinsons and diabetes.

Therapeutic cloning involves culturing stem cells in the laboratory that
could become replacement nerves and organs to overcome a range of
devastating illnesses.  

Earlier this year the team at Monash Institute announced that they were the
first in the world to grow nerve cells in the laboratory.

The next stage in the development of this therapy is to grow these cells
using a patient's own DNA, so that when introduced to the body, the immune
system will not reject them.

In another world first the Monash team has proven this theory using a mouse
model.  The scientists have established cloned mouse stem cell lines which
have the potential to grow into any type of mouse cell.

"This is an important development and proof of principle of therapeutic
cloning theory," said Professor Alan Trounson, Deputy Director of the
Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development.

"Much important research is still needed before we can take this treatment
to the public however this model is an important step that brings together
the specialised skills of the team at Monash Institute," said Professor
Trounson.

Monash PhD student, Ms Megan Munsie, has removed the genetic material or
DNA from an unfertilised mouse egg.  She has replaced it with the nucleus
or DNA of another developed cell from a "target mouse".  This insertion of
a nucleus from a developed or differentiated cell "fertilizes" the egg by
introducing two complete sets of chromosomes.  

"An embryo is grown for several days to blastocyst stage," explains Ms
Munsie. "Stem cells are then removed from the embryo and cultured in the
laboratory."   

"These stem cells have the same genetic make up as the original target
mouse and therefore if we were to program the cells to become a specific
body type, theoretically they could be introduced to the target mouse to
treat illnesses," said Ms Munsie.

This study is being published in the August edition of Current Biology.

The commercial partner for this research is Australian biotechnology
company, Stem Cell Sciences.

I'm sitting here late at night gazing at my unread books, having
finished Zubrin's "Entering Space" (very good in those areas where
Zubrin confines himself to aerospace engineering, interesting
when he crosses over into anthropology or psychology and poor
when he gets into areas of the evolution of civilizations --
mainly due to the sloppy or minimal treatment of nanotech and AI).

I've picked up Energies by Vaclav Smil, MIT Press, 1999, and have
been thumbing through it.  It strikes me as a book that most
Extropians should read.  Sources, uses and applications of energy
are areas that come up frequently for discussion in the list.
Fundamentally extropianism must be about the creation and application
of energy in controlled ways to combat entropy.

Energies is short (~200 pages), contains many interesting tables
and graphs and covers a wide range of topics:
1) Sun and Earth
2) Plants and Animals
3) People and Food
4) Preindustrial Societies
5) Fossil-Fueled Civilization
6) Transportation and Information

In short it serves as a book that provides you with a lot of
information in an easily accessed format that allows you to
think creatively about the topics.

Interestingly, it is dedicated to Philip and Phylis Morrison.

Just one example.
In Italy we can be dispossessed (for public utilities, in the public
interest) and the legal indemnity is exactly the 50 percent of the real

indemnity!) minus, of course, 20 percent for taxation (income).
So the net indemnity can be the 25 percent of the real value!

I can think of many reasons why this won't happen:

a) the leadership will simply pipe in fake video coverage, set up PRIOR
to  when the transparency became available to everyone, and they will
still have privacy.
b) all right and good thinking people will sure as hell not want 'that
twisted fuck' down the street to i) have a say in what is legal to do
and ii) be anywhere near their kids. If you think there is a problem now
with sexual offenders resettling into the community and people going
vigilante on them, think again what will happen with transparency.
People are only tolerant so long as you don't rub your 'perversions' in
their faces, so they don't have to think about it. Make it so it can't
be avoided, and give the busy bodies the means to put a 'Mrs. Grundy' in
every neighborhood, and we'll have a period of significant violence,
followed by the most repressive vanilla society, you think the Saudi and
Iranian religious police are bad? 
c) people will be very happy when the government stomps its foot down on
dissidents and deviants, right up until the government decides THEY are
dissidents and deviants.

On the contrary, since MY original point dealt with situations where
consent was not involved, then any precedent that did involve consent is
not relevant to the discussion, except to contrast the difference. I
would appreciate it if you were as honest about that point.

If the "self" and "values" are objective, then it's quite easy to see how
their destruction can be real and not merely just a matter of arbitrarily
labeling things as such.  One need not swallow all of Rand's philosophy or
even all of her ethics to see this is so.  Anything which destroys one,
where one does so willingly is self-sacrifice, right?

Also, Kant, e.g., in his _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_ tries to
separate moral actions from pleasure.  Granted, this might be hard to do in
practice, but his notion is that the good should be pursued regardless of
its consequences, especially regardless of pleasure and happiness.  That few
people practice this so sternly is perhaps because this view of morality is
so antithetical to living life it can hardly be consistently practiced.
(Why?  Well, if one consistently practices it, one will have little
emotional feedback, one will be miserable, and, ultimately, to sacrifice
one's self means to get rid of one's self, which means to be no more, which

There are, I understand, several Christian and other fringe/religious
channels in the USA ... and some planned for the UK. I have been approached
by some of the "pagan movement" about setting up a pagan/ new age channel
(cable, not internet).

I work with a post-production studio cum TV channel with direct cable feed
here in the UK, it really isn't such an expensive deal to set up such a
studio these days  ...... my own company, Bundex Film & TV already have film
production and editing facilities .......

It strikes me that the extropia/ trans-/ post-human community might also be
able to put together some programming ..... essential, I would argue, if we
are to breach the mainstream. E-lists and small academic conferences don't
really cut it!

There are plenty of human-era, primitive legacy-religions putting their
world view across to a large audience ... surely we should at least be on an
equal competitive footing ... after all, as radical futurists we should be
using technology to spread the word wherever possible?

Any thoughts? (I am busy for a couple of days but can mailed
steve@multisell.com).

Yeah, Natasha is the person to talk to about video content. Wow, with England,
California, and Seattle, we're gonna have the Extropian Television Network set
up pretty soon. Know what that means? We need more content.

Purely hypothetical, what would be a good extropian attitude to take if
it could be shown that the most serious danger in the short-term future
would be the rise of ubiquitious law enforcement? Personally I see this
as a more immediate threat than the oft-discussed nanowar scenario.

If a worker in Nazi-occupied Europe throws a monkey wrench into the
machinery, is he a Luddite?

And here's the revised version of my essay that I sent in.  Given as
there are multiple prizes, may we both win.

---

Summary:

     A greater understanding of the human brain is but one of the
advances likely to be available in 2050.  However, the abilities it will
grant, both on its own and in conjunction with other technological and
social trends, have the ability to reshape society much like computers
have.  This essay describes one way in which the technology may unfold,
from the viewpoint of someone who watched it happen.

UNIVERSITY APPLICATION ESSAY AX-G328904
SUBMITTED: FEB. 15, 2050

     "Specialist" is such a dirty word.  I prefer "focused", because
that is what I am guilty of: focusing on one subject.  I believe that,
with the help of modern technology, my studies of my chosen field may be
the last that any human will ever have to make, so that I may be an
unsurpassed master of my field for all time.

     Although this may seem unfashionable at the midpoint of the 21st
century, I assure you that specialization is a practice that was quite
popular up until recently.  Indeed, until nearly the end of the 20th
century, it was possible for people even in the most technologically
advanced nations to learn only a few basic facts about how the world
worked, stop learning by their early 20s, and live full and productive
lives.  Only the elite - scientists, engineers, chief politicians and
businessmen, and a few others - needed much more information to do their
jobs.

     Even then, some people advocated lifelong learning as a path to a
fuller life, but this movement never really caught on until recently.
When the general public was forced to choose between constantly
improving their minds and living in crushing poverty, most chose to keep
learning.

     One of the factors contributing to this development was the rate of
increase of knowledge available to humanity.  It is easy to assume that
the Information Revolution, fueled by an ever-increasing amount of
computational power starting in the latter half of the 20th century, was
the only cause.  However, this was not the case.  Another factor was the
rising human population, which meant that more people were creating or
discovering new ideas.  Computer networks merely allowed these ideas to
be communicated easily enough that most people became aware of the
amount of knowledge that was out there, where they had formerly assumed
that there were no answers to most of their questions, or that the
answers were practically impossible to find.

     Early attempts to learn significant fractions of this information
led to a phenomenon known as "information overload".  It was like a
perpetually starving band of nomads suddenly arriving at an
all-you-can-eat, infinitely stocked buffet.  Within that metaphor, it
should come as no surprise that most "overfed" and became proverbially
sick.  A few, either nearing this stage or seeing many of their comrades
fall to it, looked for ways to better handle this glut.  Various methods
of managing this information were tried, most essentially just
predigesting the "meal" at the expense of having direct access to some
details - or, to further the analogy, at the cost of some nutrients.
But these were all limited by the modes of communication to the end
destination: the human consciousness.

     Which led to the second factor: cybernetics.  This term used to
refer only to certain types of control systems, but around the early
1980s it acquired a pop culture definition of direct neural interface
between biological, especially human, nervous systems and any man-made
machine, especially computers and computer-controlled devices.  This
definition has now forced its way into mainstream academic use as well,
although more technically accurate names have been proposed.

     Experiments in cybernetics date back to ancient times, depending on
how loosely one defines the term, but the field only really got going in
the 1990s with the commercial introduction of chips designed to
stimulate a neuron depending on signals from some electronic device, or
vice versa.  These devices were originally intended to restore sensory
and control connections to people who had lost one or more limbs and
replaced them with prosthetics, to allow them to use these limbs as they
might otherwise have used their natural ones.

     The application of cybernetics to help people understand and make
use of information might seem obvious to us, but evidence of this
application is everywhere in our society.  At the time, the disastrous
results of various historical failures to improve humanity - for
instance, the eugenics movement that peaked in the early 20th century -
caused an embarrassed silence whenever further attempts at improving
humanity was mentioned.  Further, the aforementioned information
overload, combined with widespread negative sentiment towards those who
were handling information well enough to reap huge profits - financial,
emotional, spiritual, and otherwise - caused a series of popular
backlashes against many new technologies.  A backlash usually started
with a legitimate complaint about a particular product or service, but
took on a life of its own that refused to acknowledge when the original
issue was addressed, with participants continuing to complain as if the
complaints had never been answered.  Before long, these backlashes
became indiscriminate and uncompromising, running on instinctive fear of
anything unknown, enough to cause a backlash of their own.

     Perhaps the best example is that of the ecoterrorists who raided a
US government laboratory that was deliberately poisoning trees in order
to test possible cures for Anthrax-b.  The laboratory was in a race
against time to save the 10041st Armored Battalion, who had been exposed
to Anthrax-b in the process of preventing the Golden Jihad movement from
"purifying" India of their enemies.  The 10041st was visiting on the
night of the raid, preparing to go into quarantine if the Anthrax-b
could not be cured before it became contagious.  When the raiders
identified themselves, brandished guns, and asked everyone in the lab to
leave so as not to be hurt when they burned the lab down, the 10041st
killed them in a brief firefight.  A show trial absolved the 10041st of
murder charges on the grounds that they were protecting their only hope
for life, therefore to defend the laboratory was to defend their own
lives.  The ramifications of this legal precedent, and similar ones in
the EU, Japan, Russia, Australia, Chile, South Africa, and other
countries, are still being debated by legal scholars.

     However, the immediate political effect was to spark growing
resentment of the anti-technology movements.  One of the central theses
of these movements was a fear of these technologies being used to alter
human beings; thus, resentment of everything the movements stood for
gave political support to all kinds of research explicitly designed to
improve humanity.  This lead directly to the EU commissioning the third
enabling factor: the Human Neural Translation Project (HNTP).  In the
fashion of the earlier Human Genome Project, this was designed to create
a generic map of the human brain and which patterns of neural impulses
mapped to which thoughts.  This map would allow implanted devices to
send and read ideas, memories, and sensations to and from the human
mind.  As with the Human Genome Project, a decent amount of this
project's work had already been done.  It was known, for instance, that
only a generic map could be created, for each brain differed in some
details from every other brain.  Cybernetic device makers' widespread
use of "training scripts", which adapted each individual device to its
user over time, meant that only a generic map was needed for these
devices to use as a starting point.

     Even before the HNTP announced official completion, products were
already hitting the market that allowed people to download knowledge,
storing information that was not currently in use and prompting the mind
with ideas relevant to whatever was currently being contemplated.
Practically all versions of these products were made modular, so that
only the initial installation needed any surgery; upgrades could be
delivered either via signals transmitted by induced current or, once
someone figured out how to make plugs that could breach the skin without
risk of infection, direct cable link.  However, all of these versions
had the same module installed by default, which gave users the basics of
logic and how to learn new information.  It is widely suspected that the
vendors all copied the same module, but there are no records of who
might have written it, and no one has taken credit.  The information
modules we take for granted today, with packages of skills and knowledge
available on demand, all have the same basic architecture as this
default logic module.

     The ability to download knowledge was hailed at the time as the
start of a new golden era of science.  Critics highlighted numerous
problems with this idea, most notably the fact that utopia had not yet
arrived.  However, it should be pointed out that, as has been the case
every decade since at least the 1990s, we now live in an era of
unprecedented wealth and enlightenment, and all signs are that the next
decade will be even better in these respects.

     People are living longer, are healthier, and have more productive
lives; some figures indicate that the average expected life of a human
is growing about one year every year, leading many to ponder whether we
are now practically immortal or soon will be.  Advances in
nanomanufacturing now allow most population centers to generate their
own food, water, and power, regardless of any efforts to block shipment
by corrupt governments or hostile neighbors.  In fact, these advances
have directly caused the essential termination of those governments and
hostilities, as measured by their reduced tendency to provoke conflicts.

     Further contributing to our relative peace is the ability to
quickly download someone else's entire chain of reasoning, if that
someone else makes it available for download.  Most people find it far
easier to highlight points of disagreement by exchanging these chains
than to convey their arguments in words, since there is almost no
miscommunication when exchanging thought itself.  This has caused a
significant decrease in the type of misunderstandings that lead to
violence.

     Although money and certain rare physical resources still play a
part in our lives, most people work more for fame and credit than for
money.  The cost of living almost everywhere has dropped to where the
old minimum wage laws - which have not been updated since 2023, even to
account for inflation - now guarantee the necessities of life to anyone
willing to work just 10 hours a week.  Unprecedented levels of
investment, made possible by the money most people earn by working more
than 10 hours a week, ensure that there are enough jobs for everyone.

     It is true that we do not live in a utopia.  For instance, not
everyone has the ability to download thought.  Some people have
physically damaged brains, which the generic map does not fit, but there
are ways to rig the map to fit these individuals.  Some people choose
not to have the modules installed, and while a few of these have
developed alternate ways of coping - which, once understood, tend to be
incorporated into the devices and distributed as a module upgrade - most
of these find themselves unable to function in today's society.  These
people are, as a rule, unemployable, ignorant, and occasionally
dangerous.  For example, the ecoterrorists described above would act
much the same, with the same results, if they found themselves in
today's world.

     One of the current great philosophical debates is whether to force
the modules on these people.  While it is obvious to us what the
benefits to them - and the rest of society - would be, most of them have
not actively done any wrong that would warrant coercion.  We all benefit
when one of them, not having the same set of ideas most of us share,
comes up with an improvement on our processes.  The only module on which
there is no debate is the one that teaches how to learn and adapt to
new situations; while this skill can be picked up even without
downloading, those who do not, or refuse to, know it are universally
worse off.  Some countries are considering legislation to compel
installation of a module if these skills are not known by the local age
of adulthood, though public sentiment against these laws makes it
unlikely they will be passed at this time.

     Which leads me back to my original point.  With the ability to flow
more freely from field to field, most people choose to be jacks of all
trades, taking whatever career path they feel like, pursuing it for a
number of years, and switching when they grow bored.  This is certainly
a useful way of life, and ensures that we never run too low of any one
talent for long.  Whenever we do, someone always comes up with a module
for that talent if one does not yet exist.  However, I feel that I might
possibly be able to contribute more by devoting my life - or at least
possibly the next several centuries, if the immortalists are correct -
to but one pursuit.  I will, of course, contribute any modules for ideas
and skills I develop on the way, so that others may skip up to my level,
but I will not change from my course.

     You may find this amusing.  With all the changes that we have seen
recently, and the ever-increasing rate of changes, how will I know that
whatever occupation I choose will not soon become obsolete?  I
acknowledge this risk, and if it does, then I will switch, just like
anyone else.  But I want to take one field, one area of expertise, and
see if I can refine it until it can be logically proven that no higher
level of mastery is possible.  Throughout human history, there have been
those who were the best at their time, and possibly the best yet, past
or present.  I want to be the best in something for all time, or at
least the first who was the best: anyone else who needs to be good in
that area can then copy a module I will create to communicate my
experience.  Maybe, if I succeed, I can change to another field, or
maybe my success will open up some completely new field.  I honestly
doubt that, even given several times the universe's age, I will be able
to master all that can be mastered, nor would all of us combined if we
tried.  All signs are that there are an infinite number of skills out
there that we can learn.

     The field I choose first is...

There were two movies based on 1984, both called 1984. The first was, I
think, in ~1956 and starred Edmund O'Brien. The 2nd was made 'on

AFAIR the 2nd was much closer to the book, early on it seemed almost
paragraph-for-paragraph like the book. I think the 2nd was also Richard
Burton's last film.

I have a completely different take on implanted ID's: I hope we get them, 
and soon.

You see, I see this country (USA) as our property; it's our asset. We all 
derive our living from it. The benefits from our work here accrue to us (in 
large part).

And even the taxes benefit us, if unevenly.

I agree that my view is not the commonly held one, but is is the one that 
IMO defines the situation best. The benefits accrue to this who live and 
work here (although I agree that some do not work, when they could). But 
some come here to "steal" the benefits that accrue to us, the owners. They 
may well come here to work, and there is work here, and often it is good. 
That work is here because of the benefits of investing capital here versus 
somewhere else.

But that right --the right to our jobs, which are available here because of 
the qualities of this country (our property)--are available only to us, the 
owners. Therefore many "steal" our property by working here, when they did 
not "buy in".

You may say that this is a highly abstracted view, but I find it useful.

You may well argue that more people here enhances the value of our property 
because an large pool of labor attracts capital, and that there are 
synergistic effects as a result. Perhaps, but are there no limits to such an 
effect? Does a larger labor pool benefit some owners, and hurt others? I do 
find the idea that allowing highly educated people in would benefit most 
owners, but I see most immmigrants on the bus I ride every day. They do not 
bring much with them except there strong, young backs and reproductive 
systems.

Oh, yes, they DO bring their brains, but the quality of brains varies 
widely. Some brains are well-educated, others are not, and many of those 
riding the buses these says do not appear to want to be such (educated). 
They have allowed the upper classes in their own countries to rob them 
blind, and they will likely do so here as well.

Many of these immigrants send much of their money home, to be spent in some 
other country. Who benefits from these immigrants? The wealthy west side of 
Houston certainly does! Now they can get a maid for $10,000/yr instead of 
$16,000. Also, the tabs at the foo-foo westside eateries are not quite so 
high, thanks to the cheap dishwashers.


I can do without these benefits, myself. Convince me otherwise...

Until then, I say bring on the ID implants...

Alas, he got jammed somewhere else by the inevitable

arrived on the program pretty late, I'd blathered on, but wanted to hear
from horse's xenomouth. When he phoned in, he was brisk and generically
interesting but nothing unexpected, and I didn't get a chance to prod with
precise questions. So it goes. I'm not sure that this is such a cosmic

Good point.  Suppose a rock band, Aaron and the Analogs, decides not to release

a CD, but instead play exclusively live, and stipulate that no one may bring
any recording equipment in to the concert.  They check everyone entering for
recording equipment.  To the extent they can deter pirating, they are
monetarily rewarded for every note they play.  But they must build a following
club by club, with no broadcast airplay, if they want to discourage free
riders.

Another group, Diaz and the Digitals, record a CD at home, and send out their
hot single to every radio station they can think of.  Some listeners tape the
song and burn their own copies without paying them.  A small percentage of
listeners like the song enough to seek out the CD and buy it or tickets to
their live shows.  It's marketing.

How musicians market their music is their business.  The 'publicness' of a
good, which allows free-ridership, is not
an inherent characteristic but a function of the manner it is produced,
marketed, or even of the relevant unit in which the
information is imbedded.

Further, costs of exclusion are involved in the production of many goods. For
the owner of a movie theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls,
ticket windows, ushers. These serve to exclude or fence out 'freeriders'. Now
they could set up projectors and show the movies on screens in the open, and
then attempt to prevent casual passerbys from watching. The method of marketing

their product is their choice. In the case where their marketing decision
results in the publicness of a good, it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask

the government to force all who might potentially see the show without paying
to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or not. Or to force

passerbys to don glasses that prevent them from viewing the movie. Yet the
proponents of property rights in ideas choose such a method when they attempt
to get every person purchasing a blank tape to pay a royalty to a third party.
Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals sought to ban or
cripple entire technologies. This method, done in the name of preventing
technologies which are capable of recording publicized (broadcast) music
without loss of fidelity, would make mere ownership of tangible property (DAT
recorder) a crime. I view proposals for such an implementation of property
rights in ideas, which wipe out other areas of property rights altogether, as
inconsistent.

I don't support the ownership of ideas.  You can imbed your idea in tangible
physical objects and try to exercise control over that object with contracts,
etc.  If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want to "own"

ideas pay for the enforcement of that contract.  Market forces will probably
lead the computer programmer to tie a perceived value to the registration of
their program (cheap upgrades, technical support, etc.); rather than paying for

a protection agency that tries to police the digital information realm.  But
they would be welcome to try to enforce a contract against copying a program
that the purchaser would sign when he buys the product.  I just wouldn't
subscribe to a protection agency that used some of my
subscription fee to police copyright protection.

Read what you wrote:

it is the biological parents who are responsible for their biological
children."


It simply isn't true.  As you pointed out yourself.

Fair is not a concept that applies to these kinds of things. Careless has as 
it's roots the word: care. 

Life ain't fair. Women know this better than anyone. It's not fair your 
muscles are stronger than mine, is it? 
; )
In the real world, "fair" doesn't exist.  But cause and effect does. 

You could examine your motives (and concepts of self responsiblity) instead 
of looking outward for the fix to this situation.

If you were care-ful or care-ing, then your woman who you've impregnated will 
care too, and take your opinion into account. You'd have been care-giving in 
nature and wouldn't want to father a child that was unwanted and 
undersupported. We assume you'd BOTH have known that sperm can make women 
pregnant.

If you were careful in all your affairs, you would have chosen a sex partner 
who was intelligent and supportive as well, and would not make you or your 
child suffer. She's have agreed to discuss it with you and you would both 
agree on whether or not it was an accident that should be corrected, or 
something to celebrate and care for. Fairness has nothing to do with it. 
Taking care does.

If cause and effect is not something you care about, I agree with zero, get a 
vasectomy.

Sabotaging government law enforcement technology is good old libertarian
activism. Its not luddism. Ludd never went after British government facilities,
he and his people went after wool processing mills and mass manufacturers of
simple furniture.

I plan on busting police camera systems for as long as I can. Doesn't mean I
won't use camera systems for my own security system on my own property. If Spike

Twenty-one years ago I changed my name from Barbara Owsley to Bonnie Austin.
I've decided to go back to my original name of Barbara on my 51st birthday,
which is tomorrow, August 15. I'd thought about going back to the full name,
but I tried it out on a couple of people and got the same reactions I
remember from all those years before: "What?  How do you spell that?" and so
forth.  (the reason I chose Austin as a last name 21 years ago was because I
was moving to Austin, and I figured everyone would know how to spell it)

So I've decided to use Lamar, another of my family names.  My great
grandmother Annette Crenshaw Lamar was one of my most valuable role models,
although I didn't know it at the time.  She was old by the time I was up and
about, but I remember her as being curious and energetic and happy.  It was
Annette who taught me to read when I was a little girl (and also taught me
some French, which by now I've mostly forgotten--she and my grandmother
always wanted me to be able to read Victor Hugo's novels in the original
language, which is something I have yet to do).

Barbara Lamar

While I share some of your sentiments, I fail to see how an implant is going to
succeed when green cards fail. How is an implant going to make sure illegals
don't get jobs, when they get paid under the table most of the time (which means
that $10k they make is actually worth the $16 a legal worker makes, because all
that under the table cash is tax and SS free) with cash. Do you want to do away
with cash? Sorry, not something I'm interested in.

Frankly, in todays economy, having people willing to still do grunt work for
grunt work wages does not bother me at all. I can't find teenage kids anymore to
mow the lawn, they are either always at camp or working at internet jobs (or at
McDonalds for $9.00 an hour plus benies, no kidding). I don't want to be forced
to hire a professional landscaper who has a degree in horticulture and charges
$50 an hour. Thats like paying a heart surgeon to take a look at my sore throat.
If you don't want so many immigrants wherever you are, send some up here to New
Hampshire. There's plenty of work for them, unemployment is below 1% in my area.
Yeah, yeah, mow your own lawn, you say. Frig, I only do non-job work myself if
hiring someone else is more expensive than my own hourly rate.

I would hardly call that polite. Quite rude while faking politeness. Complete

Quoting what I said halfway through the discussion, and ignoring the stuff I
posted, like the fact that an anonymous donor is not considered a biological
parent in the legal sense, and if the husband of the recipient consents to the
process, even a known donor is not the legal 'biological parent' and has no
rights that would consistent with same.

Ultimately the biological parents ARE responsible, although that responsibility
is lifted from them by the state under certain conditions, which vary from state
to state. For those who question why is it that the state has any say in
reproductive matters (which court precedents recognise, that delving to
specifically in statute or precedent would violate the parent's right to privacy
under the Grizwold case). While I understand that with someone like you, Loree,
everything is relative and nothing is absolute, so this is probably very hard
for you to understand.

I think you need to add much more clarification to this concept.  What does
it mean that the USA is our property?  What parts of the USA?  The land?  Are
you saying that my land belongs collectivelly to the people of the US?  Or
do you just mean the businesses?  My company is owned by everyone else?

Then you suggest that if someone comes here and works, they're stealing
my property?  What exactly are they stealing?  Suppose some guy stands on
the other side of the border and makes a basket, and I buy it from him.
He is still stealing?  I don't see how it can become stealing simply if
he steps over the border before making his basket.

Even if you could come up with a principled reason to oppose immigration
(were your own immigrant ancestors stealing, BTW?), would it still follow
that implanted IDs are a good idea?  Wouldn't you have to consider the
costs and disadvantages of that technology before jumping in and saying
that it is good?

I think that no one, ever, should be required to accept any implant.

It should be a constitutional right to be free of bodily modification in any way.

Eat your favorite High-nutrient, Low-glycemic, Low-calorie, foods.
It cuts the rate of aging in half.
Avoid grains like corn and wheat.
Calorie restriction works because it removes these poisonous foods.
Yes, many things you call food are actually NOT FOOD!
Trust me.

	let's simplify this a bit. illegal immigrants are breaking the
law, and should be stopped. if we think they actually benefit us, we
should change the law so that they are no longer illegal. as to implants
as a enforcing measure ... i don't think the measure itself is
enforceable.

I think you'll find that even if the government tried to force it on people,
they'd have a clause exempting people who claim a  religious reason (much as you
can get out of social security payments if your religion forbids it officially,
like the Amish.)

The more you know... the less the world knows.
As you become smart you see the world become stupid.
I don't trust the public to do anything...
but die like they believe they will.
I can't wait to get off this rock before some idiot kills us all.
That way they keep their freedom,
but I'm not dying in the process of granting it.
People have helped me so little in my life
I'm curious as to why I'm even writing this.
oh yea, now I remember.

Without extropians the world's only chance of survival is luck. :-)

Perhaps you are familiar with a certain business model:
A group of people buy a piece of property. They own it *jointly*.
They make improvements. They build facilities. It's a good location. They 
prosper!

Each one is allocated a certain area, and there is also a common area. Each 
sets up shop in his area, and they each obtain a living thusly. If there is 
sufficient leftover common area, they may allow outsiders to become 
partners. Newcomers must "buy in", or perhaps they offer other inducments to 
partnership; perhaps they will bring in additional business. The partners 
may vote on allowing newcomers. Some partners may argue for, or against, 
etc.

In any event, the current partners *decide* whether any newcomers are 
allowed in.
It is a (not necessarily equal) partnership.

Back to the aforementioned business model:
Suppose some Joe sneaks onto the property, and he sets up shop. He does 
business. He makes money. Maybe he gives it to his wife, who knows.
But he hasn't obtained permission; he is deriving benefits from the 
partnership, but he hasn't obtained *permission*. He is, in the commonly 
accepted parlance, a *thief*.

>Even if you could come up with a principled reason to oppose immigration
>(were your own immigrant ancestors stealing, BTW?),

Different legal system. Why stop there? Go all the way back to monkeymen...
I prefer to work towards a better future.

Certainly it should be evaluated. Let's do so.

In the real world, as opposed to Poli Sci class, it is almost always true
when a bad law is repealed that the biggest factors are people breaking the
law and law enforcement officials refusing to enforce it fully.  Rosa
Parks, thankfully, didn't say, "Well, I'll sit at the back of the bus for
now, until through established procedures I get a proposition on the next
ballot, and convince enough people to vote my way."  Alcohol prohibition in
the U.S. didn't end because enough Creme Soda drinkers were convinced to
legalize beverages they hadn't tasted in 14 years.

Thanks, I hadn't had a chance to read it earlier.

I liked Nick's essay.  It was particularly refreshing that he avoided
most of the references to the 1990s and the year 2000, trying to really
present a dialog that might have occured in 2050.  Naturally there was
some discussion of expectations of 50 years earlier since they were
talking about progress over 50 years.  But Nick also had them looking
back at events in the 2010s and 2020s, which is entirely realistic.

I'm not a big fan of transparency, so I wasn't thrilled with Nick's
reliance on that social convention as the explanation of why the world
hadn't destroyed itself.  Transparency raises many difficult issues, as
we have discussed here before.  While Nick's essay was not the place to
defend it, I was uncomfortable seeing his panelists give an endorsement
to a technology which I feel brings serious problems.

It was amusing to see the panelists consider the possibility that the
universe has multiple branches and that humanity has wiped itself out in
most of them.  It seems to me that since their personal experiences of
the world have apparently not been harmed by the hypothetical deletion
of their cousins in other branches, they might well adopt the view that
there is no reason for caution with regard to new technologies.  As long
as some branch survives with them in it then they will be as satisfied
with life as they are at present, since they have already experienced
a similar pruning.

Hi Steve.

I work in DV and interactive storytelling.  As you've pointed out, the
ability to reach a large audience with televised content is getting easier
and easier to do.  I'm sure you've heard of technologies like the Trinity
box-- essentially a live broadcast studio in a box.

I think it's clear that 'niche' programming is on the rise-- and I think
you're absolutely right that this community should be thinking about ways in
which to establish a presence in that market.

Since I work as a creative consultant for companies who wish to have an
interactive presence online, my bias is to look for new dynamic ways to
'broadcast.'  This doesn't mean that I think that the time has come quite
yet to abandon the TV, however I think its smart to look for ways to
leverage the two media together (broadcast TV and net interactivity.)

One thing I've found is that most people fit into the classic scene from
Stranger in a Strange Land, where Mike the Martian doesn't understand people at
all until he is at the zoo one day, and sees a monkey with some food. A bigger
monkey comes along and takes his food away, so he goes and takes food away from
a smaller monkey, who does the same to a smaller monkey. A large percent of the
population is locked into this little fascist/serf mindset. They think that they
are normal, but 'that other guy' is sick, twisted, criminal, 'not our kind,
dear' who needs to have his rights stripped from him and locked up for the good
of himself and themselves. People have forgotten the classical liberal ethic,
because liberalism has been twisted by the last century of class warfare and
racial strife. When you wear people down from too much conflict, strife, and
change, they will vote for those that promise them relief. How can you change
this? There needs to be a memetic campaign to program people to embrace change.
Not an easy thing to do. It needs to be low key, involving writers of fiction
and non-fiction, as well as news columnists, pundits, and personalities.

One idea I've had is a twist on the old 'the more things change, the more they
stay the same'. This saying seems to be typically a cynics view of change, that
the basic flaws of the human animal is still doing the same dumb destructive
things today that he did as a savage. Turing this around, take advantage of the
romantic view most people have toward 'the olden days' of apple pie, baseball,
soda fountains, and other Norman Rockwell scenery. Trying to show in our
literature how the changes coming up in the future can allow people to recapture
that sense of small town community again. For example, telecommuting allows
people to live and work as independent business people in whatever small town
they wish to live in, doing work for some big company hundreds or thousands of
miles away in a nearly invisible way. Mom and dad can actually stay home to
raise their kids rather than both working 50-60 hour workweeks elsewhere and
leaving their kids home alone with nothing but the tv and video games.

In the current issue of Science there is an article by Ban et al that reports the 3D atomic
scale structure of the most complex object ever, the largest of the two subunits of a
ribosome. This thing is huge, 2.6  million daltons,  more than 50 times as big as your
average protein. It has 3,000 nucleotides of RNA bent into a complex shape folded in
out and around 31 different interlocking proteins. I find this really interesting at a lot of
different levels. It's amazing they can find the 3D shape of something this big and complex.
The object itself is very important, ribosomes are where proteins are made. There are
practical implications, the ribosomes in bacteria are major target for antibiotics.
There are philosophical implications too.

Two-thirds of the mass of ribosome's comes from RNA, and it turns out that the RNA
is the catalyst for the protein synthesis, not the one third that is protein as you might
expect, the protein acts just as girders to hold the machine together. RNA can not only
store information like DNA it can also catalyze chemical reactions like proteins. RNA
acting as a enzyme had been noticed before but never at something this important or
fundamental to all life. It give support to the theory that when life first originated 4 billion
years ago it contained no DNA and no protein, just pure RNA.

The kid's name was Chris McCandless, as I recall. I found his story quite
moving--he made some mistakes that appear stupid in retrospect, but I could
picture myself making similar mistakes if I'd been in his situation. (I
wouldn't have made mistakes about the plants, but then I've been studying
wild & cultivated plants since I was 10 years old).

I believe the root of the plant in question WAS edible, but the seeds were
not. Chris had been eating the root of the plant all along; his metabolic
problems started when the seeds ripened and he began to eat them. There are
a number of common garden plants for which roots are edible but seeds and
leaves are not--Irish potatoes and jicamas, for example.

I'd like to make a toast to Greg Burch -- 

A person who has made profound contributions toward enhancing
the legal, historical and aesthetic minds of extropians.  I admire
you because you are an artistic gardener, an explorer of environments,
a knowledgeable history buff, a masterful lawyer, a loyal friend,
a person of enormous feelings and compassion, and last, but not
least, a tall drink of water.

Long life to you!

Natasha

P.S. "Toasts and the custom of toasting have been around for
thousands of years. Some even claim that toasting is only a day
or two younger than drinking itself. In fact, one toasting historian
(yes, there really are toasting historians) says a primitive
form of toasting dates back thousands of years to nomadic tribes
who splattered a few drops of drink on sacrificial altars to
appease the hunting gods. 

The word “toast,” as applied to drink, has its roots in the 1600s
when it was common to toss in a piece of bread or crouton into
one’s beverage as flavoring... mmmm. According to historian Paul
Dickson, the first application of the word occurred in Bath,
England in 1709. As the story goes, a “noted beauty” of that
fair city was seen bathing in public, when an admirer—so taken
by her loveliness—filled a cup with the bathwater and drank it
in her honor! Soon after, another admirer (admittedly half-cocked)
declared his admiration for the lady, but his revulsion for the
bath water. So, instead, he offered to eat the toast in her honor.
And thus, the term stuck. 

For the Politically Correct:
It should be noted that almost as long as people have been toasting
one another, there have been those who believed the custom was
nothing more than an excuse for debauchery. In fact, Charles
the Great, Maximilian, Charles V, and even Louis XIV all enacted
harsh penalties against the practice of toasting. The custom
was even made illegal in colonial Massachusetts. (It was repealed
eleven years later due to the law being largely ignored.) 

So frown upon it if you will... but the time-honored practice
of toasting appears to be here to stay."

Thanks. One has to compromize in places and have the panellists explicitly
describe things that by 2050 one could probably refer to directly using some
new jargon. In the final version (just uploaded) I changed the dialogue a
bit so that Emily comes across more consistently as the conservative.

It's more than a mere convention: it's an actual global surveillance network

Tell me technology-solution to the goo-problem that is without potential
serious complications! I used this postulate because I thought it gave the
most convenient scenario of the world in 2050 which was both reasonably
realistic and would allow me to discuss a wide range of transhumanist ideas
(nanotech, goo, superintelligence, VR, cryonics, life-extension, Idea
futures etc).

that the

itself out in

Actually, Neil (the philosopher on the panel) is referring to possible
extraterrestrial civilizations in our own (classical) universe.


It seems to me that since their personal experiences of

the view that

technologies.  As long

satisfied
		with life as they are at present, since they have already
experienced

Even in the many-worlds picture (which was not referred to in the essay),
this ("quantum suicide" idea) would not be correct. My view is that desire
for survival would simply have to be reinterpreted as desire to survive on
many branches with a high measure. All activities would then proceed as
usual. And I am confident that virtually everybody would act in accordance
with this reinterpretation.

Crikey,  so now they've had some success with ripping up GM and found it
easy, they're going to attempt "bigger" targets?  Such as the telephone
system, or maybe just the 911 part?

These ppl sound more scary by the minute.

Am I missing something on the fingers issue?  Anyone care to explain?

Actually, getting pregnant for hooking a man/extra welfare cash thing
happens a bit here.  These days the hooking a man bit doesn't apply so
much, as it tended not to work!  Most don't bother for the small amount of
welfare anymore, plus jobs are plentiful....

In http://www.herald.com/content/archive/living/barry/1999/docs/aug13.htm
Dave Berry offers his version of the Street Performer Protocol.  After
providing three rather abbreviated chapters of a new Harry Potter book,
he writes:

 That's all I've written so far. If you young readers would like me
 to finish this book, all I need is for two million of you to send me
 one dollar apiece.  Or, if that sounds too greedy, I'd settle for just
 two of you sending me one million dollars apiece. The important thing
 is that we all work together to find a way for Uncle Dave to ''share
 the magic'' with you young readers.  Because Uncle Dave loves you very
 much. He would hate to have to turn you into squid.

Well, it worked for Stephen King...

All,

A fellow Transhumanist and myself are investigating the possibility of
establishing an Irish Transhumanist Group.

We're not sure what level of awareness there is in Ireland (we think it's
low) but such a group is probably overdue a start at least.

We'd love to hear from any Irish members of this or any
Transhuman/Extropian list who would be interested in partaking.  If you are
interested email me at the address in the sig below.

Thanks,



James....

Push the button that lets you view by subject, and then use the "find on page"

"free will," "mind," "ineffabel" etc.

Well, I must say that it is nostalgic to be back on the "Grasshopper" side; it
makes me feel young and naive again.  Though I endeavor to maintain what, in the
martial arts, is called "Beginner's Mind," it is quite difficult to find the
patience to, once again, wade through mountains of non-falsifiable
speculations.  You assert that you are a thinker, and that you are thinking
thoughts, but you cannot provide me with any proof.  I find it just as
reasonable that your thoughts (memes) are thinking you, and in the process are
providing a strong illusion that there is a 'you' in there.  These memes are
part and parcel of all the self propagating patterns that make up the Universe,
all one thing, all one level.

Mirabeau's brother John was my grandmother's great grandfather (or something
like that.  It's hard to keep these kinship things straight).  Since
Mirabeau didn't have any sons to carry on the family name, my great
grandfather Arthur Lamar was the oldest living representative of the family
in Austin when Lamar Boulevard was built.  My father was a little boy at the
time and remembers helping Arthur cut the ribbon to officially open the
street. Annette, she who taught me to read, was Arthur's wife.

There's another Barbara Owsley in Houston, BTW, married to Alvin Owsley Jr.
who used to practice law in Houston--I believe he's retired now.  When I was
a kid, people who didn't know me well often assumed I was one of Barbara &
Alvin's kids since I had the same name.

Barbara

On the concept of changing one's name, I have always supported the idea
whole heartedly.  When one is born into the world, it is impossible to have
the choice of one's name...that responsibility is left to the discretion of
the parents.  However, when you get to a certain age, there is no reason
not to choose a name that you feel suits you somewhat better.

A good method of doing this is developing local groups and eventually
securing slots for public access television broadcasting.  As Mike Lorrey
alluded to, my NWExtropians group is working on this right now, as well as
a few other areas.  The first requirement is to acknowledge the group's
objective, and decide from there the kind of programming you feel apt.
This is a relatively easy way to propagate some positive transhuman memes.

I was 18 years old on the day that I arrived as a
freshman checking in at my dormitory at Ball State
University. I desperately needed change in my life.
I'd hated high school with a passion and looked
forward with great anticipation to finding kindred
minds in the university setting. 

A stranger walked up to me, instroduced himself, and
asked me my name. Without hesitation, I responded,
"Scott" ... a complete fabrication ... a name picked
out of the blue. I didn't think about it, I just
responded. All I knew was that I was no longer the
person previously referred to as "Bill".  My new
persona deserved a new name. Few of my old friends
understood this change at first, but they got used to
it eventually.

Perhaps a person's middle name should be left blank at
birth, to be filled in by the person at age 18.

I am still ...

Scott

Dear Greg,

I absolutely agree with Natasha. 

It was a pleasure to meet you in Spring at the Foresight Gathering. Have
a wonderful happy birthday!

Dont worry Mike, my ideal is entirely *voluntary* surveillance {except, I suppose,
for criminals, who would be watched against their will.}  Your comment regarding
increased vigilantism, etc, caused me to wonder how many deviants there are
in society.  I would suspect not that many, and we could reserve a big state like
Nevada that stays free of surveillance.

Regarding the prudish causing headaches, The prudish would find themselves
marginalized in a transparent society.  Who would want them in charge of
anything?  Furthermore, my notion of surveillance and transparency
has nothing to do with what is done in ones home.  I acknowledge the possibility
of bug-borne cameras, but even I am against those.  I would consider
it a worthwhile pursuit figure ways to defeat such devices.

U-surv in public places only, kinda like what they are doing in London.  People
are not free if they must fear thugs.  And no, we are not free if we need to
carry sidearms whenever we go where there are masses of proletariat.  England's
cameras and face recognition software is a good way to clean up a bad
area of town.  I doubt it would lead to a police state.  spike

It's not slang, just a.... surreal way of saying the symbol is not the
object- so your changing your name doesn't change you directly.  Happy
Bday and enjoy your new/old name.

Mike Lorrey will be so delighted with this!  He always thought you were up to something anyway and now he can try to figure it out! :)

And attach a webcam on your head for us the next time you enter an s & m club...  Zero, I really didn't think a family man like you would go into such torrid places. ;)

Well said!  After meeting at Extro4 Greg Burch, Greg Bear and

James, let me guess.  You are young.  Less than about... 40?  You see,
my young friend, you have a most unpleasant experience still ahead of
you, for when you visit your doctor after ~40, you must have your prostate
examined.  I found this to be a *most* distasteful experience.  Any man
over 40 who visits the doctor *for any reason*, including to deliver a
package, gets a finger up the kazoo.  {8-[

On the up side {of sorts} this experience developed in me a sense of
sympathy for homosexuals, for after having had a prostate exam, I realize
that their form of lovemaking must be excruciating.  For that reason, they
must have an overwhelming desire to please their mates, at their own
expense, which is a desireable personality characteristic.  Gays, is this
notion approximately correct?  spike

Perhaps, but like credit cards, I can see a system evolving where only those with
implants will be given many privileges.  If you operate strictly with cash, it's nearly
impossible now to rent a car, stay in a hotel, or have regular cell phone service.
Also, I can see various insurance companies giving discounts to those people willing to
be tracked in their automobiles.  In other words, privacy will be a pricey commodity.

I wonder, haven’t you noticed that, when it comes to information, the 
endless historical progression has been toward dissemination?  I do believe 
that we humans are capable of just about anything we set our minds to, with 
the exception of large scale consensus.  And that is precisely what it would 
seem to take in order to cram the information genie back into his lamp.

I agree we should answer the question of what is desirable before we get to 
what is possible.  But personally I’m satisfied that freedom of information 
promotes the greater good far more than concealment does.  Your mileage of 
course may vary, but so far no one has served up a good enough argument to 
dissuade me of my conviction.

OK, you’re obviously a smart guy.  Let’s hear *your* idea for a workable 
“social contract” that’s going to keep people from pirating music and 
software.  Sure you can shut down Napster.  But can you shut down IRC? or 
Gnutella? or Freenet?  I’ll tell you what, in the unlikely event that you 
*can* come up with a workable solution, I know some folks over at the RIAA 
who would be happy to make you very rich in exchange for your bright ideas.

Perhaps, but only for the first 2 seconds.  He will be disappointed to find

That may only get you so far.  There was a guy out here in California 
recently who tried to get a drivers license without showing the DMV his SSN, 
(he claimed it was the "mark of the beast" foretold of in the book of 
Revelations).  The DMV wasn't convinced, and refused to issue him a license. 
  Naturally he sued (I did say he was from California didn't I?).

The appellate court said "no dice."  Driving is a privilege.  You can refuse 
the mark of the beast if that's what is required to save your soul from 
Hell, but your price will be having to endure California's public 
transportation system (a fate far worse than Hell could ever be).

I got email about a new book, "Robo Sapiens: Evolution of a New Species,"
by Faith D'Aluisio and Peter Menzel.  According to the promotional
material:

    Around the world, scientists and engineers are participating in a
    high-stakes race to build the first intelligent robot. Many robots
    already exist -- automobile factories are full of them. But the new
    generation of robots will be something else: smart machines that
    act like living creatures. When they are brought into existence,
    science fiction will have become fact. What will happen then? With
    our prosthetic limbs, titanium hips, and artificial eyes, we are
    already beginning to resemble our machines. Equally important, our
    machines are beginning to resemble us. Robots already walk, talk,
    and dance; they can react to our facial expressions and obey verbal
    commands. When they take the next step and become fully autonomous,
    what will they do? Will we be partners or rivals? Could we meld
    into a single species -- Robo sapiens?

    In Robo sapiens, Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio present the next
    generation of intelligent robots and their makers. Accompanying
    brilliant photographs of more than one hundred robots is an account
    of the little-known, yet vitally important scientific competition
    to build an autonomous robot.  Containing extensive interviews with
    robotics pioneers, anecdotal "field notes" with behind-the-scenes
    information, and easy-to-understand technical data about the
    machines, Robo sapiens is a field guide to our mechanical future.

Might be interesting for someone to read and report on it.

Well, then, how about this:  it must always be so that the government never use
implants for identification or any other general purpose.  This is along the lines of
not necessarily being assigned a Social Security Number (Taxpayer Identification
Number), but completely different in that it involves an actual implant.

Now about that, basically, the government has been charged to protect the concept of
Social Security, and partially that means the SSN should not be used as a globally
unique identifier, and that the government should not maintain indices to otherwise
unrelated data based upon citizens' identity, non-governmental lives, or their
demographic profile.

The Spring 2000 issue of _International Security_ [24(4)] has two essays on
last year's Kosovo War that might be of interest to Extropians and
transhumanists: "Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate" by Daniel A. Byman
and Matthew C. Waxman and "The War for Kosovo: Serbia's Political-Military
Strategy" by Barry R. Posen.

Both present excellent analyses of the war and its outcome (to date, that
is).  Also, in Posen's article, he cites the "Rambouillet Agreement: Interim
Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo" at
http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html

During an exchange on this list with Michael Lorrey, I also cited it, but,
sadly, the above URL was not active at the time.  (I'd read the agreement
on-line, but could not find any government web pages with the agreement,
save for those of the Serbian government.  The above source is the US State
Department.)  Now it's back up.  Please read, especially, "Appendix B:
Status of Multi-National Military Implementation Force."  This was the
agreement before the war began and some believe that this particular section
was put into the agreement -- along with several others -- to make sure
Serbia (FRY, or whatever you want to call it) would not sign the agreement,
thereby giving NATO, especially the US, a chance to bomb.

Of course, other parts of the agreement might have also pushed Serbia's back
to the wall.  It's also interesting to note in what key ways the current
situation differs from that of the original agreement, if one is to judge
the success for any side of the war.

Anyway, read it and draw your own conclusions.

Cheers!

Its very simple, as we've said before: Those who lead plain jane normal
average vanilla lives will attract no interested observers, while those
that are odd: very beautiful, ugly, perverted, strange, rich, etc will
attract all the attention and will suffer persecution from the
intolerant vanilla majority. To avoid this, you'll have people being
what they are not to avoid surveillance by others, adding stress and
decreasing happiness and health, increasing suicides and other stress
related 'rat experiment' phenomena.

I don't have my ssn on my drivers license. The proper argument is that
it is illegal for other government agencies to use the ssn, that it is a
private number between the holder and the SSA, and forcing disclosure is
a federal felony violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, punishable by a
$20,000 fine and ten years in jail. Now, why did you want my SSN???? ;)

Thats what you get for not using the right code words. However, if you
are Amish, or belong to another religion that objects to social
security, and you legally don't have an SSN, they DO have to give you a
drivers license, or you can sue them for religious persecution. The guy
in the case you mention was probably some lone wacko who did not have
the weight of a real religion to back him.

The thing is is that the conditions set forth in Appendix B are not very
different from the agreements that all NATO member nations have to sign
to host NATO troops. The differences being there specifically because
Serbia was, in fact, an agressor nation in opposition to NATO. Being
given the opportunity to cooperate prior to the bombing is markedly
different from the options Serbia gave the other republics when they
declared indiependence. Serbia just started bombing and shooting
non-serbians by the thousands. You really don't have much to stand on
here trying to make Milosevic look like the victim.

On August 15th, IBM announced its development of the world's currently most
advanced quantum computer. From the article:

"[Isaac] Chuang said in an interview that his team used the test quantum
computer to solve a typical mathematical problem used in cryptography --
finding the period of a function. The computer was able to solve any
example of the problem in one step, while a conventional computer would
require repeated cycles to solve the problem."

The sad truth is that he was just another cheechako who though he

because he "knew" better.

Another sad tale along with Jack London's "To Light A Fire" which
I reread annually to remind myself that Mother Nature will let her

Some people may think I'm a bit silly for always having a survival

Oh yes, that's simple. A technological problem usually has a technological
solution that can be prompted by law.

- Make it illegal to make programs that can copy other peoples copyrighted
material without their consent.

- Make it illegal to make anonymous filesharing, so you can always trace who
is sharing a file.

- Automate pirate hunting, by making bots that scours the net for illegal
content and write out high enough tickets to the responsible parties.

- Make the isp's responsible for illegal content or make them monitor their
network for illegal content. Just search for filename, filesizes and file
content.

- Make the software author acountable for how his software is used. Go for
the authors of gnutelle and freenet etc. Soon they will not write the
software anymore.

- etc. etc. etc.

That we don't want the above things to happen does not mean that they cannot
happen. That is very naive. If something puts pressure on the society, the
society will usually put sufficient pressure the other way until the problem
is solved. From societys POW. We can obviously see why the above solutions
would be bad stuff

It would be easy for a country to pass a law making programs that can copy other
peoples copyrighted material without their consent illegal, but I don't see why that would
have any effect on programs that can copy other peoples copyrighted material without
their consent.

In other words shut down the Internet, if the phone company was

In other words make the writing of any software illegal. Doesn't sound
very practical to me.

 Not exactly. Another alternative is that the theory can deny that the
state of a system is independent of the future measurements.
 Huw Price offers a simple explanation in his interesting book Time's Arrow
of a local theory where measurements yield single, definite results. He
rejects the assumption that cause must precede effect, and claims that
the measurement causes the correlations.

Sure :-)
The idea that it is both possible and preferable to find a common
preference, using a consent-based approach comes from Sarah Lawrence who
recently spoke at the World Libertarian Conference, ISIL 2000, in London,
Ontario, Canada, on the subject of Taking Children Seriously: The Final
Phase of the Enlightenment.


"A common preference is a solution to a problem, or resolution of a
disagreement, that all parties prefer to their prima facie positions, and to
all other candidate solutions they can think of. It is the solution that
pleases everyone involved in the disagreement.

Some people claim that finding common preferences is not possible in the
real world. What makes it possible is the joint creativity of the parties
involved applied to the specific problem. The only approach that works is to
seek a better solution that both parties agree is better than their initial
ideas. If either party is only willing to hold on to their original theory,
the theory is *entrenched* and the problem-solving process cannot be
rational."

A basic principle held by people who try to find a common preference
rather than defaulting to a *might makes right* stance, is that autonomy is
extremely important and worthy of respect.

Existing forms of relationships, such as employer-employee, husband-wife,
parent-child, involve promises not to develop in certain ways. Moreover,
they involve a promise to interact with each other according to a certain
fixed pattern which has certain fixed roles in it, and not to deviate from
those roles.

*Autonomy* refers to the psychological state of being free of intractable
internal conflicts, of acting from one's own intrinsic motivations rather
than extrinsic ones. An autonomous person is a free-thinker, one who is not
hobbled by fixed roles and other coercion-inducing obligations and
expectations.

In an *autonomy-respecting-relationship* people don't promise or expect to
fulfil a predetermined role for the duration of the relationship, but
instead expect to be able to get along with each other in such a way that
each party is trying to make the other have the best possible life.

.........So, there you go!

J.Smith

Subject: [Robot-for-President] New book, Robo Sapiens 

When I used the expression "robo sapiens" in "Machine Psychology" I
wasn't aware that anyone else had used it previously. Anyway, same old
issue re the time in history (also part of the Singularity) when we can no
longer differentiate homo sapiens from robo sapiens by all important
criteria of life, intelligence and learning ability. I'll stick with 2012
AD and "the end of history" on the Mayan Calendar re a likely date. By
that time, P3 might be P12, socially interacting on a daily basis with
humans here in BC ("Happy Honda Land") and a lot of folks wondering if the
most highly programmed of the P12's might make the best Premier.

Subject: New book, Robo Sapiens

I got email about a new book, "Robo Sapiens: Evolution of a New Species,"
by Faith D'Aluisio and Peter Menzel.  According to the promotional
material:

    Around the world, scientists and engineers are participating in a
    high-stakes race to build the first intelligent robot. Many robots
    already exist -- automobile factories are full of them. But the new
    generation of robots will be something else: smart machines that
    act like living creatures. When they are brought into existence,
    science fiction will have become fact. What will happen then? With
    our prosthetic limbs, titanium hips, and artificial eyes, we are
    already beginning to resemble our machines. Equally important, our
    machines are beginning to resemble us. Robots already walk, talk,
    and dance; they can react to our facial expressions and obey verbal
    commands. When they take the next step and become fully autonomous,
    what will they do? Will we be partners or rivals? Could we meld
    into a single species -- Robo sapiens?

    In Robo sapiens, Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio present the next
    generation of intelligent robots and their makers. Accompanying
    brilliant photographs of more than one hundred robots is an account
    of the little-known, yet vitally important scientific competition
    to build an autonomous robot.  Containing extensive interviews with
    robotics pioneers, anecdotal "field notes" with behind-the-scenes
    information, and easy-to-understand technical data about the
    machines, Robo sapiens is a field guide to our mechanical future.

Might be interesting for someone to read and report on it.

I could as easily say: when it comes to technology, the endless historical
progression has been towards destruction.

The forces of empowerment rise.  And we as a people, must rise with them.

This concept is very close to my core beliefs on this issue.  Our attempts
to control the 'untameable' is what's going to keep us in this game.

I think you're right.  We need a way to get ahead of the curve.  Everything
is about to spiral (is spiralling) out of our control.  Personally, I'd like
to rewrite the rules.

A lot of intelligent futurists have written of scenarios in which humanity
is destroyed, plowed over or consumed by some inevitable self-replicating
technology of the future.  I think this fate is enormously likely.  But if
we were really -really- clever, we'd try to write ourselves as a virus into
the fabric of reality and bootstrap ourselves into the next sentience
echelon.

That's why I want us to have serious control over our information-- I want
it to be attached to us.  Yes, information would breed faster and be bigger
without our interference-- wild horses ARE faster without riders.

When certain people hear the term 'IP' they think, "human meddling,"
"government inertia," "artificial restrictions," and I'm sure they just want
to say to me: "Hey, let go of the steering wheel-- it'll be much bigger
without you!"

And I'm like, "Yeah, but that's my car!"

And we'll just sit in the gutter and watch it roar off by itself into the
sunset.

Personally, I'm not inclined to just sit back and hope it becomes real
generous and loops around to pick me up.

Well, this probably boils down to a core philosophical (or more likely,
political) divide.  I'm not certain that there is a good enough argument to
dissuade you of your conviction (or myself, either.)  I simply think that
our goals are different.  I -want- a system over which we constantly
struggle for control.  I -want- privacy.  I don't care a whit about free
music, I want smart information.  I want complicated transactions,
multi-faceted selection pressures, intricate markets, competition,
individual creative empowerment, direct positive feedback loops, cheap beer,
spidey sense, and a date with Elizabeth Shue.

I suspect you think I'm misguided for wanting to ride the bull, but baby, I
wanna ride the bull!




P.S.: If anyone tells you that I ever lived in the city of Calgary, Alberta,
they're damn stinking liars.




P.P.S.: And especially that part about Elizabeth Shue.

It's rather disheartening to think we battled the dogmatic right in the
60's for freedom of speech so that a bunch of young left wing snots with
their air-head profs could abuse this liberty now.

On a more positive note, I think Gelerneter has said a lot here. IMO the
problem we have with actualizing a high tech society using the
state-of-the-art technology is that of finding recognized political
leadership. "Political" could include well-know high tech personalities
like Moravec, Kurzweil, Gelernter etc. I'm not being elitist about this,
just realistic, in terms of basic social-psych principles. So let's look
at the "Oxygen Alliance Project" with its $50,000,000 grant at MIT. How
can we get more out of it than a lot of interesting "gadgets" like
computers you can wear on your glass frames or sew into your jacket?
How about inducing them to design a REALLY intelligent house instead of
the mickey mouse "smart homes" that are passed off on us today?

[Non-member submission]

Hello all,
James Corbally and myself Colm O Dushlaine have
decided to attempt to establish some sort of
transhumanist forum here in Ireland.It is intended to
deal with transhuman-related themes and futuristic
thought in general.
We hope that this will provide a very important arena
for the discussion of future technologies and their
impact or at least potential impact on us.It is about
time something like this arrived in Ireland.We're not
thinking enough,these days,about a future that
-through technology - is arriving faster and faster at
our doorstep.
Anyway,we would appreciate it if any member of this
list knows anyone Irish(or not) and interested (or are
themselves Irish(or not) and interested) in being part
of this
community.
It will take some time to establish what we hope to
call ITA, but we would greatly appreciate any
suggestions,comments and participation.

Kind regards,
Colm O Dushlaine

The GATT provides mechanisms under the WIPO to establish this internationally.
Countries that refuse to accept WIPO rulings get electronically embargoed.

It all rests on enforcement, of course. Shutting off the internet to countries
that do not enact such laws and enforce them is easy to do.

That doesn't shut down the internet, it merely removes players who refuse to
play by the rules, and who refuse to only deal with people who play by the
rules.

No, bill the software author for all royalties unpaid as a result of people

Good news! Progressive Insurance, based in Ohio, will now offer 25% to 50%
discount on car insurance if you fit their patented Autograph device in your
car.

See http://www1.progressive.com/media_relations/2nd_patent.htm

This device contains a GPS receiver and a mobile phone. It monitors, and
records, when, where, and how fast you drive and sends the info back to
Progressive.

Progressive will analyze your driving habits and alter your monthly bill
based on your actual, rather than your statistically possible, risk. They
estimate that this may save you between 25% and 50% off your premium.

So, for example, if you have a second car which is driven less, don't drive
in rush hour, you stay at the speed limit, and you don't park in high risk
areas, you'll pay less. (And you'll probably live longer by being a better
behaved driver).

Before you immediately panic about this surveillance of your behavior,
remember that your mobile phone is already (or very soon will be) providing
the authorities with very similar information.

Now, can this info be requested (subpoenaed) by people who may have an
interest in your movements?

Who cares?  Zero and Spike - grab your discounts now!

FRY/Serbia is not a NATO member.  NATO is a defensive alliance.  Originally,
it was only intended to last about a decade, and then was mainly as a
counter to potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  Yugoslavia was
never a member of this alliance.

> The differences being there specifically because
> Serbia was, in fact, an agressor nation in opposition to NATO.

An aggressor nation is generally defined as one that attacks other nations.
Since Kosovo was (and de jure still is) part of FRY, this claim falls flat.
Also, before the war began, it's still arguable whether the aggression was
more than counter-terrorist operations.  (Arguable, though not certain.)

The same applies to Kosovar Albanians, the KLA, and even Albania.

> Being
> given the opportunity to cooperate prior to the bombing

The cooperation was limited to accepting the agreement or being bombed.
That's not much more than pure coercion.  Notably, neither the Kosovar
Albanians nor the FRY had input into the drafting of the agreement.  This
was "take it or leave it" diplomacy.  (You might argue that the Serbian
government deserves no better, but the cost of such a stance is not only the
effort spent bombing, but also innocents being killed, both Serbian and
Albanian, etc.  Also, one might ask, did American negotiators really want an
agreement all sides could agree to that would protect Kosovar Albanians AND
address Serbian concerns about the KLA or was the goal to push Serbia into a
corner then bomb?)

Also, some of this is expected behavior.  Secessions on the whole are not
tolerated by whatever they are seceding from.  Note the cases of the
American Colonies seceding from Great Britain, the CSA seceding from the
USA, East Timor seceding from Indonesia, Chechnya seceding from Russia, and
the Kurds attempting to seceded from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran.  In all of
these cases, violent methods were used to suppress the rebellions.

This does not make such suppression good or right, but it's considered
natural behavior for nation states.  Ones that can't or won't do that,
generally, do not continue to exist for long.

(I'm generally pro-Secession, even in this case.  I'd like to see a
libertarian-minarchist government arise, not one that is merely ethnically
pure and oppresses whatever minorities exist within its borders.  No side
promises that.  Such a government would be ethnicity neutral, of course.  I
don't think the UN or NATO can make that happen.  I offer no plan for making
it happen, though I stress American taxpayers should not be used to pay for
such things anyway.)

> You really don't have much to stand on
> here trying to make Milosevic look like the victim.

I'm not trying to make Milosevic or the Serb government look like victims
here.  My goal is merely to give more evidence in this discussion.  I'm not
pro-Serb or pro-Milosevic.  At the same time, I do think the US and NATO got
involved in a basically counterproductive war where many innocents suffered.
Many more Albanians and Serbians died during the war.

I think NATO member populations were propagandized into accepting the war.
Surely, Milosevic and the Serbian government are not nice, good, just, etc.
But, at the same time, there are much worse problems in the world (Turkish
treatment of Kurds being perhaps the most glaring one, since Turkey is a
NATO member and a US client state) and I feel this was more Monica's War
than anything else.

But to be more constructive here: how would Extropians in general deal with
such problems?  One would hope our bright technological future would make
ethnic rivalries less a problem, yet the 1990s seemed like a time when both
technology progressed and ethnic rivalries and even wars increased.

Unfortunately it doesn't have the really important sensors that would
really reduce fees for safe drivers: traffic density sensors and blood
alcohol sensors. Without those two, you don't have much of a chance of
really saving much, because face it: everyone speeds. Some people only
speed when there is no traffic. Some people don't give other drivers
sufficient room and tend to tailgate. Those that speed in traffic and
don't give the old 'one one thousand, two one thousand' distance to
vehicles in front are the one's most likely to be in a collision, second
only to drunk drivers.

Thank you very much, Doug.  I sometimes can't resist joking around with
words which have two very different meanings, but I should learn to keep my

<dd>Claiming that Napster is &quot;operating as a haven for music=
 piracy,&quot; the recording industry sued in federal court to shut down the=
 hugely popular Internet-based music-sharing service. The Napster phenomenon=
 is only the most acute symptom of a technology-enabled revolution that is=
 undermining the foundations of traditional media. What does the Napster=
 saga tell us about the threat of the Internet to media incumbents? How will=
 creators and distributors of content get paid in the Internet Economy??</i>
</dl><font size=3D4 color=3D"#007EB0"><b>Issue</b></font> <br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3252"></a>Only the Beginning </b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3252"></a><br>
<br>
In December 1999, having grown increasingly concerned about the viral growth=
 of the Napster music-sharing system, the Recording Industry Association of=
 America (RIAA) filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the San Mateo,=
 California-based start-up, claiming that it is engaged in &quot;wholesale=
 piracy.&quot; On July 26, 2000, Federal District Court Judge Marilyn Hall=
 Patel granted a preliminary injunction requiring Napster to block all songs=
 owned by RIAA members from its service, but two days later the 9th Circuit=
 Court of Appeals granted a last-minute stay of the injunction. Barring=
 settlement, the case will go to trial in September. At least until the end=
 of that trial and the inevitable appeals, millions of Internet users around=
 the world will enjoy free access to an extraordinary library of digital=
 music. Millions of music consumers will have experienced the power of the=
 Internet to transform the experience of music consumption. <br>
<br>
The Napster phenomenon is the tip of an iceberg that will ultimately sink=
 many incumbent media firms. Napster is only the most visible example of how=
 the Internet and the digitization of content are transforming media. At the=
 most basic level, the digitization of content transforms it into a=
 commodity. Untethered from familiar physical forms like CDs and cassette=
 tapes, it is difficult for content creators and distributors to directly=
 capture revenue from content. The source of the value associated with the=
 digital file must become the experiences, the activities, and the=
 relationships wrapped around it. <br>
<br>
Established legal principles and business models are under attack. The=
 ability of content creators and packagers to extract value for their work=
 using traditional business models will continue to erode. The old media=
 companies who successfully make the transition to the digital world will=
 likely be those who wisely use the time bought by lawsuits and other=
 rearguard actions to ally with and reinvent themselves in the images of=
 upstarts like Napster whom they so aggressively resist today. <br>
<font size=3D4 color=3D"#007EB0"><b>Analysis</b></font><br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3253"></a>The Napster Conundrum </b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3253"></a><br>
<br>
In a 1992 essay entitled &quot;Selling Wine Without Bottles,&quot;=
 Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder and Grateful Dead lyricist John=
 Perry Barlow described the conundrum of digitized property. To Barlow, this=
 conundrum &quot;seems to be at the root of nearly every legal, ethical,=
 governmental, and social vexation to be found in the Virtual World.&quot;=
 Specifically, he wrote, &quot;the riddle is this: if our property can be=
 infinitely reproduced and instantaneously distributed all over the planet=
 without cost, without our knowledge, without its even leaving our=
 possession, how can we protect it? How are we going to get paid for the=
 work we do with our minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the=
 continued creation and distribution of such work?&quot; <br>
<br>
The digital property conundrum is now playing out with multi-billion-dollar=
 consequences for the recording industry. In fact, the issue of digital=
 property rights has repeatedly reared its head in the years since Barlow=
 wrote his essay, with each successive wave of growth in Internet users and=
 processing power raising the level of concern among content companies.=
 Napster with 20 million users and more than 850,000 music files consisting=
 of some 3,500 gigabytes of data has now made the issue of digital property=
 rights and business models the overriding concern of nearly everyone=
 associated with the music industry. As technologies mature, other forms of=
 media (e.g., video, print publishing) will face this conundrum as starkly=
 as the music industry faces it today. <br>
<br>
<h3><b>Napster and Its Cousins</b></h3><br>
<br>
Napster acts as an MP3 (Motion Picture Experts Group 1, Audio Layer 3)=
 search engine and distributed file management platform. Napster does not=
 store any MP3 files on its servers but enables users to make MP3 files on=
 their computers available to the Napster community as well as to perform=
 fast, simple searches to see which music files are available on the=
 computers of other Napster users. With a click of the mouse button, users=
 can then download music files from fellow Napster users' computers. <br>
<br>
MP3 is an open digital music format that compresses large audio files into=
 small, CD-quality files (although the person encoding the MP3 file can=
 choose the quality level depending on desired file size). The relatively=
 small file size makes this format attractive for uploading, downloading and=
 otherwise sharing over the Internet. In addition, millions of free and=
 shareware MP3 player and encoder applications are sitting on PCs around the=
 world, creating a huge installed base of users for the format and allowing=
 users to easily create high-quality MP3 files from their audio CDs. Because=
 MP3 does not incorporate rights management or encryption capabilities to=
 control copying of files, the music industry has sought to develop or back=
 alternatives that do incorporate such features. <br>
<br>
Even if the RIAA is successful in shutting down Napster, several=
 harder-to-control alternatives are waiting in the wings. The second most=
 popular music-sharing platform, Gnutella, provides similar capabilities to=
 those of Napster but without the &quot;weak link&quot; of a centralized=
 server. Freenet goes even further than Gnutella, providing a PC-to-PC=
 solution that passes requests through a number of computers, providing=
 complete anonymity to its users. <br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3254"></a>Music Sharing Platforms</b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3254"></a><br>
<br>
<font size=3D1>&nbsp;Source: Company information, The Industry Standard, May=
 8, 2000.WAP Forum</font><br>
<br>
Perhaps even more importantly, Napster and its file-sharing cousins are=
 precursors of a new form of distributed computing that will become=
 increasingly common as more and more computers are connected to the=
 Internet by always-on broadband connections. A number of firms are=
 developing technologies that enable general purpose file sharing across the=
 Internet supporting extremely reliable shared, distributed storage of all=
 types of content and applications. In time, most of the computing devices=
 on the planet will be knitted into an integrated fabric of processing and=
 storage resources that will create even greater challenges for those=
 seeking to maintain control over digital property. <br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3256"></a>Grassroots Innovation</b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3256"></a><br>
<br>
Like so many Internet phenomena, Napster is a grassroots innovation sprung=
 from the mind of a young consumer cobbling together an elegant solution to=
 a problem. Shawn Fanning was an 18-year-old freshman at Boston's=
 Northeastern University when he wrote the first version of the program.=
 <br>
<br>
The other current high-profile media industry lawsuit seeking to protect=
 digital property rights involves public distribution of the source code for=
 the CSS system created by a coalition of movie and technology interests to=
 prevent copying of DVD videos. This system was cracked by 15-year-old=
 Norwegian Jon Johansen as part of his effort to create a DVD video player=
 application for the open source Linux operating system. Johansen embarked=
 on this effort because the creators of CSS had not provided drivers=
 enabling users of the increasingly popular operating system to play DVD=
 videos. <br>
<br>
The Napster phenomenon yet again demonstrates the extraordinary power of the=
 Internet to foster innovation. It is unlikely that any coalition of music=
 industry players or technology vendors would ever have created a platform=
 like Napster, yet Napster elegantly addresses a number of key consumer=
 needs. Fanning and Johansen provide dramatic examples of the power that=
 technology has placed in the hands of consumers. Because of this power,=
 consumers are increasingly unwilling to wait for or accept inadequate=
 solutions from the traditional producers of content and technology. The=
 Internet, the processing power, and the communities of interest available=
 to individuals seeking to create solutions have enabled them to rapidly=
 create and disseminate significant innovations. This environment makes it=
 difficult for established firms to successfully lead innovation in the=
 marketplace and calls for new approaches to understanding and meeting=
 customer needs. <br>
<br>
<h3><b>&quot;A Match Made in Heaven&quot;</b></h3><br>
<br>
Edgar Bronfman Jr., who controls the world's biggest music company,=
 Universal Music Group, told an audience in March 2000 that &quot;Music and=
 the Internet are truly a match made in heaven.&quot; Bronfman is right, but=
 unfortunately for UMG many of the characteristics that make the match so=
 perfect tend to undermine its current business model. <br>
<br>
Listening to music is an emotional and a social experience. Musical tastes=
 are created and evolve based on a wide range of influences. The great=
 advantage of the major recording labels in the pre-Internet world was their=
 ability to leverage mass media to shape demand for their content. They are=
 masters of this marketing-driven or &quot;push&quot; model of demand=
 creation. They have effectively leveraged mass media to create the=
 motivations that lead consumers to buy particular types of music and=
 associate themselves with particular genres and artists. As masters of this=
 marketing engine, record labels have been in a position to be the key=
 gatekeepers for artists and entire genres of music. <br>
<br>
The marketing-driven business model of the current music industry is=
 necessary in a world where physical distribution channels are required to=
 deliver music into the hands of consumers. Everything from CD-manufacturing=
 capacity to shelf space in retail outlets is a limited, capital-intensive=
 resource for which demand must be effectively managed in order to create=
 acceptable returns on invested capital. Freed from these limitations by=
 digital files and the Internet, a very different music industry will=
 inevitably evolve. As Napster demonstrates, the mass marketing approach to=
 creating experiences around and demand for music will increasingly be=
 supplanted by a much more consumer-driven model. <br>
<br>
As a direct result of Moore's Law, increasingly powerful tools for creating=
 highly professional digital content (audio, video, digital photos, text,=
 multimedia) are now in the hands of the masses. With the Internet as an=
 extremely inexpensive means of distribution, vast quantities of this=
 digital content are reaching the public. While the artistic and=
 entertainment value of this content is uneven, the necessary gatekeeper=
 role played by old media in a world of capital-intensive production and=
 distribution resources is eroding. Consumers of content will increasingly=
 coalesce into more fragmented communities with closer relationships to the=
 creators of content. The roles of intermediaries between the creators and=
 consumers of content will change dramatically. <br>
<br>
Napster teaches us several important lessons about this new media=
 marketplace. Because musical tastes are personal, consumers require access=
 to a vast universe of choices. Because music is social, it must be easy for=
 consumers to share music with their friends. Because people like to listen=
 to music in a number of different contexts and on multiple devices, it must=
 be easy to move files between devices and locations. Consumers also need to=
 be able to listen to individual songs without feeling that the meter is=
 running. <br>

<br>
The Internet has changed the dynamics of diffusion of new technologies into=
 the marketplace. Even technologies that succeed require time and expensive=
 marketing to change consumer behavior. Exploiting Metcalfe's Law, Napster=
 has led to an extremely rapid diffusion of the MP3 format into the=
 marketplace. Other media technologies such as audio CDs took many more=
 years to reach the same levels of adoption in the marketpalce. Yet, relying=
 only on Internet-driven viral marketing, the number of Napster users has=
 grown from 1 million a year ago to more than 20 million today, with over 1=
 million joining each month. According to CyberDialogue, the number of=
 adults going online to get music content increased 48 percent between=
 December 1999 and March 2000.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Consumer Adoption of New Technologies</b></h3><br>
<br>
<font size=3D1>&nbsp;Source: McKinsey Quarterly, Number 2, 2000,=
 &quot;Unscrambling Digital TV&quot;.</font><br>
<br>
The greatest limitation of the MP3 format from a consumer standpoint is the=
 dependence of most users on their computers either to play the files=
 directly or to load them on to dedicated players. Dedicated MP3 players=
 like the Diamond Rio are increasingly popular while several new Microsoft=
 PocketPC devices like the Compaq iPaq incorporate MP3 players. MP3 players=
 are now available for automobiles and Ericsson has even demonstrated a=
 prototype mobile telephone handset that can play MP3s using a wireless link=
 to an add-on device. The desire of consumers to copy and synchronize music=
 files across multiple personal devices will be another important factor=
 limiting consumer acceptance of digital rights management systems that=
 limit copying of music files.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3258"></a>Recording Industry Blues </b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3258"></a><br>
<br>
Although the recording industry understands the power of the Internet and=
 the power of the consumer hunger for digital music, they are hesitant to=
 make any significant moves towards digital delivery. Everyone seems to=
 understand that digital music will mean the end of the old era. As Val=
 Azzoli, the co-chairman and co-CEO of the Atlantic Group put it in 1999:=
 &quot;I can't avoid [the Internet]. I wish it would go away, because it's a=
 pain in the ass. I don't want to retool my operation, but it's not going to=
 go away.&quot; <br>
<br>
Both global and the US music markets are dominated by 5 biggest players:=
 Universal, Sony, Warner, EMI and BMG, representing a collective $250=
 billion in market value. Although independent recording companies not owned=
 by a major label are slowly beginning to gain market share, at less than 20=
 percent in 1999, they are yet to become a major threat to the Big Five.=
 <br>
<br>
Like any industry, the recording industry is the sum of its history. That=
 history has led to a complex, multi-layered structure in which many=
 incumbent players are struggling to protect significant established=
 economic interests. <br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3260"></a>Traditional Music Value Chain</b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3260"></a><br>
<br>
<font size=3D1>Source: IDC, Mainspring.</font><br>
<br>
This complex industry structure can be mapped back to the cost of the=
 typical CD that a consumer buys in a music retailer. <br>
<br>
<h3><b>CD Economics</b></h3><br>
<br>
<font size=3D1>Source: RCA, via &quot;RCA Records: The Digital=
 Revolution&quot;, HBS Case Study 9-800-014, rev. Oct.1999.</font><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Estimates by Billboard suggest that for a typical $17 CD, distribution,=
 shipping, and store markup account for more than $9.50 of the retail price.=
 All of this analysis shows how much of the cost of a CD is consumed by the=
 processes and bottlenecks created by today's physical distribution=
 infrastructure. If you remove these processes, the costs are dramatically=
 reduced. For example, Yankee Group estimates that the cost to send a song=
 directly over the Internet is $1 and rapidly dropping. <br>
<br>
In addition to these obvious costs, almost all of today's mass market=
 consumer media are classic hit-driven businesses where huge sums of money=
 are spent to create hits. For every hit though, there are a lot of money=
 losers. To mitigate some of this risk, content distributors increasingly=
 rely on focus groups and other tools to create content and even artists=
 with a greater likelihood of creating hits. This model manifests itself in=
 artists like the Backstreet Boys who are carefully crafted by marketers to=
 generate instant hits among target demographic groups. <br>
<br>
<h3><b><a name=3D"3262"></a>Legal Codes and Moral Rights</b></h3><a=
 name=3D"3262"></a><br>
<br>
&quot;Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or expanded=
 to contain the gasses of digitized expression any more than real estate law=
 might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting spectrum. (Which,=
 in fact, rather resembles what is being attempted here.) We will need to=
 develop an entirely new set of methods as befits this entirely new set of=
 circumstances.&quot; - John Perry Barlow <br>
<br>
The most visible action taken by the recording industry in response to the=
 rapid spread of digital music has been to turn to the courts. In recent=
 months, the RIAA has filed a number of suits against firms facilitating the=
 sharing of MP3s. These suits follow an earlier, failed attempt by the RIAA=
 to prohibit the sale of the Diamond Rio MP3 player in the U.S. <br>
<br>
<h3><b>Recent RIAA Lawsuits</b></h3><br>
<br>
<font size=3D1>Source: RIAA, via The Industry Standard, August 7,=
 2000.</font><br>
<br>
The RIAA's case against Napster is not a slam dunk because while Napster=
 facilitates the distribution of music files in violation of the rights of=
 many copyright holders, the actual digital songs that are being downloaded=
 are located on servers that have no connection to Napster. Napster argues=
 that it is just providing a software application that end users are using=
 to share music files non-commercially. The RIAA has to prove Napster is=
 inducing illegal activity. What's more, the RIAA will have to prove that=
 Napster is used almost exclusively for illegal activity, and Napster=
 clearly provides access to content whose copyright holders wish to be=
 distributed on the platform. Some observers don't buy the Napster argument,=
 though. Music agent Ron Stone says that &quot;It's like they [Napster] are=
 selling crack pipes to crack heads and making believe they aren't=
 contributing to the problem.&quot; <br>
<br>
In the U.S., the 1909 Copyright Act laid the foundation of our current=
 system of awarding composers a royalty each time a song is carried on a=
 record or other format that can be replayed mechanically. As content is=
 increasingly taking a digital form, laws designed to preserve rights in the=
 physical expression of ideas are becoming increasingly difficult to apply.=
 The Napster conflict is a perfect example of the challenges of trying to=
 force a new technology into old law. <br>
<br>
In addition to the legal issues is the moral issue of the rights of artists=
 to control the fruits of their creativity and get paid for them. Napster's=
 success does not necessarily mean that consumers wish to willfully infringe=
 the rights of artists. Consumer anger over the price of CDs seems more to=
 be generated by disgust at subsidizing the expensive stream of middlemen,=
 promoters and lawyers driving up the cost of final products. Artists'=
 opinions about Napster vary. Many, often more established musicians,=
 contend that such programs are robbing them of their royalties. Sean=
 &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs says the program is a form of &quot;abuse,&quot;=
 while Scott Stapp, lead singer for Creed, says that Napster is=
 &quot;robbing me blind.&quot; Meanwhile, many others see it as a way around=
 the corporate gatekeepers who have prohibited them from reaching a broader=
 audience. <br>
<br>
Finally, the RIAA claims that Napster poses a threat to sales of recorded=
 music but so far the evidence is mixed. Although a May study by SoundScan=
 reported that sales of CDs were down in stores near colleges, blaming=
 Napster for the dip, the RIAA's own statistics for 1999 demonstrate clear=
 growth in both overall music industry sales and revenues. Moreover, a July=
 study by Jupiter Communications reported that Napster users are 45 percent=
 more likely to purchase music because digital music swapping is a catalyst=
 to buying music that they would not otherwise have discovered. <br>

<br>
If Napster heralds the eventual end of old media, what is the endgame for=
 the incumbent firms in the old media value chain? Is it possible to make=
 money in the age of digital content? <br>
<br>
The good news is that old media is not going away any time soon. A vast=
 installed base of consumers for old media in all of its forms exists and=
 will continue to generate revenues for years to come. In fact, in the near=
 term, digital media may (as suggested by the Jupiter study of Napster=
 users) actually drive an uptake in sales through traditional media=
 channels. The challenge for old media players is not to allow stable or=
 even growing revenues from traditional media to lull them into inaction. To=
 remain viable on the other side of this disruptive set of market=
 developments, old media players will have to dramatically rethink and=
 recast their roles. While technology investments, experimentation, and=
 partnerships will be important, the biggest steps that many incumbent media=
 players will have to take involve systematically rethinking their value=
 propositions and how they will communicate those value propositions to=
 their customers. <br>
<br>
This means, too, that incumbent media firms need to focus on improving=
 operational efficiencies within their existing businesses. There is no room=
 for waste in this evolving economy. The pressures are greater than ever to=
 build flat, efficient organizations where every costs are aggressively=
 controlled. <br>
<br>
<b>Get to Know Your Customers <br>
</b><br>
The balance of power has shifted dramatically in favor of consumers. More=
 than ever before, media creators and distributors need to develop strong=
 relationships with their customers and work relentlessly to meet their=
 expectations. The world in which the push, marketing-driven model gave=
 content creators significant power to influence consumer demand are over.=
 <br>
<br>
<b>Establish a Meaningful Brand <br>
</b><br>
Old media players need to start creating brands that have meaning for their=
 consumers. Traditionally, most media brand building has focused on branding=
 artists and individual pieces of content. If the recording labels want to=
 have any relevance, they are going to have to educate consumers about who=
 they are and the value they do provide. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Napster battle has raised the profiles of the recording=
 labels in a largely negative manner. Scott Rosenberg of Salon.com strikes a=
 note typical of the wide-spread public attitude towards the record=
 companies when he writes that through the legal battle &quot;the=
 brain-dead, colossally wasteful, artistically homogenizing old order of the=
 recording industry is committing collective, time-delayed suicide in=
 court.&quot; <br>
<br>
It is not that the record labels do not perform services or value to=
 consumers, but most consumers don't have a clue what they really do or what=
 value they add. A lot of consumers are getting to know the recording=
 industry players right now for the first time and they are forming some=
 negative impressions. <br>
<br>
<b>Explore New Revenue Models</b> <br>
<br>
As one poster wrote in an Internet news group, &quot;Music companies will=
 find new financial sources; there is no other way. The faster they change,=
 the easier they will cope with the new reality.&quot; The models of how to=
 get paid in this new world are out there. In the long run, it will be=
 easier for the artists to get paid than the middlemen, because most of what=
 the middlemen do will be cut out by digital distribution. Looking to other=
 industries, like the IT channel, for example, we can see how new models=
 remove huge chunks of revenue from channel players while delivering even=
 greater value to consumers. A subscription model, for example, might mean=
 that tens of billions of dollars of revenues evaporate, while artists=
 actually receive greater compensation, although artists' revenue will be=
 shared among a greater number of artists.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most intriguing set of models for getting paid in this=
 environment comes from the Open Source software movement, where firms like=
 Red Hat software have figured out how to get paid for selling software that=
 anyone can get for free from multiple alternative sources. Many of these=
 players have consciously copied the models created by firms that have built=
 successful businesses selling commodity products like soap, tomato paste,=
 and gasoline. Creating a meaningful brand and wrapping a set of services=
 around the product are key in this type of environment. With digital=
 content, a player that can enable consumers to find the precise content=
 that they want when they need it and ensure that it is delivered in the=
 appropriate format and that desired quality standards are met, has the=
 opportunity to still make money from the sale of the content. <br>

I believe the American Atheists site has an archive of their public access

I think the idea is wonderful.  Might also prove to be a useful training

Yet it is surrounded by NATO members, who have wound up paying the cost
of the refugee problem created by Serbia's racist policies. Because of
this unconsented imposition of externalities, Serbia brought NATO on
itself.

Serbia had, at that point, established a consistent record of backing,
supporting, and committing genocide, ethnic cleansing, and all around
general anti-democratic gestapo tactics in violation even of its own
laws. While it is arguable that the KLA received backing from underworld
figures in Albania, that is really irrelevant. The ethnic Albanians
raised and living in Kosovo had been under an organized campaign of
prejudice, segregation, oppression and persecution ever since Milosevic
took power in the 80's and made his famous speech in Kosovo that he
would take back Kosovo for the Serbians. Given such a high level of
approval for anti-albanian activities by serbs in kosovo, it is only
natural that albanians would turn to their countrymen for support
against such persecution. Terrorists are only terrorists to those who
wish to wipe them out and those who buy into the propaganda of the
opressors. As has been learned in Ireland, Isreal, and elsewhere, the
easiest and least bloody way to deal with terrorists is to try to remove
the reasons why terrorists engender support. Now, terrorists are called
terrorist because they attack and engeder fear in a civilian population.
The KLA never attacked civilians prior to the NATO action, they focused
only on government police, soldiers, and politicians. These are not acts
of terrorists, but of guerrillas fighting an insurgency war. The only
people who committed terrorist acts against civilians in Kosovo were the
Serbs.

This is a good question to ask, especially its being so concurrent with
the scandals that Clinton was going through at the time. However, it is
my opinion that while Clinton definitely had an interest in deflecting
attention away from himself, there was a just and real reason to go into
Kosovo. If I were a NATO peacekeeper, I can tell you I would not go in
unless I had AT LEAST the sort of conditions set forth in the
Ramboulliet agreement.

This is clearely unsupportable in the current day, given the excellent
example of Czhechoslovakia breaking up quite peacefully into Slovakia
and the Czhech Republic. The Soviet Union also broke up rather
peacefully, surprise surprise. I personally expected that to be a
bloodbath. Then you've also got Canada going through the process of
breaking off Nunavut at the present moment, with scarcely a ripple that
you have not heard anything about it in the news in months, and most of
the rest of english speaking Canada secretly wishes that Quebec would go
ahead and secede, just so they can get that damn welfare case off their
backs. You've also got Britain slowly going through the motions of
breaking up so peacefully and politely hardly anyone has a bad thing to
say about it. The Scots and Welsh are so  damn happy to have their own
parliaments now they sure as hell can't say anything bad about London.
Hell, the Scots got their stone back too.

I don't think you can make any sort of representations over how many
died versus how many WOULD HAVE DIED if Milosevic and his Tigers had
been allowed a free reign to commit widespread genocide across Kosovo. I
personally think that despite the number who died, more would have died
if we had not gone in, and those that woud have died would have all been
Albanians, while at least this way the Serbian civilians that have
approved all this bullshit have finally had to pay some price for their
bigotry.

Turkish repression of Kurds is likely to remain on the back burner until
the problems of Isreal/Palestine and Iraq are resolved. The Turkish
people are getting more and more fundamentalist, and it may become more
of a problem in the next several years, however I am hoping that the
continuing moderation of Iran will decrease the support for
fundamentalist groups around the arab world.

Governments and multinational corps have used advancing technologies to
try to make the world a smaller place. They need to realize that people
suffer from the same psychological pressures you see in the rat
experiment, and when there is the perception that people are closer
together and there is pressure for conformity, there will be increased
pressure by individuals to push people farther apart and be unique. We
all have to have our own space, our comfort zone. We are not domestic
animals.

Well, it looks like Steve Moyer is gonna have me on his radio show in
Burlington, VT on thursday afternoon (thats when the taping is, at
least, not sure if its live). The show is Election 2000, and it turns
out Steve is running as an independent against Senator Jeffords for the
US Senate, and he host other politicians and pundits on his show. We've
been talking over email about ethanol technology, education, health
care, and other issues. One thing that interested him was the idea I had
suggested that since many grain silos around the country tend to wind up
with grain just rotting because the market  price is too low, that
installing small 'microbrew' type ethanol distilleries at grain silos to
supply local demand for fuel while helping to stabilize the grain market
at the same time by eliminating any surpluses of unsalable grain might
be a good market solution to the need for lower cost fuels and eliminate
the need for subsidy. I'm aware that using standard
fermentation/distillation sytems probably has significant losses. Spike,
didn't you do some calculations on conversion of grain to ethanol a
short while back? What conversion efficiency were you talking about and
what technology were you basing that on? Are you aware of any
technologies that would be more efficient than yeast based fermentation?

Ditto.

My understanding is that some cultures.....American Indian in
particular......had childhood names and then ........upon adulthood....an
adult name.  Popular wisdom has it that the adult name had something to do
with that individuals characteristic one way or another....

Even today......to a lesser extent......such naming is existant.  For
example....on the CB there are "handles" (I'm Lobo by the way).......and on
the internet ......particularly in Chatrooms there are ScreenNames (in some
of which I am LoboTruck)........

Possibly this self nameing reflects a real or imagined characteristic......

I agree...but i also think that the reverse (obverse?...converse?) should
also be the case...that is...that it should be a constitutional right that
bodily modifications ......IF DESIRED.......should be allowed.

I will say this about it, I can only speak for myself.  I have no problems with implants
per se or other modifications to one's own body cosmetic or not.  The ability to replace
lost limbs with advanced prosthetics alone shows the good side of the science of modifying
the body.  Maybe someday accident survivors might even grow their lost limbs back.

About implants in society, it is an economical and preferential change before people agree
to many surgical implants.  For instance, on the Internet today, do people use the
electronic gold and cybercash to buy things?  No, they use their credit card.  If your
grocery store gave away free implants next week that gave a 25% discount on groceries,
would you get one?  These are examples of what optional implants might do.

Implants that are not only "cosmetic" in that they affect the human body in direct ways are
probably considered medical devices and thus doctor license rules apply to be able to
surgically install implants, or for them otherwise to be "non-prescription", as it were.

So, implants might be seen as dangerous.  For example, if many people got implants, for
various reasons, it would not take long before that demand created varying suppliers of
implants with various levels of technical quality and reliability not to mention what other
health factors of its use might apply.  We've seen with breast implants that various
methods were used, and some were faulty, so peoples' lives were damaged and there were
lawsuits.  Heart regulators and other surgical implants such as pins and screws in bone
operations are pretty regular, I am no doctor.

There are basically these types of implants:  cosmetic, medical (to strictly replace a body
function), locality (an ID on the person), or performance enhancing or enabling.  There
would be combinations of these types of implants.

The locality based implants (any word) are those we discuss in terms of Orwellian style
chip implants with anything besides an anonymous identifier.  For example, some cattle are
tagged with GPS devices, normally cosmetically enough in their ear.  Some people have put
implants in their pets, and some might consider it for theselves or loved ones for various
purposes, such as getting oneself directions and things like that.

Performance enabling or enhancing implants might accomplish many various purposes.

I forget who posted it, but someone on this list had an excellent suggestion 
of genetic engineering to cause sterilization so that the species is 
naturally sterile, and then taking a pill which will temporarily induce 
fertility when you want to have children.
There is the worry that this just means the people who are too careless (or 
something else) to get the procedure are the ones whose genes will be passed 
on to future generations. I agree - but who cares? What's important is me 
and my control of my own self and destinty, not the future of the species.

I've been thinking of switching recently - either to my middle name, or
to something completely new, like "Ben Abard".  (Short, easy to spell,
and close to the beginning of the alphabet.)

Partially this is because my current name is so hard to pronounce.  But
the other reason is a harsh necessity for all children of the digital

Wh ohas the time to dig through all that ancient history?  Aside from that,
think of it as a public document of your continued growth and change.  It
would be interesting if we could get a glimpse into people in former ages
like that.  (Still, we have to dig though a lot of useless stuff to get to
the gems, even today, especially since we are drowning in the former.  Which
brings up another issue: Does society today produce better works than in
former times now that the barriers for entry are much lower?)

Of course, you still decide what to send...  So it's still biased.  Where's
Zero and ubiquitous surveillance?:)

Four problems with statement.  One, almost all if Serbia's neighbors are not
NATO members -- Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia,
Romania.  The only NATO member next door to Serbia is Hungary and that's
only an associate member.  (Note also that Macedonia gave a cold shoulder to
Kosovar refugees.)

Two, the Kosovar refugee problem starting only after the bombs began
dropping.  Recall, the "genocide" that took place in Kosovo totalled under
60 deaths.  Granted, any death is bad, but this hardly smacks of genocide
and looks more like what the Serbians originally said, viz.,
counter-terrorism and police operations.  (If you disagree, then remember
three things.  First, Serbia, then and now, had the military might to kill a
lot more people.  Second, why weren't there huge refugee movements before
the bombing began.  Did the Kosovar Albanians only decide to start fleeing
when the bombs started to drop?  Third, where is the evidence for
pre-bombing mass graves in Kosovo?)

Posen, in "The War for Kosovo: Serbia's Political-Military Strategy"
(_International Security_ 24(4)), thinks the refugee problem during the war
might have been an attempt by Serbia to stop the war.  How?  By sending
refugees to neighboring countries, it might have been thought, this would
make it seem like the war would cause more problems than otherwise for NATO.
If that was the plan, it did not work as, except for NATO bombing refugees
and getting flack for that, it only made Serbia look worse in world opinion
AND also made it less likely that NATO bombs would fall on Kosovar
Albanians.

Third, refugees really only become a problem because of statist policies.
If one does not force people to pay for refugees, but allows private aid to
them, then they do not become an externality.  It's only the welfare-statist
who can see them as a problem.

Four, some of Serbia's neighbors are basically racist -- using "racist" to
cover all forms of militant ethnocentrism here -- such as Croatia and
Macedonia.  The Croatian leadership has have proven time and again, through
both internal policy and external war (in Bosnia) to be so.  Macedonia is
mainly interested in keeping itself Macedonian, one reason why its
government gave Kosovar Albanians the cold shoulder.

The Balkans and most of the world for that matter is not antiracist.  In
fact, the lesson of the post-Cold War era seems to be that a lot of peoples
just barely got along and that the general tendency is, sadly, for
ethnically pure realms, whether that be in the Balkans, Germany (which has
its racist problems against Turkish immigrants), the Russian "near abroad"
(former Soviet Republics which have large ethnically Russian populations),
Canada (not just Quebec, but also Native Americans), Nigeria, Rwanda, or
Indonesia.  Serbia is merely the nation that's been singled out, while a lot
of U.S. allies (Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria) get a free pass.  (Surely, you
can bring up counterexamples, but how many of them are neighbors of Serbia?
How many of them are there compared with the rest of the world's nations?)

In Kosovo, there is no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing prior to the
NATO air campaign.  In fact, the death toll was extremely small and limited
to areas where the KLA operated.  That sort of makes it look like, in this
case, Serbia was not doing all the things you say it was.  (This does not
excuse other cases, of course, but it does make me want to look more closely
at them.  Are you going to accept the U.S. State Department's view of
everything here?  According to them, the U.S. and its allies are always in
the right and every war they fight is a just war.  Do you agree?)

Also, if you are really against this sort of thing, then when will call for
the bombing of Croatia, which has a similar record of genocide and ethnic
cleansing, especially of Serbs?  It was also deeply involved in Bosnia at
one point.  And it's record of doing this dates back to World War Two.
(That said, I'm not for bombing Croatia.  Too many innocents, again, would
be killed or harmed and the policy changes probably wouldn't come about.
Serbia today is no better as a country for the bombings -- in terms of its
government's policies.)

I don't completely disagree with this picture of the origin of the KLA,
though the KLA itself seemed more interested before, during, and after the
war with obtaining power than liberating Albanians living in Kosovo.  (Maybe
this is the way it is with most paramilitary groups.)  Also, there was an
Albanian President of Kosovo, but he was marginalized by the KLA -- because
he was not pushing for independence and also because he sought change
through democratic means.  (These were the reasons given, in my
recollection, in TV and radio news before and during the war.)

Debatable.  I suppose what you mean is not against those who wish to wipe
out the terrorist group, but the larger group the terrorists claim to
represent or protect.  That said, terrorism has no valid justification.
True, in some cases, the label "terrorist" is used against anyone who uses
force against the government, but general terrorist tactics are to attack
noncombatants, such as when a bazaar is bombed in Jerusalem.  Innocents are
killed.

Whether the KLA was doing that in Kosovo is another story.  I'm not sure and
I bet you don't know either.

But when?  During the war, yes.  However, a lot of that was probably because
the Serbian army then was openly fighting the KLA and attacking towns and
villages with impunity.  Before the war, the story looks very different.  If
not, where's your evidence?  Where are the pre-war mass graves, the prewar r
efugees?

The actual agreement in force is not the same as the original Rambouillet
Agreement.  In fact, the notorious Appendix B has been changed.  The
occupation force is limited to Kosovo and does not have a free reign in the
rest of FRY.  Also, the timetable for an independence vote has been removed
and the operation is under UN Security Council control.  In other words,
Serbia held out for something and they did win some concessions, though at
great cost.

[For those who want to see the original agreement, it's at
http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html]

Most likely Milosevic would not be able to remain in power if the original
Appendix B was left in, agreed to, and enforced.  I don't mean NATO would
have overthrown him.  Instead, his support would have dried up and his
opposition gotten stronger.  Don't forget, Serbia is not Iraq.  Milosevic
still has to justify himself to parliament and the populace.  He still has
to keep his coalition happy -- or, at least, not unhappy enough to stop
supporting him.

Me too.

But it only supports my claim above.  Nation states that do not suppress
secession cease to be.  The Soviet Union ceased to be.  Czechoslovakia
ceased to be.  If you're a nation state and you don't force parts of you to
stick together, then, in general, they will leave as soon as the level of
comfort declines enough.

And don't take my comments the wrong way.  I'm not for suppression.  I'm
just making an observation.  Note also that my comments cover your examples,
while yours do not cover mine.

That posits that Serbs who died or otherwise paid as well as others who died
or otherwise paid for this deserve that.  Since to an outsider it appears
you've done nothing material, so far as I know, to revolt against the U.S.
government for, say, its various unjust policies, from its war on drugs to
its support of genocidal leaders in Turkey, Indonesia, throughout Latin
America and Africa, would it be all right if you were killed?  After all,
shouldn't you be made to pay the price for American policies?  (I disagree,
of course.  And by no means do I imply any subject or citizen of a nation
state should be held responsible for his or her governments actions --
unless he or she is part of that government.)

Some think Turkey might be the next Iran.  However, if bombing works so
well, why not bomb Turkey?  Why let the Turkish government continue its
brutal repression of the Kurdish people.  You appear to have a ho hum
attitude here.  Kurds are dying and the U.S. government even gives money and
weapons to their killers.  The Serbs are different, right?  Why?  (This is
strange, since Turkey is the product of the Ottoman Empire disintegrating,
which also set the chessboard for the Balkans and the Middle East in the
20th century.  _The Peace to End All Peace_, as one fine book on the subject
is titled!)

In other words, when does your "just and real reason" to intervene
militarily come into affect?  It appears from the way you're applying this
notion, you're only using it to justify stuff ad hoc and after the fact.
Would you be clear about when it's okay to use force and when it's not in
these cases and why?

But back to more constructive stuff here, how can we minimize the influence
of bad elements here?

I think humans are a bit different than rats, else every major metropolitan
area would explode in violence.  We don't see that, especially with the very
low violent crime rates in many large US cities, such as NYC.  New Jersey is
also the most densely populated US State, e.g., yet the level of violence is
extremely low compared to the Balkans.  Of course, maybe your qualifying
factors are intervening in these cases.  How would you account for it?

And some might call a lot of this technology is what Bruce Sterling dubbed
"enforcement technology" -- i.e., stuff that makes it easier to divide and
conquer, then unite and rule -- not necessarily liberating technology.  (Of
course, I'd disagree because I believe the user decides whether to use a
computer to, say, hold a discussion like this one or to put a database of
undesireables in it.)

We should probably split this into two threads.  A strictly Kosovo one and
another devoted to what we should do in general.  Perhaps if anyone else
decides to chime in.

Cheers!

Change it if you must, Eliezer, but make the new name at least as
interesting as your present one.

Yes, it indicates that we're all (more or less) susceptible to mass socio-genic
illness. It seems to me a potent element of extropy involves the process by
which social organizations recover from damage done by ideologues, demagogues,
and theologues.

How about a gadget that can immunize folks against infectious and entropic memes
such as those which have acted against John Stossel (or Galileo, for that
matter).

Rand must be turning in her grave for sure now - defended by a Kantian 
argument!!!  As you probably know, she considered Kant to be thoroughly evil 
and his philosophy utterly anti-human.  Nonetheless, with much trepedition 
and foreboding in anticipation of wasted time, I have to say that yours is 
the first post I've noticed on this thread that actually bears on the 
fundamental issue raised - is there such a thing as actual selfishness?  Or 
is it merely indistinguishable from "intent."

Clearly, without a referent independent of the subjective intent of the 
person, whatever the person chooses to do must be considered to be selfish.  
If "selfishness" is to have content, it must be possible to be unselfish.  
To say that selfish actions have as their intended benficiary the actor 
himself merely puts the same logical obstacle one step further away in the 
logical chain.  It is only when one poses an external referent - external to 
the will - as the determining quality that selfishness becomes meaningful.

Rand herself gets into this line of argumentation in "The Fountainhead" as I 
recall, when one of the characters is admonished by one of the villians 
against enjoying her good works.  If she enjoys it, then it wasn't truly 
selfless after all, and she's just cheating.  Only if you act without 
desire, without pleasure, without the anticipation of a desired outcome, can 
you be truly "selfless."  But are "selfless" and "selfish" opposites?

The next question, however, is: If selfishness is distinguished from 
unselfishness by some objective criteria, then, nevertheless, what 
difference could it possibly make?  Suppose I come up to you and say, "Bad, 
Daniel, bad, bad!  You weren't being selfish.  And I can prove it by 
reference to 'The Objective Rules for Being Selfish,' vol. VI, Pg. 397."  
And you agree!  How could you have done any differently if you always act in 
every circumstance with the intent of achieving a better state?

Ah, but you do act differently with different knowledge...  The "will" does 
not exist as a floating abstraction independent of input.  The only rational 
critique I can make then is that on some level you were ignorant of what was 
truly, really, objectively in your true, real, objective self-interest.  
Rand's position, then, boils down to a rejection of any argument that starts 
out postulating that one should act against one's self-interest, and then, 
like Aristotle, laying out what constitutes, in principle, what objectively 
is in your self-interest.  I.e., what are values, why they have that 
characteristic, how to identify them in reality, how to rank them, what 
methods and habits of behavior - virtues - are most likely to achieve a life 
filled with real values.

If, as Rand argues, man - or any uploaded or SI progeny he may produce - has 
a specific nature - like every other thing in the universe - then he needs 
specific kinds of things to survive as the kind of being he is.  That 
objective reality is the foundation for any discussion of objective value 
and thus what really constitutes selfishness.

Nice!  Now the next trick will be to get the absolute best egg cells to 
start with.  I mean the ones that have the really dynamite mitochondria.  
There is an enormous variation in mitochondrial efficiency, and specific 
mitochondrial lines have been closely correlated with life expectancy.  So 
you find the best ones and put in an ideal mix of several top strains, and 
you've got the next FloJo.
Or, in the case of the potential for tissue/organ replacement, you put in a 
new heart that is seen as yours by your immune system, but it runs at 
olympic athlete levels.

Eliezer,

I think your present name is very cool and you should keep it.  It simply has a charm and so losing it would be a shame.  

But if you have to change it why not follow FM-2030's example...  For instance you could be known from now on as SM-2035.  Singularity Man of the year 2035.  I'm sure you could come up with something even better if you needed to.


best wishes,

John

You might want to talk to Carel Struycken, the actor who played Lurch in the 
Adams Family movies, and also Mr. Homm in TNG, and the pawn broker in B5.  
Carel - last time I spoke with him - was producing/directing a series for 
Dutch television on cutting edge breakthru technologies.  He is certainly 
aware of and seems generally sympathetic to extropian ideas.  Carel created 
the first digital post movie studio in Hollywood before he got hooked into 
acting, and he programs virtual reality environments for therapy for 
recovering disabled people in his spare time.

Unfortunately, I'm still in a FAQ... a FAQ that is multiply archived and
regularly reposted.

It seems likely that changing your name at age twenty or so will
eventually become a commonly observed custom of the digital age,
Singularity permitting.  Of course, we haven't heard Broderick's side of
the story, yet...

So, how about a general contract that you sign in order to do business on 
the Web?  Nobody forces you to sign.  You can do business elsewhere or with 
non-signatories on competing e-services if there are any available.  But if 
you do sign you get access to the majority, let's say, of the world's 
commerce without having to post separate bonds with every transaction.  
Since you're covered under the general contract, everyone knows that it's 
safe to do business with you, but included in that contract is a provision 
for the respect of intellectual property, under some form of free-market 
copyright or patent provision.  Could you have any legitimate objection to 
such a system?

seeing it at shows for years, but the release date was always 3 months away, 
no matter when you asked.  So it's actually out there now?

I changed my name at sixteen, after a major epiphany\apostasy of sorts;
unfortunately, I may have changed it too soon, as like Eli, there are a few
slightly embarassing things I published on or about the net at that age.  I
would change it again, however, I think I am a bit too well known to do so
without alienating at least some of my audience\readers.

I'm no expert on GATT but I very much doubt the treaty says that, not that it would

Easy to do? I think not, it would be almost as hard as making an effective

Wow, I'm so excited about all this new surveillance and intelligent
implant technology.  The wonderful possibilities are endless.  Just
think, as these implants get more sophisticated, they will be able to
control every mood and thought we have. Besides giving us the medication
we need for any medical problems, the Omni-Net(TM) will detect when we
get depressed and signal our implants to release anti-depressants into
our bloodstream.  If the Omni-Net(TM) detects that we're getting angry
(which could definitely be a menace to society), it will release
sedatives into our bloodstream.  No more blow-ups, no more Columbines,
no more LA riots.

Just think, no more angry people in the world!  Everyone will be just
like Barney, happy happy, joy joy!  The world will become one big
playground where everyone is hormonally regulated to remain in a normal
and serene state.  We'll all be happy.  The societal benefits and
economic incentives  will be huge.  No more crime, no more hostility,
people buying consumer goods dictated to them by the companies
themselves, as consumers increasingly get all the techno-goodies it
wanted at a discount!  Meanwhile the companies that make them will see
their revenues go through the roof!

Lets face it, freedom is bad for business.  Rome got at least one thing
right - Slavery.  But this time we can do it right.  We can learn from
books like 1984, and Brave New World.  We can get it right this time -
because now we have the technology, we can re-build people into the
Omni-Net(TM).  Now we can all become 6 million dollar consumers!

Boy, what a great time to be alive!  Yipee!

Great!  You mean I can give up all my freedoms and privacy, have complete and
total surveillance over my entire life, camera's in my bedroom, a totalitarian
status quo dictating every thing I do - and I don't have to pay anything?!  Wow,
you mean, they will even pay me for this?!  That's great!  I get to be a slave
to the corporations and the government and as a courtesy for my obedience
they'll even give me discounts on consumer goods!  God, what a great time to be
alive!

Wow, I shouldn't panic about all this, because its only going to get worse!
This is such great news.  Pretty soon they will even know what I'm thinking.
What a great society it's going to be - complete mind control over of all its
citizens.  With nobody behaving or thinking outside of the status quo,
everything will become safe and cuddly.  I can't wait!  I won't have to worry or
even think about anything else every again.  The nanny state is going to put me
into a cushy cocoon in which all my actions and thinking will be controlled by
them. Ahh, the bliss!  Bring on the ID implants, the omni-surveillance, and
don't forget those great discounts!!!

What, you mean the die dinosaur anti-acid rock posts?  We liked those! {8^D

I took up using the name spike after someone at work started calling me

Ja, but it was just a back of the envelope calc.  I got the numbers
from a site that was unapologetically pro-farm.  For instance, they
often used the phrase "will help corn prices" and "improve corn
prices" to mean *increase* the price.  {8^D

> What conversion efficiency were you talking about and
> what technology were you basing that on?

All standard nothing-tricky today-tech, no GM.  In rough numbers it
was 150 bushels per acre-year, 2.5 gallons ethanol per bushel,
then figuring closed loop (using ethanol in the harvesting, processing,
water delivery and fermentation etc, you get about 38% as I
recall, so it comes out to about a gallon per bushel of corn or
about 150 gallons per acre year, which in understandable units
comes to about 1400-ish liters per hectare year.  So I figure
all the land under cultivation in the US, if planted in corn and
fermented would take care of about a third of our energy use,
which gave me a new respect for how much energy we devour.
Those were outdated (1989) numbers for energy use, and
Barbara pointed out that it is probably higher now with the
popularity of Detroit urban assault vehicles.

I did have a kind of disturbing thought about this as I imagined
converting some of the unused American open space into
corn fields: if we did do something like that, we might need to
come up with some tricky new technology to kill birds!  Perhaps
a radar tracking system with a pulse laser or something.  The
greens wouldnt like that one damn bit.  Im thinking something
like that could be adapted for popping locusts outta the air too,
which actually sounds like it would be kinda cool to work on.
Our military high energy lasers and tracking systems could be
adapted I would think.  I havent a guess on how to keep the
green vandals from destoying the things.

Im looking at buying a hybrid car.

Havent looked into it.  How about if you find us a site with
some numbers?  spike

Honestly!  Friends, a little embarrassment is *good for you*, it really
is.  Helps burn off some of that excess dignity, lets you avoid taking
yourselves too seriously, and... it helps lesser mortals relate to you
as real people.  Dont worry about what you posted as teenagers.

Soya alert over cancer
and brain damage link

Special report: what's wrong with our food?

by Antony Barnett, public affairs editor
Sunday August 13, 2000

A health warning was sounded last night over the
dangers of eating soya after two senior American
government scientists revealed that chemicals in the
product could increase the risk of breast cancer in
women, brain damage in men and abnormalities in
infants.

The disclosure, which sent shockwaves through the
multi-billion dollar food industry, came after the
scientists decided to break ranks with colleagues in
the US Food and Drug Administration and oppose its
decision last year to approve a health claim that
soya reduced the risk of heart disease. They wrote
an internal protest letter warning of 28 studies
revealing toxic effects of soya.

In an interview with The Observer, one of the
scientists, Daniel Doerge, an expert on soya, said:
'We have very real worries that this health claim will
be used by the industry as an endorsement of much
wider health benefits to soya beyond the heart.
Research has shown a clear link between soya and
the potential for adverse effects in humans.'

BSE and other health scares related to meat have led
to rocketing sales of soya-related products in Britain.
But it is not just vegetarian foods such as tofu that
use soya. It is a key ingredient in products from meat
sausages and fish fingers to salad creams and
breakfast cereals.

The concerns of Doerge and fellow FDA researcher
Daniel Sheehan focus on chemicals in soya known as
isoflavones which have effects similar to the female
hormone oestrogen.

While these chemicals may help to prevent a range of
conditions including high cholesterol, they also lead
to health problems in animals including altering
sexual development of foetuses and causing thyroid
disorders. Although soy is thought to protect against
breast cancer, some studies show that chemicals in
soya may increase the chances of breast cancer
which uses oestrogen-type hormones for growth.

Their letter to the FDA seen by The Observer states:
'There is abundant evidence that some of the
isoflavones found in soy demonstrate toxicity in
oestrogen sensitive tissues and in the thyroid.
Additionally, the adverse effects in humans occur
in several tissues.

'During pregnancy in humans, isoflavones per se
could be a risk factor for abnormal brain and
reproductive tract development.'

This will frighten mothers who increasingly use soya
milk for babies. Doerge said: 'They are exposing their
children to chemicals which we know have adverse
effects in animals. It's like doing a large uncontrolled
and unmonitored experiment on infants.'

The soya industry insists that most research shows
the health benefits of soya outweigh risks and that
adverse effects seen in animals do not apply to humans.

Richard Barnes, European director of the US Soy
Bean Association, said: 'Millions of people around the
world have been eating soya for years and have shown
no signs of abnormalities or disorders.'

I was not saying that my above list of ideas are good. But shurely every
public system can be traced. (Personal sharing between people that knows
each other can probably be keept secret. But that would be a rather small
problem for the IP industry.) If anonymous remailers are used, just make it
illegal to use anonymous remailers. If the law is stupid and brutal enough
piracy CAN be stopped. In a democracy we will shurely not want such
draconian laws, but that does not mean that they cannot be made or enforced.

That was the only point i tried to make.

    TWA FLIGHT 800 crash witnesses fed up with the official
    investigation formed the "TWA 800 Eyewitness Alliance,"
     which published a full-page ad in the Washington Times
     today demanding that the government tell the truth
     about the crash. In bold-face type they proclaim:

       "WE SAW TWA FLIGHT 800 SHOT DOWN BY MISSILES
           AND WE WON'T BE SILENCED ANY LONGER

   ... We, the eyewitnesses know that missiles were involved.
   We don't know who launched them, but we know that for some
   reason our government has lied and tried to discredit all
   of us to keep that question from being addressed. ... The
   claim that our evidence is worthless is false and we want
   to know who is behind it. Hundreds of us SAW what happened.
   The FBI, the CIA and the NTSB must not be allowed to get
   away with this cover-up by defamation of the eyewitnesses."

   =======================================================
   See Full Ad: http://TWA800.com/images/times-8-15-00.gif
   =======================================================

   IAN: It's funny how the media and assorted defenders of
   the official investigation tried to lead folks to believe
   that those of us who were trying to make witness accounts
   known were misrepresenting the accounts by our suggesting
   that the witnesses saw or even thought they saw a missile.
   Yet another defense of officialdom to the scrap heap.

   It was shortly after the crash, after I'd interviewed
   several witnesses that I realized there was something
   here. Each of these people who I contacted based on
   their names reported in the media was telling me about
   the same thing, about a rocket that rose from a low
   elevation fairly close to shore and that flew out to
   sea, headed south, trailing smoke in its path. That
   flight path was at 90 degrees to Flight 800's path,
   so it could not be Flight 800. The rocket ended in
   a small explosion -- the initial crash event. When
   I accumulated all witness accounts from which a line-
   of-sight could be established, I found that the rocket
   that they observed came from the same area, and the area
   was not the same as the crash. I then triangulated those
   accounts http://www.erols.com/igoddard/witness.gif . Even
   the accounts from which reliable line-of-sight could not
   be established were looking in the same general area. Not
   long thereafter retired Navy crash investigator Commander
   William Donaldson published his own triangulation of many
   more accounts than I had and his were based on interviews
   on location. His triangulated close-to-shore launch site
   is almost the same, one or two miles off my triangulation:
   http://twa800.com/images/triangulation_update.gif With the
   release of the NTSB report we discovered that the FBI had
   also triangulated missile-witness accounts and the FBI had
   triangulated accounts to virtually the same close-to-shore
   location both Donaldson and I independently determined:
   http://www.twa800.com/images/fbi_triangle.gif . These
   accounts are a human recording of what happened.

   About the study that found a positive correlation
   between tofu consumption and brain atrophy that I
   cover here http://www.erols.com/igoddard/soy.htm .
   There's an alternative theory about the cause of
   brain atrophy in that study, which if true would
   mean it's caused by contamination of some tofu,
   thus the cause wouldn't be attributable to soy:

What, you think there is actually a huge network of wires that is too
vast for people to eliminate all connections? There is a surprisingly
small number of cables connecting countries together, and even if you
don't shut them off physically, dos attacks against all servers in those
countries would not be difficult to set up either. Another thing to do
is to remove those countries top level domains from recognition on
servers and routers that have the most immediate connections to those
countries, so any traffic to and from then is simply denied.

Guaranteeing is not the issue, its enforcing against those it does catch
that is the issue. Your attitude is more of that bullshit 'if we can't
do it perfectly, we shouldn't do it at all.'

That is not what we are talking about, and you ought to know that.
People that write software like napster, which their main function is to
facilitate IP piracy, should be billed for all the royalties that the
users of that software are evading.

No, it's the Effusively Sarcastic list. Also known as the department of 
silly, caustic, sneeringly 'self satisfied at one's own humor' wit.

In its second major announcement in as many days, IBM announced on
Wednesday that it would invest $100 Million in genetics research.  This
follows Tuesday's announcement about the company's creation of a quantum
computer with five atom processor.  Get the story at:

Since there would be some variation in the mitochondrial DNA is there any 
possibility of an immune response against the foreign proteins in the 
mitochondria?  Cloning uses the process but the immune system develops with 
the organism.  Not so in the case of tissue engineering or organ replacement. 
 How much differentiation would be possible before such a response was 
elicited?  And, I know this is a little off the subject, but has anyone done 
any research into how we might be able to make a body accept foreign proteins 
(due to somatic cell engineering)?

Don't do it Eliezer! I'll grant you that a normal person in our culture with a name like
"Eliezer S. Yudkowsky" might be under a disadvantage, but you're not a normal person
and your ideas are not of the average sort, so you should have an unusual name, it's an
advantage. There once was a unsuccessful singer who had a mundane sounding name,
I forget what it was but it was almost as dull and forgettable as "John Clark", anyway he
changed it to "Engelbert Humperdink" and immediately became very successful.  I think
Arnold Schwarzeneger's name has helped him too.

Yes actually.  It's my understanding that the first units shipped in March
of '98, although I don't personally know of anyone who uses one.  But of
course, I don't happen to be in the broadcast business-- my world pretty
much revolves around the Avid.  Everything I've heard about the Trinity has
been generally positive... and hey, at the very least Play(tm) has a very
cool logo.

It may have IP provisions, maybe, but I doubt anybody pays any attention to them.
And as the USA is the most important member I doubt it has anything in it that would
violate the first amendment as this would. The second any attempt was made to actually
do something rather than just write a pretty treaty a USA court would shoot it down.

And is it even there?  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I've been unable to find
anything that supports your claim that "countries that refuse to accept WIPO rulings get
electronically embargoed". No country has ever been "electronically embargoed", not China,
not Cuba, not Iraq, not Iran, not North Korea, if information was restricted it was done from their
side not our side. I find it impossible to believe all countries would agree on such a ruling, even if
they did I find it impossible to believe all would agree on the interpretation of such a ruling,
even if they did I find it impossible to believe they'd be able to enforce it. All it would take is
for one other country to use a liberal interpretation of the word "restriction" and the floodgates
would be open.

Napster is a new way to distribute information, nothing more. I was just reading in

Contrary to a couple of other folks, Eliezer, I *do* think it's a good 
thing to choose your own name. However, I agree with John Clark (whose 
thinking stands out vastly more than his name!) that you don't want to pick 
something too ordinary just to be easy.

Take your time. Try out a few possibilities. It took me a year before I 
found a surname that I liked. (I already liked my first name, and so 
readopted it as part of my full name, while dropping a middle name that I 
had never used.)

Besides, think of all the cool people who have changed their names--Lenin, 
Stalin... uh, I'll stop now.

I agree with John, except on two points:  First, "John Clark"
is a solid name and one that conjures up a distinguished image.
 My father's name is John Clark and in his hay-day was an accomplished
art director in New York city.  Perhaps I'm a bit biased (:-),
but regardless, "Clark" is substantial, I think and it was my
one-word signature for many years.  Second, although I really
like Eli's name, he could reconfigure the letters in his name
to create one word, two, or three words that are striking and
memorable.

However, knowing Eliezer and the warm smile that illustrates
his face, by keeping his original name he could surprise those
who might expect a different sort of ideological baggage resorting
from his name's tradition.

I also think Arnold Schwarzenegger's name helped him.  (By the
way, Max and I saw him at the gym on Sunday and wow.)

FM Esfandiary changed his name and many couldn't make the connection
to FM-2030.  Esfandiary conjured up a West Asian tradition which
he wanted to shed, but which was pivital to much of his thinking
and which spurred his visionary ideas about the future.  It was
much of that region's dogma that he rebelled against which propelled
his passions.

   About the study that found a positive correlation
   between tofu consumption and brain atrophy that I
   cover here http://www.erols.com/IGoddard/Soy.htm .
   There's an alternative theory about the cause of
   brain atrophy in that study, which if true would
   mean it's caused by contamination of some tofu,
   thus the cause wouldn't be attributable to soy:

Ian,

Is soy getting black-balled because it's a threat to the dairy industry?
Who is paying for the soy research data?

Don't those milk mustache ads make you wonder: "What problem needs
addressing with that kind of $$$$$ damage control?" Is the 'mad cow'
(scrapies) virus present in milk?" Pasteurization does not destroy it.
(Yes, pasteurization temperatures were  increased.)

Convincing me that soy and tofu are less attractive food choices than dairy
will be a very hard sell - impossible really. I don't willingly consume
xenoestrogens or BGH.

Marketing campaigns based on scarey 'bs' data severely underestimate
consumer intelligence. Bs may work but insult will be taken to absolute
resistance.

Cerebral atrophy is related to compromised cerebral circulation, as in TIA.

PS: I didn't look at your websites - but I was already aware of the soy scare.

Don't forget Isaac Asimov.  He actually gave some thought to a anglicized

He attributed part of his success to his odd name.

Yeah, besides, anybody who is so stupid they can't pronounce your name right
probably isn't worth talking to, so it acts like a great filter that you don't
even need to think about...keeps the yutz's away from the Yuds...

Of course, going by a different nickname is ok. Ezer is good. What is your
middle name, anyways?

Actually, there is a theory on the soy brain atrophy which posits a causal 
link between one of soy's phytoestrogens (genestein (sp?) and adult 
neurogenesis (the recently discovered fact that adult mammals can indeed and 
do, grow new neurons). The genestein may inhibit adult neurogeneis, which is 
why, after many years of soy, you get a smaller brain than you would 
otherwise at that age.
That's why I won't eat soy.

It's good to be cynical of studies that are bought and paid for--after all, 
there are plenty of PhD's out of work. However, the study from Hawaii looked 
pretty good, and as a vegetarian I did not like having to read it. But there 
are plenty of other veggie protein sources--like whole grains--and they 
don't have all those phytoestrogens in them.

So its not that the greens have minds so open their brains fell out, but that
they never had much to start with? Reminds me of that Dilbert cartoon where Bob
the dinosaur pulls a hunk of earwax out of his ear and mistakes it for his
brain...

Well, If you really cared about the rights of other species, you would consider
that while milking a cow allows it to live on, harvesting soy for soymilk and
tofu is a great genocide of billions of organisms every year. It seems amazingly
cruel to tolerate such destruction simply because some elitists think its good
for their individual health.

The Controversial Colonel Corso in his book, "The Day After Roswell" has
one complete chapter on the prospect that the allegedly captured aliens
from Roswell were robots of a sort. I have to see that as something worth
considering but with a different spin. If the "products of measured
intelligence" can all be matched or exceeded by robots today using the
state-of-the-art technology (as I conclude in the Epilogue of "Machine
Psychology") then military intelligence cannot afford to ignore
this. Black Projects must be dealing with this in some way right now
because the prospect then exists of a robotic military intelligence centre
having robots working tirelessly 24 hours a day on advancing military
science and those robots are more intelligent than competing human
military scientists, as defined above. No military worth its salt can
afford to ignore the possibility of an enemy having such an installation.
Theoretically, Japan for example could race centuries past the US with a
hidden installation no bigger than a box car. And those "aliens" could
then be advanced robots from centres such as this.

I changed my surname when I got married, to my wife's name (quick primer for
newer arrivals; I'm a man).

Changing your name is a good experience. The funniest thing you note is
people reacting to you differently. I changed my surname from Evans to
O'Regan, and suddenly people (who hadn't known me before) were pointing out
all the Irish characteristics I possessed.

However, I would never change my name to something easier to spell, or
pronounce, or to anything more common. One of the best assets you can have
these days, in the massively crammed namespace of the net, is a weird name.

I've noticed it with my first name since I was a knee high to a grasshopper.
People remember me when I'm in a list of names; it means I get slightly more
personal treatment for no good reason. Job interviews are a particular case
in point; I introduce myself as Emlyn, and people say "ah yes, I remember
your application", because they notice the name. Another thing I like is
that people immediately assume I am going to be a bit eccentric, which is
lucky.

If someone has to ask you to spell your name, or makes the gaff of mistaking
you for the opposite gender, you've got it made. They will not forget you.

I've got a good friend, with a weird name; I've known him since our parents
lived in a group house together when I was 1 and he was just newly popped. I
lost him in the last year; we both move around a lot and don't talk that
often, different cities, so none of the contact details I had for him were
correct. I couldn't even find him in a phone book, because he's always in
group houses; never has the phone in his name.

I jumped onto ICQ the other day and looked him up. Only one person existed
in the world with that name; it was him. He told me he had lost my details
too; we might never have found each other again if not for that name.

My wife & I chose the name Lachlan for our new son (three months old now). I
didn't realise it was such a popular name! Luckily, I found the spelling
Lochlainn (which we have used instead), it's irish, matches the surname, and
will cause him hell with spelling it out to people forever. But, it'll stand
out. As soon as someone thinks "how do I pronounce this", they've thought
about you, and will remember you.

A good test of appropriate name weirdness: If you can find a name you've

I can't say much about the outrunning of embarrassing posts; I'm still busy
posting them. I wouldn't worry; people understand you change, and it
demonstrates that you learn. Fewer people do learn than one might think;
it's a good thing to be able to prove!

Much of life is about standing out from a crowd. Any edge you can get is a

I've been thinking of switching recently - either to my middle name, or
to something completely new, like "Ben Abard".  (Short, easy to spell,
and close to the beginning of the alphabet.)

Partially this is because my current name is so hard to pronounce.  But
the other reason is a harsh necessity for all children of the digital
age...

Yeah, I recently found an old junior high school friend online, just
because his name is unique- he never would have found me amongst all the
other "Doug Jones" entries.  In some circles I've used the name Random
or Randome, and that made me memorable.

I tried to name my son "Corwin" back in 1985 but his mother dug in her
heels and he's yet another Michael (five of the ten boys in his scout
patrol are Michaels! Arrrgh!)

You can guess from the names Random and Corwin that I like a certain
author.

Definitely, but note how well him name flows. It's unusual (which I find a 
good thing for anyone wanting to stand out), but it's also very cool 
sounding, is easy to say, and even sounds a bit science fiction-like.

If a 20-year old memory serves, another SF writer and skeptic, John Sladek 
wrote a series of parodies of SF writers, giving them each adjusted names. 
I still remember his robotic morph of Asimov's name: I Click As I Move.

Please. Not from 1947. If the japanese had that kind of technology in 1947 we
either wouldhave known about it at that point, or would have lost the war to
them. Alien encounters, so far as we can currently tell, are merely the product
of hypnogogic trances induced by chemical or electrical imbalances, as
Persinger's research with electric fields shows. If the level of alien
abductions are as high as proponents claim, there would be a fleet of at least
1000 such ufo's at a base on earth over the last 40 years, and at least one
crash every year. Such a fleet would require a resident population of a minimum
of 100,000 aliens to support with C3I, maintenance, and logistics support, and
this is also assuming that they don't have the same need for resources that we
do, that they do, in fact, have some sort of nanosanta technology. If they don't
have this then their logistical problems on increase from there.

Most of the alien BS you see is merely disinformation to cover for military R&D,
while some 'abduction' phenomena with material evidence may be evidence of
either government or corporate illegal experimentation on humans (since we know
the Energy Department has admitted to conducting such research for many years,
this is not out of the bounds of possiblity, not nearly as far as alien
abduction).

OK.  Here is an ASCII graphic to the rescue.   Let the X axis be the value
of a company's stock price P conditional on dumping the CEO, and let the Y
axis be the stock price conditional on not dumping the CEO.  The diagonal
line is where these two prices are equal.  Assume that everyone agrees that
the distribution over these outcomes is uniform within the marked region.

      |          /      The center of mass of this region is to the left of
      |       XX/XX     the diagonal, indicating that given this info it is
P if |    XXXX/XXX     better to not dump the CEO.  If, however, someone who
not  |  XXXXX/XX       knows where in this space the point is makes the
dump |XXXXXX/X         decision, then if the CEO is dumped that means that
CEO  |XXXXX/           the point is to the right of the line, and if the CEO
      |    /            is not dumped the point is to the left of the line.
      |   /             The center of mass of the right region is more toward
      |  /              right than the center of mass of the left region
      | /               is toward up.  Combining these coordinates gives a

Yes, my mother has often wished she had spelled my name as her swedish great
grandfather's name was spelled: Mikel. My father tells me that when he was in
the Army, he hung out with a lot of italian guys from Boston and New York, and
because he loved italian food so much (and his italian mother was such a good
cook) that the italian guys called him Norm Lorrelli.

However, I can't help but laugh at people who have plainly spelled names but try
to pronounce them oddly. For example, a girlfriend from high school was named
Andrea, no biggie. However she insisted that people pronounce it
'ahhhwn-dree-ah'.... boooring...

John, that comment was a proposal for how countries that support piracy should
be treated, so don't be fatuous. In fact, Iraq was electronically embargoed
during the Gulf War, as an example that this is not something new.

Any program can also have safeguards programmed into it that prevent illegal
uses. "Impossible" is not a word to an engineer or a programmer. You ought to
know that.

That's what I'm trying to elaborate on...that these phenomena, to the
extent that they are real, are military secret projects.
BTW is that URL below correct? I couldn't link to it.

Great books. Definitely good things to name yourself.
For my high school yearbook, I filled out the ID card as "Hogar, Prince of 
Chaos"
Unfortunately, the yearbook staff knew me, and filled in my "real" name. Grr.

There are at least three other Eliezer Yudkowskys floating around, that
I know of - simply within our family's Ever-Widening Circle of Relatives
- although fortunately, none of them have a net.presence *yet*.

"Abard" doesn't seem to be anyone's name at all... though abard.com is
taken, and there are still 258 hits on AllTheWeb... mostly misspellings
of 'aboard'.  If I did switch, I'd probably find something that didn't
show up on the search engines at all.

A good point about distinctiveness and euphony being as important as
uniqueness; I just think it should be possible to be distinctive, yet
easy to spell.

How about "Chester Q. Fordyce"?  Just kidding...

Doug Jones also has an interesting point about being able to steal from
Zelazny and the like.  I've never been good at coming up with syllables
myself.

You know?.....I've never thought of it like that.

My name is unusual too....it's intermediat...not overtly "first or
last"...that is it could be two last names...or back-assward
first/last....it's caused me no end of trouble....(Everitt Mickey).   In
fact once during high school I beleive there was a paperwork mix up and
during roll call in home room the teacher called out "Everitt"....(and I
answered "here") and a bit later called out "Mickey" ........(and I answered
"here")....this went on for some time....she was rather annoyed upon
discovering the truth.

I've always considere it a disadvantage though.  I appreciate the new
outlook.

I was just putting out some food for thought.  I was simply a little shocked at the idea of you changing your name.  It's a big decision and I wish you luck with it.  

I agree with others that an unusual name can have a strength, catchiness and charm that a "mundane" name just won't have.  Again, it is your choice.  I thought Max, Natasha and John gave good counsel on the matter.

I do feel changing a subject line can be good now and than.  So often the subject lines stay the same while the actual topic veers all over the place! lol  I realize many people like subject lines to stay the same for the sake of sorting things for their files.

best of luck to you,

John

Yeah, well, you can always make up a weird name for use on the net but that
doesn't mean you have to wear it everywhere you go.  I got awfully tired of
spelling my name ALL the time. And people always seem to remember me no
matter what I tell them my name is (this could be a really bad thing if I
were into crime). I'd be willing to bet people remember Eliezer too,
although I've never met him in person.  Sometimes less distinctiveness is in
order rather than more.

Mmm... Zelazny... I miss him muchly.


I also changed my name, albeit in a fairly minor way.  When I first started
out as an actor, I discovered there was already a Jason Thompson registered.
I wasn't really fond of the idea of changing the spelling, (Jaysen
Thompson?!  Ugh.) so I stole my brother's first name and made it a middle
name.


Oh yeah, and for the record, my original middle names were Ruben and Elroy.
(Those crazy Canadians and their double middle names.)

Although, I was always sort of fond of Elroy... at the very least it let me
sign my initials as JET on all those damn arcade games I played as a kid.

I am not sure I disagree with your premise, however, I see the response to 
Kosovo really being a too little, too late, for Bosnia in 1992 where genocide 
was undertaken by the Milosevic government and security forces. That was the 
time to darken Belgrade with hig explosives. Our effort should have been 
(then) to depose the Chetnik government. I am a big fan of Low Intensity 
Warfare, or High Intensity-short duration warfare. Why? Because its costs 
less lives and has the chance of removing dictatorships that cause mass 
murder. These are no absolutes, and the morality is questionable; but so is 
being a by-stander while the Gulag churns out corpses.

Why bother changing your name unless your goal is to create confusion...
If your goal is to show that you aren't the same person anymore, then
just add a version number: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky 2.0 or somesuch.

What about Max Power?  The name has a kind of ring to it.

Doh!

Or Illuminatus Maximus (that one is already taken, though, so tough luck)
;-P

What about John Steel -- sounds rather manly, doesn't it? Isn't there some 
actor named like that (B/C action flicks, I presume).

It occurs to me that know one has considered to ask what the name Ben Abard 
means to you, E. 

Pray tell, is it like "A Bard" as in Shakespeare? 

I think changing one's name is terribly Extropic, and I encourage you, in 
light of recently breaking from your restrictive religious bounds, to explore 
your own names and identity!

The Internet is akin to the wild frontieer.  Current laws have very little
teeth in the online world-- something that's leading to increasing concern
over issues such as invasion of privacy and online stalking.

If Internet time was  a little bit slower, I expect that you would see a
natural evolution of structure-- more mom's and kids moving out to the wild
west, more need for stability, more law makers,  etc.

As it stands however, the cowboys are running the salon, and they've got the
biggest guns.

As I've indicated before, my preferred solution is a technological one.  But
I -am- in favor of social engineering to get us where we want to go.  So,
what do we do?

Firstly, if we decide that something is against the law, we should be
prepared to enforce that law.  People are taking a lot of things for granted
right now and they aren't going to be exactly happy to give up their free
toys.  Nonetheless, the government can't wuss out.  This requires an
educated, involved, technological government body-- and I think its pretty
clear to most people that we don't exactly have that just yet.  Some simple,
educated commitment to protecting individual rights online would send a very
strong signal.  People need to recognize that a significant portion of our
existence is making a move into a virtual realm and we need to be prepared
to bring significant structure to our new modality.

Of course the cowboys don't want to play nice-- they have all the power in
the current model.  Unfortunately it seems hard to illuminate those
individuals to the larger perspective-- if we bring stability to this world,
a real civilization can start to form.

Alright, I don't have any pat answers, but I can suggest directions that we
should be moving towards:

a) Increased Education.  We've been pirating stuff for so long, we've
forgotten its against the law.  Remind people that some of us make a living
with our brains.  Remind people that IP is valuable... and getting more so.

b) Involved Government.  The law makers need to get online and get wired.
This is the new world and it's no longer good enough to just have good
people skills and an understanding of bridge tolls and urban violence.

c) Legitimate Access.  I absolutely agree that the RIAA should have bought
Napster-- what were they thinking?  A widely available means to legimately
access content is desperately needed-- and as a directly commercial venture
it should be able to offer better, more reliable, more legitimate service
than anyone else.

d) No wimps in Law Enforcement.  The laws need teeth, and if you're going to
call it illegal, then do something about it.

and

e) Technology.  To my mind, it's clear that there are huge benefits for
people to be more closely integrated with their information.  Those benefits
need to be demonstrated and distributed.   New technologies should focus on
personal power-- less about how thousand of college kids can get free music,
more about how you as an individual can make your own music.  Technologies
that make it easy and profitable for people to be contributory, not easy and
profitable to leech.  Superior encryption should be widely available.
Individuals should be able to participate in totally private, secure
communication and transactions.  We need smart information: data that knows
stuff about itself, data that follows rules.

Thanks for clarifying that for me, after all it was the emulation of past posts

The debate in this article, "Intelligence in the Cosmos: Flesh or
Machine?" seems misguided.  The distinction between machine and biology
will not necessarily remain meaningful in the future.  Biology can be
engineered and improved until it would be unrecognizable to a biologist
today.

When we meet an alien which is a product of a mature technology, his
physical form will be entirely due to choice, to the constraints imposed
by natural law and by his own desires.  Asking whether this form is
biological or mechanical is meaningless.

I was also disappointed, as I often am, by the primitive thinking
exhibited by people who are supposedly experts in the field.  Benjamin
Zuckerman, a UCLA professor who edited a book on ETI, pronounces himself
surprised by the notion that aliens could be monitoring us invisibly
via nanotech.  Come on, we've talked about that notion dozens of times
over the years.  It's so obvious that anyone with a basic awareness of
the issues will think of it!  And yet this Zuckerman sticks with his Star
Trek view of the universe.  Our debates on these issues are apparently
far more advanced and sophisticated than what passes for discourse in
the old-style academic world.

Hmm... no idea why you can't get to the MSNBC page, it
loads just fine when I go there... Here's another site
with the article (exact same text, just different
pictures; actually, this was the original, and the
MSNBC one just a reposting of the same article):

Maybe that one will work for you.

I was going to comment on all of your stuff, but most of your post is laying
out a position I would disagree with in one paragraph, then refuting it in
the next paragraph.  So, we are in general agreement, which is something to
be frightened of.  I don't recall any previous time on this list someone has
agreed with me for such a long stretch.

As for Kant, I'm not the only person under Objectivist influence who does
not agree with Rand's unrelenting bashing of him.  See, e.g., George Walsh's
"Ayn Rand and the Metaphysics of Kant" at
http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/objectivity/walsh1/walsh.html  (For
the record, I don't agree with all he has to say here.  I won't go over that
here.  Just wanted to point out that I'm far from being alone.)

Cheers!

A Poison Tree

I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears;
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine.
And he knew that it was mine,

And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
                    -- William Blake (1757-1827)

Hallucinations of 'aliens', i.e. the bug eyed greys, are what is known
in psychology as archetypal characters, much like the figure in Munsch's
_The Scream_, they  are part of our subconcious, and are thought by some
to be related to PTSD supressed memories of medical treatments at birth
or in infancy, when one's visual cortex is not fully developed, so
visual memories are rarely clear. Then there is another archetype, known
as the Watcher, which is a part of our psyche (I beleive its the
superego) that 'watches over us' in our dreams, and many people in dream
research report seeing The Watcher frequently.

The tentative identification of the 'alien' archetypes as actual
extraterrestrials by experiencers is only a modern association. In prior
eras they were thought to be demons, or fairies, or elves, or other
mythical eldritch folk. The fact that such experiences can be reproduced
in the laboratory by researchers like Persinger on subjects without any
'real' alien experience indicates that this phenomena is completely in
the mind. 

The existence of this phenomena is used by psychologists in the employ
of government agencies to promote disinformation as second level cover
stories for secret projects (first level being official denial). That so
many people have such experiences helps to convince large percentages of
the population to beleive strongly in the reality of 'aliens' and
'abductions' and 'ufos at Area 51', with the rest of the population
convinced that those that do beleive are kooks. What is really happening
at military research bases has little to do with the experiences of
'witnesses', they are merely convenient pawns in the real game of
spy/counterspy. How many KGB agents will get promoted wasting resources
try to spy on UFOs? None.

I'm a big critic of warfare in general, though I do allow for exceptions.
I'm not against anyone volunteering to go over there and fight as a private
soldier.  I think the US government should stay out of it.

The easiest way to remove a dictator: one bullet right through the brain.
That doesn't take a massed army.  It doesn't take a concerted alliance
against him or her.  Just one bullet from one gun.  Game over.

Fatuous? China supports piracy, it hasn't been embargoed and never will be.

Baloney. Millions watched  the war on live TV from Baghdad as that city was being

How will a program know if a sequence of ones and zeros is copyrighted? Would you

used in many legal ways? Who exactly would NOT be in jail?

I'll tell you one thing, a programmer wishing to overcome those safeguards certainly
wouldn't use the word "Impossible".

Freedom in the face of the advance of technology is a tricky subject.

I had a thought on it today.  Every person here, even the transparent
society fans, have a debt to John the Revelator.  His notion of a mark
of the beast, etc, has caused our society to have a kind of embedded
fear of big brother.  This has caused us to take a most cautious
approach
to the advance of transparency.  

Nowthen, transparency is coming, of course, there is no stopping it, 
and many of us do not want to.  But it is a good idea that it advances 
slowly enough that we may have time to think out every step and 
compensate down the influence of government as transparency increases.  
We have time to recognize, for instance, that with increasing
transparency, 
the libertarian party has a chance to actually get one of ours elected 
for a change.  spike

THE CROSS AND THE PLUMBLINE - by Crichton Miller

Dear List Members

Chris Ogilvie-Herald has kindly allowed me space in his respected 
news list, EGYPTNEWS, to share with you, what may become one of the 
most enlightening discoveries. A key to both the past and the future 
understanding of our distant ancestors. 

I am a Scottish born researcher and Company Director with an interest 
in prehistory. I have applied for a patent on a derivative of the 
Celtic cross.

This application was published on the 14th of June 2000 under UK 
patent application GB 2 344 654 A

Despite intensive research by The Patent Office prior to publication, 
no instrument with its complete attributes has been discovered and 
its application was not found to be obvious.

The Celtic cross, which is an ancient and sacred symbol, with which 
most people are familiar, appears to be a representation of an 
ancient instrument that was used by our ancestors as far back as 
Neolithic times.

I believe that it was what the Ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians used 
to survey their buildings and navigate the oceans of the world.
Despite the discovery of cocaine in some of the Egyptian Mummies, it 
has been argued, in august and academic circles, that it was 
impossible for them or the Phoenicians to have crossed the Atlantic 
in prehistory, because of their inability to navigate.
Thor Heyderhal scotched the concept that their boats were incapable 
with his Ra expedition.

I am about to collapse the final argument, by proving that they could 
navigate and had the instrument to do it. 

The discovery came about in the winter of 1997 when I was trying to 
figure out what the Ancient Egyptians would have used to survey the 
great pyramid complex at Giza.

All constructions, even ancient ones, require surveying before 
commencement of work.

The incredible pyramid of Cheops and the Giza complex, which seems to 
embody the mathematical value of PI, would have to be accurately 
surveyed, as would all similar constructions, including stone circles 
such as Stonehenge, Avebury and Callanish in Scotland. Callanish is 
more than 5000 years old and built in the form of a Celtic cross. 
Proof that this knowledge predates the Egyptian Pyramids.

Through intensive and exhaustive experimentation, a belief in the 
intelligence of our ancestors and a refusal to believe in little 
green men as the designers, I discovered that the only appropriate 
instrument that could have been used by the architect, in the place 
of a theodolite, was a derivative of the cross, with the addition of 
a plumbline. This incredibly simple, yet complex instrument, has the 
potential to measure angles and inclinations to an accuracy of 1 
minute of arc or 1/60th of a degree, depending on the size of the 
instrument used. This is an extraordinary accuracy for what appears 
to be only two pieces of wood, a scale and a plumbline. One of the 
most interesting but obscure abilities of the Cross is its capability 
to take sidereal measurements.

With my experience of navigation as a qualified Yachtmaster, I turned 
my experimentation to discover if the ancient mariners could find 
latitude and longitude with the cross. The experiments conducted, 
confirmed that the ancients could find their position anywhere on the 
Earth within 3 nautical miles with a hand held device. This discovery 
may help to prove that it was possible for sailors such as the 
Phoenicians to have made regular trading contact with the Americas in 
pre Columbian times.  It also may explain the mysterious navigation 
skills of the Polynesians. This discovery also helps support pioneers 
of the theory of ancient intercontinental travel such as Thor 
Heyderhal with his Kon Tiki and Ra expeditions.

I then went on to discover that this instrument was probably the 
basis of geometry, mathematics, ancient astronomy, map making and 
time keeping.

That this instrument was used in combination with a detailed 
knowledge of astronomy and monthly star positions, ecliptic and 
zodiac observations so as to locate the position of any star at any 
time over a location on the earth's surface. Hence the saying "as in 
heaven so on earth"

Furthermore, those observers were placed at strategic observatories 
throughout the known world to keep local time and traditions and to 
aid mariners and other travelers.

Those travelers were able to find their longitude over short 
distances with the use of sand (hour) glasses in relation to local 
time between observatories (stone or wood henges in the north and 
pyramids in the lower latitudes) and world time kept at the old 0 
degree meridian at Giza.

I also believe that the henges were used to keep time and in fact 
were large astrolabes where stone balls were moved around the henge 
on a daily basis to represent the positions of the planets in 
relation to the sun and zodiac throughout the year.

That Ley (lay) lines, an ancient and modern navigation term, were 
used to lay the position line, or course, of one place in relation to 
another. This term is misconstrued to have magical or magnetic 
properties by modern cultists. It is in fact related to astro 
navigation and can be found in modern navigation manuals. The lay 
line from the Cape Verde Islands to the Caribbean Antilles, avoiding 
the Sargasso Sea is exactly 17 degrees North.

To find this line an instrument that measures the declination of a 
star or the sun at azimuth would have to be used. I believe that this 
instrument was the Cross with a plumbline.

I also believe that the quadrant, used in the 13th century was an 
inferior instrument in that it was incapable of sidereal measurements.

I further believe that the Cross and the methods of its use, is one 
of the greatest treasures found by the famous Knights Templar, in 
their excavation of Solomon's Temple, during the Crusades.
That this discovery led to a new style of architecture and the 
building of the Great Cathedrals in Europe, starting with Chartres in 
France.

It may also have led to the greatest untold confidence trick in the 
last millennium played on Spain by Christopher Columbus and 
eventually leading to the destruction of the Amerindian civilizations.
There is evidence that the Templars, to whom Columbus was associated, 
had been voyaging to the Americas for two hundred years before the 
official discovery. Using the cross as a navigation instrument. The 
Templar Archivist has already argued at Roslyn Chapel in Scotland, 
that William St Claire had voyaged to America before Columbus.
The fact that the instrument actually works and can be demonstrated 
to fulfil a universal role in many functions, is vindication of my 
theories.

What is truly amazing, is that no one has discovered this lost 
knowledge in modern times.

The message in stone, wood, metals and art has been around for 
thousands of years, in full view of the public.

Apart from the publication of the patent, I have been asked to 
publish and had accepted an academic 20,000-word paper, with 38 
technical illustrations in the November 2000 issue of Fortean 
Studies. This article will be of great interest to those studying 
Egyptian constructions, but unfortunately can not be revealed until 
after publication comes out. In this paper I have outlined the 
methods used to tell the time and navigate with the combination of 
the cross, pyramids, stone circles and henges.

I have also been asked to appear at the next Fortean Unconvention in 
London to speak about my discoveries.

I have accepted that my name be put forward.

I have appeared for 15 minutes in May 1999 on Teidi Television, 
following a lecture he gave to a conference on Mayan Culture in 
Tenerife. After gifting a working model of the Cross to Don 
Ajlehandro. Head Elder of forty-five Elders and spiritual leader of 
6,000,000 Maya people. The only person allowed by the authorities to 
conduct ancient ceremonies on the Yucatan Pyramids. The last ceremony 
held at that time had in attendance every Amerindian Tribal Chief 
from Tierra del Feugo to Alaska.

Don Ajlehandro said that it was his people's lost "Staff of Power" 
used to design pyramids and lost when the Conquistadors dispossessed 
them 500 years ago. He promised to show it to his Elders and place it 
for instruction of the young in the Maya Mystery Schools.
A small article has been purchased by Practical Boatowner magazine 
and is due for publication showing how the instrument can be easily 
used as an emergency navigation backup in case of electronic 
navigation system failures.

Apart from being a help to Archaeologists, in piecing together the 
unexplained mysteries and purposes of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, 
Peru, Stonehenge and other ancient constructions, I hope that my 
discovery will be an enlightenment to all seekers after the truth.
That this discovery will enlighten all people about our past and 
inspire other researchers, helping to further our knowledge and 
understand the obscure culture of the ancients.

I hope that I can find further sponsorship and assistance in 
providing the instrument to developing countries for a cheap and 
efficient method of surveying projects such as construction, road 
building and irrigation.

I also hope, that this instrument may be used in the practical 
education of the young, so that they may gain a basic and interesting 
foundation of this ancient knowledge.
T
hat they may learn how our ancestors survived and learnt about 
astronomy, navigation, construction, mathematics, geometry and time 
keeping.

How they went on to apply this knowledge, which is lost in the mists 
of time, to construct the ancient wonders of the world and achieve 
the seemingly impossible.

I am presently compiling my research, with the aim of completing my 
first book by the spring of 2001.

The recommended site was enormously informative, Zero, and
I thank you.

Greg -- I share your fascination although I don't perceive it as
morbid. I've no interest whatever in other types of transport
disaster, or in generic disaster scenarios of any kind. It's true
that "nuts" tend to have "morbid" interests, but I would describe
myself as "an unreconstructed aerospace fanatic" so that my
attention, while socially borderline, is otherwise asymptomatic.
Seriously -- how do you interpret this specific interest?

And while I've got you on the line, Greg, please appreciate that
I DO regard serotonin reuptake neuropathy as correlated with
suicide, or an apathy sufficiently profound to justify a diagnosis
of "quasi-neonatal failure to thrive" You see, we really have no
category for this illness [c.f. involutional melancholia] and I
regard the word "depression" as a metaphor rather than a
satisfactory diagnostic category, supposing that phrases such
as "neurochemically induced mood disorder" [in endogenetic
cases] not only more accurate, but less prejudicial. One may
consider this disorder as analogous to diabetes, either of
which may or may not contribute to the death of an otherwise
viable person.

I think Concorde can in some way be compared to the SR-71.  Two unique
highspeed aircraft that will never be replaced, each have millions wanting
or wanted them scraped, each are an excellent demonstration of what brains
can achieve when you want them to!

As Kelly Johnson once said (wearing a very dodgy plaid jacket!) "It'll be a
long long time before they make another airplane that goes faster and higher
then the SR-71"  He said that in the 70s and its still true!!!!

-------------------

Provided we have enough brain-power and sufficient resources we can accomplish
almost anything we set our minds to. If we wanted to we could develop a quiet 
and economical SST to replace the Concorde and possibly many subsonic 
transports. However, it is not in the industry's interest to do so, especially 
given the huge investment they would have to make which would be considered very 
risky and thus unprofitable. This aversion to risk has already been devastating
in some respects. Our inability or unwilingness to innovate will come back to 
haunt us some day.

Actually I've read many businesspeople coming from Europe take the Concorde
over (arriving in US around same time of day that they left), do their
biz here, and then grab a normal slower flight back to sleep on. In that
case I can see that it makes sense.

       AMERICAS X-PLANES

       By Christopher Hess

       No other aircraft program illustrates the USA's strong will for the
       leadership in aerospace technology better than the X-Planes. In more
       than 50 years since the first supersonic flight of the Bell X-1, the X
       designation aircraft have become the technological spearhead in
       developing new aircraft and spacecraft.
       Including a few classified projects there are currently 12 active or
       planned X programms which will fly in the medium term. However,
       this number includes single projects, such as Boeing's or Lockheed
       Martin's Joint Strike Fighter prototypes (X-32 and X-35) which are
       not X-Planes in the classical sense of technology driven experimental
       vehicles.
       The X programm was initiated at the end of the Second World War as
       a joint effort from NASA (back then NACA, National Advisory
       Committee for Aeronautics) and the US forces. The goal of the
       project was the exploration of the back then still unexplored speed
       region of high subsonic (transsonic) and low supersonic.
       When Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier on 14 October 1947,
       such accomplishing the near-term program goals, the flight
       experiments did not stop but were intensified. Most interestingly the
       original XS aircraft designation (for eXperimental Supersonic) was
       changed into X already at the very beginning of the program.
       The continous research of supersonic flight gave the Americans an
       immense Knowledge about the flight in the high-speed region,
       cumulating in the X-15 that reached a speed of more than six times the
       speed of sound and an altitude of more than 100 km.
       This high-speed research was only the beginning. In the past 50 years,
       the most different aircraft configurations were tested under the X
       designation. The spectrum reaches from a tailsitting vertical lift-off
       plane via a nuclear powered bomber and a gyro copter to the
       spaceplane of the future. Engines used in the projects include jet,
       propeller and rocket motors.
       Today, the role of the X-planes has changed significantly. While at
       the beginning their purpose was mainly to give the US a technological
       lead (especially in the military aircraft sector), today's experimental
       aircraft must have a commercial perspective as far as the potential
       application of the tested technology is concerned. There is an obvious
       shift from aviation to spaceflight in the research activities.
       The USA see a big market potential in spaceflight. But in order to
       exploit that market, the cost of transportation must be reduced
       considerably. However, the necessary technologies are not yet or
       only little tested. Here, the industry needs support to take the
       technological risk. This is the part the X-Planes must play today.
       NASA has developed the Future-X concept in the frame of its Space
       Transportation Program. According to this concept, new technologies
       are tested with demonstrator vehicles in two classes. First the
       pathfinder class vehicles which are focus on a very narrow
       technology. Accordingly, these demonstrators are designed for a very
       short development time of less than two years from program start to
       flight tests. Also, the program costs should be less than 100 million
       Dollars.
       One example for such a pathfinder technology demonstrator is the
       X-34 which is currently undergoing integration tests with its
       Lockheed TriStar launch aircraft at NASA's Dryden Flight Research
       Center. The X-34 is supposed to start suborbital flights next year,
       reaching Mach 8. The technologies to be demonstrated include an
       autonomous flight control and landing system, as well as, an
       integrated health monitoring system that is supposed to allow quick
       turnarounds between flights.
       While the pathfinders are focusing on specific technologies, larger
       vehicles, the so called trailblazers, will be used to validate the
       integration of various technologies and systems. These experimental
       demonstrators almost look like the real vehicles. For example, the
       X-33 is a half-scale VentureStar which Lockheed projects as one
       possible successor of the Space Shuttle. The X-33 already features
       several design components of the VentureStar, such as new
       Aerospike rocket engines and a metal thermal protection system.
       With this approach, NASA together with the industry is making its
       way towards the next generation of new space transportation systems.
       This also includes cost-sharing aspects of industry and government.
       Meanwhile, Europe has recognized the new X-attitude of the USA.
       With its Future Launchers Technologies Programme, which includes
       small and large technology demonstrators, the European Space
       Agency wants to create a technological basis for a competitive and at
       least partially reusable space transporter.

A few reasons come to mind.  The intake has access to less turbulent
air {and so higher pressure} if they are below the wing, and secondly
having the engines above the wing would raise the center of gravity, which
is bad for stability.  Further, if the center of thrust were above the center
of pressure, then getting on the gas would push the nose down instead
of up.  The way it is, a pilot can control the aircraft in a hydraulics-out
sitch to a certain extent as was demonstrated by the pilot in the Sioux City
crash a few years ago.

The high mounted engines would still be vulnerable to exploding tires,
perhaps less so.  Rubber frags would be thrown forward and ingested by
the screaming engines on takeoff.
spike

-------------------

My question is this:

Repeated news reports talk about the Concorde having difficulties
with tires exploding on landing gear.

Military aircraft, the SR-71 in particular are considerably smaller
than the Concorde but travel in similar regimes.

So why would the Concorde have tire difficulty and you never hear
about tire problems on other supersonic aircraft.  Yes, they are
smaller but you get the idea.  Since the Concorde is a civilian 
airliner perhaps it's more noted.  Most military craft don't 
report to the media that there were issues.

The news this morning discussed a "cow catcher" on the landing 
gear coming loose, puncturing the fuel tank thus causing a leak
and thus the fire..  Big ouch but it also appears that the British
saw an issue with this and devices a leash to keep the catcher 
affixed to the landing gear in the event it did come loose, a novel
idea but one the french evidently didn't adopt.

I read Dan Zinngrabe's excellent article on Brilliant Buzzard on 
his old website and it talked about very large aircraft having 
landing gear requirements where manufacturers didn't want to have
to re-invent the wheel if they didn't have to, thus re-using
landing gear designs for other aircraft.   

I'm curious if indeed the Concorde used an existing design or
if it was unique to that aircraft.  Might be an interesting read
even though it's off-topic.  

Thoughts?

-------------------

You cannot compare military and civilian aircraft like that.
As I understand it, the Concorde's flaw has to do with the placement of the 
landing gear in front of the engines. In the event a tire explodes, debris from 
the explosion will end up puncturing the skin and or being ingested by the 
engines, causing FOD (foreign object damage) and possibly disabling one or more 
engines, which is what apparently happened in this case.

In the SR-71's case the engine intakes are far away from the landing gear and 
the gear is aft of the engines anyway (the engines are rooted in the wings).

In most military aircraft the landing gear is well aft of the engine intakes or 
is placed far enough to the port or starboard of the intakes so that it does not 
pose a risk to the engines or any critical parts of the airframe.

Yes, it is quite possible.

It is common practice to re-use existing landing gear assemblies on new designs.
However this does not necessarily impact the placement of those assemblies on 
the airframe (placement is usually impacted by other factors such as 
load-factors and balance and center of gravity issues).

I don't know if they used an existing design or whether they designed one from 
scratch, although I suspect they may have done so, since the Concorde "probably" 
had rather unique requirements.

Sam

------------------

I couldn't tell from the video or front shot with at 
least 1 engine on fire where the main landing gear was
in relation to the nacelle's inlets.  It did seem like
they "about even" with each other so if an engine blew
some pieces out some might hit the tires.  I believe it
is more likely that tire blowouts would have an
unfortunately good chance of being ingested by the
innermost engine or both.

Also I didn't know that the Concorde takes off at
250mph!!!  That's pretty damn fast!  I believe the
SR-71's usually rotated near 150 mph and got airborne
before reaching 200 mph.  It's tires are pretty tough
but someone mentioned that new tires are put on after
10 flights...or sooner if major wear "flat spots" are
discovered.  I have read that if one SR-71 main tires
fails, the other 2 will fail also because the loads
are too high for just 2 tires.  And usually the plane
just grinds down the wheels and starts on the struts
next!!  I believe these tires, which are very expensive,
are rated for a maximum of 249 mph.

Perhaps not or maybe only in local newspapers.  I get
most of my info from various books and info that is
posted here.  I don't remember reading much about tire
failure on the Concordes before the recent crash but
I recall tv reports and articles about a Concorde that
lost a major portion of the tailfin/rudder.  I thought
that was attributed to the crew trying to set a speed
record..
> >
..snip...

---------------------

   It's also worthy of note that the Concordes have a shield on the gear that 
is used to keep spray from being ingested.  The British experienced a problem 
with the original design shredding and flying up and impacting the fuel tanks 
and other areas.  They modified all of their Concordes and the problem has not 
reoccurred.  Although they had the same data, the French chose not to perform 
the modification on their Concordes.  Parts of the shield, as well as tires 
were found on the runway...

Mine too.  Even my modern standards it is a very comfortable aircraft
for the long haul.  If you want an interesting discussion of the L1011
vs its real competitor the Douglas DC 10, Ben Rich discusses it in his
book Skunk Works.  The DC10 had the straight thru tail engine, which
forced the rudder to be shorter, which required the wing engines to
be closer inboard so that in a one-engine-out condition, the shorter
rudder could overcome the resultant yaw.  The L1011 had the more
expensive and complicated (Lockheed loves to do things this way
whenever possible) S-shaped thrust duct, allowing a longer rudder,
allowing the wing engines to be further outboard, so the passenger
compartment is quieter.  The company calculated it would need to
sell 250 of the 1011s to break even, and it sold 246 if memory
serves correctly.  spike

Seems to me that the *only* one of these suggestions which would have a 
chance of succeeding, is more stringent law enforcement.  Nobody has 
"forgotten" that its illegal to pirate data.  Its just that nobody gets 
busted for it, so nobody is scared to do it.  If there were repeated, 
numerous and notorious piracy busts people would think twice before 
Napstering data.  *That* would work.  But think of what that would mean...

Eliezer S. Yudkowski name change? I appreciate the need for self, 
re-invention (as all good Uberminds will practice). But the name change 
thingy seems more like a fleeing the past, rather then aquiring a future. I 
wonder if the person formerly known as E.S. Yudkowski's life was so 
discordent, that he would need to submerge his history, entirely?  I wonder 
what section of Ortho are they, Hasid or Mitnagdim? Mr. Ben Abard will surely 
know.

hideousness, the Croat-Utashi government did not draw first blood, or 
threaten that it would. That was the Chetniks under Milosovich, who started 
off the camps and "ethnic cleansing". Once fighting began, anything can be 
possible.

As far as involvement in the process-I am just another ass-sitter who lived

During the Commonwealth days in seventeenth century Britain there was a

was known as Damned Barebones. Now that's a distinctive name, but uuuuugly!

  IAN: Lon White's study is a subset of a longitudinal
  heart study conducted by the Honolulu Heart Program
  that was "established in 1965 for research on heart
  disease and stroke. Questions regarding frequency of
  consumption of tofu and 26 other foods were asked at
  interviews in 1965-67 and again in 1971-74." [*] Dr
  White et al, published several papers on the data set
  acquired from that study not at all related to tofu,
  and that data is available to be retested. Dr White's
  study from that same data set on Alzheimer rates of
  Japanese American's versus Japanese is seen cited
  in various Alzheimer-research papers. That study
  of White's was published in the Journal of
  the American Medical Association:

White, L.,  Petrovich, H., Ross, G. W., Masaki, K. H.,
Abbot RD, et al. (1996) Prevalence of dementia in older
Japanese-American men in Hawaii. JAMA, 276, 955-960.

  I believe White's study is not an anti-soy hit.

Hey, don't be so pessimistic.  I wouldn't count technology out.

Also, you don't think that pervasive legitimate cheap access to IP isn't

It sounds like the name of a demon summoned from the depths of hell!  How would you bind and control such a creature?  I suppose a combination of excellent financial incentives, binding legal contracts, intellectual stimulation.... and knowing his REAL name.

There's that plural again!  I must be missing something.  Are you a member
of the government?  Where did you affect the decision-making process?  Did
Tony Blair or Bill Clinton consult with you before they decided to give
authorization to bomb?  Or perhaps you flew missions over Belgrade?

As for me, I was a critic of the war, before, during, and after the war.
(See below.)

Okay.  Hey, everyone!  Look who's not a fan of the Ustasha!  Done.  Max
Power gets things done.

True.  Franjo Tudjman's died recently.  I.e., he lived a long and bloody
life.  His party only lost power a few months ago.  The Mesic-Racan
government seems much better and likely to reform in the direction away from
nationalist authoritarianism.  Of course, the deed is done, so some might
argue that Tudjman's group completed their mission.

> For all their past

> threaten that it would.

That depends on when you start looking.  If you look in 1941, the Ustasha
wins hands down.  If you look in the 1990s, surely, it's hard to say.  But
even if they did not, killing innocents is wrong period, no matter who's
doing it or when.

The process was a little different.  I think, basically, all sides wanted
regions wherein their ethnic group was a sizeable majority and no threat
existed to its power.  (The same process, sadly, seems to be taken place in
Ethiopia and Eritria right now, though, of course, no one is suggesting NATO
get involved.)  Or, more likely, the leaders used ethnicity to stay in or
expand their power with this kind of logic.  My point was merely Croatia
gets a free pass here (as does just about every other nation state that
plays the ethnic cleansing game), by the U.S. State Department and by
Michael Lorrey.

In some cases, e.g., Indonesia, it would not even be a matter of going in
and fighting against that government, but just of cutting of military aid.
President Clinton had a chance to do that before the massacres in East
Timor.  He did not and notably few people were vocal on this.

It's no one's responsibility to save the planet.  That said, if you feel the
urge, do so, but leave those who just want to work on their small
neighborhood alone.  Don't think you have the moral high ground because you
want to save some strangers half a world away, regardless of whether it will
work.  (Results are very important.  Here, we have lots of dead people and a
region in shambles.  IMHO, the Kosovar Albanians were better before the war
than now, especially the ones who are now dead.  Same for me.  I wouldn't
want someone rescuing me by getting me killed.)

And I thought this list was full of libertarians, not war loving hawks!:)

Later!

Why the lack of ambition? The scientologists & rabid Christian cultists seem
to be able to put together
TV channels and big recruitment drives .... if you think that "radical
futurism" can be covered in an hour-long doc and repeated ... then there
can't be very much to your mental universe.

Extropianism can be dismissed in similar throw-away terms (robotic sci-fi
fantasists &c) ... but the facts are that there is a *synergy* between the
interests of techno-pagans, nu-agers and extropians ... all of which groups
want progress away from failing aspects of the inert shopping-channel
mainstream.

"Posthumans" were mentioned by Blavatsky in the Secret Doctrine in the
1800's, and surely no  Extropian or trans-human can disagree with the
Victorian adept McGegor Mather's advice that we try to be "more than human."

"Tree-hugging" environmentalists tend to be scientists ... surely none of us
argues for the destruction of Earth?
Global warming seems to have something to do with the recent forest fires in
the States, Alex, or are you pleased to see the destruction of all these
trees?

Response to the Extropian & Nu-Age TV/ Radio have been quite good (I see
them as two separate things from a programming perspective, but maybe
sharing infrastructure & advertising &c).

Actually, Steve, the recent forest fires in the western US are a direct
consequence of environmentalists anti-logging politics of the last 15 years. I
was over the 4th of July in the Bitterroot forest, where one of the major blazes
is located. I have NEVER seen so much dead wood accumulated on the ground,
nicely dried out, and waiting for lightning to strike. A lack of logging in
these areas for many years has allowed several generations of trees to die and
accumulate on the ground, while years of fire suppression has prevented small
fires from burning much of this away naturally via cool low level fires. It is
only when a lot of detritus accumulates on the ground that the fires reach the
tops of the trees and become wildfires.

Yes, we do need more of this, and engaging people across the spectrum will help
use not only get our ideas out, but help correct much of the disinformation out
there.

Root for the Airbus 3XX, then.

Boeing hasn't bothered pushing at the large end of the subsonic spectrum
since the 747-400 -- they keep dreaming up ideas about stretched deck
747s then dropping them and working on things like the 777 instead. The
777 makes a lot of sense as an incremental project -- low risk, high
reward -- but little in the way of limit-shattering excitement.

If the A3XX is successful, Boeing are going to feel very pinched around
2008; the ageing 747 is already being nibbled away at the low end by
the 777 and A340, and by 2006 the process will start at the high end when
the 3XX is on sale.

Boeing will then have a choice: try and build a 3XX-beater -- a
super-Jumbo -- or do something completely new. The super-Jumbo won't be
easy; by that point the 747 family will be over forty years old, so my
guess is a new airframe will be in order. However, if the Asian economies
have stabilised, a 350 seater SST would give them a very interesting
market proposition.

(Or it could be the Tupolev 244 team in combination with Airbus and some
indigenous Japanese consortium. But -- as a non aerospace insider --
my money's on Boeing building the next SST ...)

Business 2.0 has an interview with John Gage, chief of research at Sun 
Microsystems. He talks about transparency--a recent topic here, noting the 
large number of cameras installed in England and the future effects of 
transparency on transaction costs. (Want to know who dented your car 
without leaving a note--the camera will tell you..) He also (on p.6 & 7) 
comments on the Grameen Foundation microloan approach, which some of us 
have discussed. It seems to be working.

>I changed my surname when I got married, to my wife's name

May I ask why the two of you wanted the same last name?

is the reason Symbolism.. Convenience.. something else?

When I was married, my spouse and I chose to keep our own names.
I like my name and I have a long publication record with it,
however my ex didn't like his name, and changed both his first
and last names, 5 years into our relationship. We still found
though that the occassional stranger called him, Mr {my last name},
and less-often, me, Mrs. {his last name}.

My name seems to fit all of criteria in your post, i.e.

>Weird
>Confusing to spell
>Mistaken for another gender
>Only one in the phone book
>Not listed on any off-the-shelf "personalised" merchandise


I am still using my original name. My Dad did very well, by
giving me, a baffling and distinctive person, a baffling and
distinctive name.

Well, I have an exceedingly ordinary name, so maybe I should look into my
pornstar name...

Uh... Simon Brock!   Not bad, not bad... maybe I should consider a career
change.



I've actually had good opportunities and reasons to change my name, but to
tell you the truth I really like my name!  It might be ordinary-- I,
however, am not.

I got the idea to change my name on my 51st birthday several months ago and
my daughter Kat and I had been discussing possibilities.  When we first saw
your name we both thought it was one of the most beautiful names we'd ever
seen or heard.

My father picked the name Barbara for me. My grandmother told me the source
of my father's pleasure in the name:  During WWII many English children were
sent to the USA so they wouldn't be in danger from the bombing.  One of
these was a teenaged girl by the name of Barbara who was sent to Austin
where my father met her and fell in love.  They were too young to think of
marriage, and after the bombings stopped Barbara went home and my father
never saw her again.  He still has a photograph of the two of them sitting
with their heads close together on my grandfather's boat. So I suppose the
personal meaning of my name is "unfulfilled love." (As life turned out, I
grew up and married a British man)

Barbara

Hey, I like this idea!  Let me see...Penelope Pinkard.  Nah, don't think it
works.

I am not sure I disagree with your comments on the state of affairs in the 
Balkans over the last several decades. The we I refer to is the U.S. and 
European citizens. I toyed with Libertarism back when the economy really 
sucked back in the late 1970's, but I currently believe it to be unworkable, 
in large part because I believe we lack the nanotechnology to implement it. 
This seems to be the first economy driven by technology only. The Nano era is 
not here yet.  I am not attempting to embue guilt or a sense of 
responsibility upon you. But there have to be a sense of  international law 
in this era. The technology to inflict heavy damage has grown. I believe you 
cannot live under your own fig tree, so to speak, forever. People with vastly 
different values might not chose to let you in peace.

 There's that plural again!  I must be missing something.  Are you a member
 of the government?  Where did you affect the decision-making process?  Did
 Tony Blair or Bill Clinton consult with you before they decided to give
 authorization to bomb?  Or perhaps you flew missions over Belgrade?
 
 As for me, I was a critic of the war, before, during, and after the war.
 (See below.)

 Okay.  Hey, everyone!  Look who's not a fan of the Ustasha!  Done.  Max
 Power gets things done.

 True.  Franjo Tudjman's died recently.  I.e., he lived a long and bloody
 life.  His party only lost power a few months ago.  The Mesic-Racan
 government seems much better and likely to reform in the direction away from
 nationalist authoritarianism.  Of course, the deed is done, so some might
 argue that Tudjman's group completed their mission.
 
 > For all their past

 That depends on when you start looking.  If you look in 1941, the Ustasha
 wins hands down.  If you look in the 1990s, surely, it's hard to say.  But
 even if they did not, killing innocents is wrong period, no matter who's
 doing it or when.

 The process was a little different.  I think, basically, all sides wanted
 regions wherein their ethnic group was a sizeable majority and no threat
 existed to its power.  (The same process, sadly, seems to be taken place in
 Ethiopia and Eritria right now, though, of course, no one is suggesting NATO
 get involved.)  Or, more likely, the leaders used ethnicity to stay in or
 expand their power with this kind of logic.  My point was merely Croatia
 gets a free pass here (as does just about every other nation state that
 plays the ethnic cleansing game), by the U.S. State Department and by
 Michael Lorrey.
 
 In some cases, e.g., Indonesia, it would not even be a matter of going in
 and fighting against that government, but just of cutting of military aid.
 President Clinton had a chance to do that before the massacres in East
 Timor.  He did not and notably few people were vocal on this.

 It's no one's responsibility to save the planet.  That said, if you feel the
 urge, do so, but leave those who just want to work on their small
 neighborhood alone.  Don't think you have the moral high ground because you
 want to save some strangers half a world away, regardless of whether it will
 work.  (Results are very important.  Here, we have lots of dead people and a
 region in shambles.  IMHO, the Kosovar Albanians were better before the war
 than now, especially the ones who are now dead.  Same for me.  I wouldn't
 want someone rescuing me by getting me killed.)
 
 And I thought this list was full of libertarians, not war loving hawks!:)
 
 Later!

Actually, Boeing was doing development studies for a large super Jumbo
6-8 years ago that was so big it had to fold its wings up after landing
in order to fit in normal airports.

Now it all makes sense.  If "asymmetric" = not symmetric, then
Amara = not mara, therefor Amara is an angel who sits upon
a somnolent one giving the slumberer pleasant dreams.  spike

Yes, but some of us will happier than others....  For example, let's say 
that I'm one of the elite philosopher kings in this BNW (Brave New World), 
or just one of the police.  Clearly, I should have the ability to take 
CONTROL when things aren't going exactly the way I think is best, right?  
Like today, as I was lashing stuff on my motorcycle, and I see these two 
sweet young things (total strangers) approaching on the sidewalk.  So, 
despite my best efforts as they appoach - moving stuff out of the way, etc. 
to be polite, they get to within fifteen feet and then cross the street, 
requiring them to fight thru heavy shrubbery -just to not get any closer to 
me.  In broad daylight in a very safe area with continuous traffic....
But in our BNW, if I had the proper system access - "legal" or not - then I 
could just adjust a few little dollips of their hormones here and there as 
they approached, and my evening might be very different indeed.

Wow!  I just knew that as soon as I stopped systematically covering the 
field for the magazines, then they would finally actually release the thing. 
  Really nice.  I saw it at SIGGRAPH or E3 or one of the other shows a 
couple years back, and it just blew me away.  However, a couple of the 
official Trinity dealers then told me that they had been waiting forever, 
living on promises from Play, and were really fed up.
I talked with one of the two major developers of Trinity at the last show 
where I saw it and asked them if there was anything in the hardware that 
would prevent them from using trigger points or areas in the 3D virtual sets 
for real-time interactions with the Virtual environment.  He told me that 
nothing stopped it except that the software didn't yet support it - but it 
was a good idea.

So, with Trinity and a little programming work you could have - for a mere 
$10,000+ - a high-def real-time VR system that puts you directly into a 3D 
VR, with interactions, shadows, reflections, the whole Monte.

I suppose that it's possible to have an immune response to foreign 
mitochondria, but it doesn't seem likely.  Your body probably has a rather 
wide variety of mitochondrial genotypes to start, from the original egg, and 
then they tend to mutate prettty radically, which is a problem, but not 
involving the immune system to my knowledge.

Phil - not Damien

But isn't that why we have the separation of powers?  Isn't it the Judicial
Branch's responsibility to *judge* the constitutionality of any laws that
Congress passes?  Since when does a Judge become a pawn to the Legislative
Branch while simultaneously acting as if he was the Executive Branch when he
"enforces" the law as you put it?

Something is very rotten in Denmark here.

Though I should note that using hushmail for actual posts, especially
posts that might get archived on the Web, is probably a good idea.  Even
if you're sending it to a relative, it's a good idea; they might hit

Does civil disobedience work if it's anonymous?

Steal instead from Poofy Wellington and James Blish:

"Spike Aleph-null"

This surname has the advantage of infinity combined with what looks like
its own historical negation. The first name, although it would create
confusion on this list, slips more readily from the lips than "Singularity"
or "Exponentiating Powers of Sublime Wonderfulness".

a mara is also a kind of animal very simmilar to a hare that hangs around
patagonia (southern bit of argentina) and is used as a (rare) female name
over there.

Absolutely.


The official corporate line is that they were holding back on the release
date because of their realization that they had the opportunity to build a
whole next generation editing template into the damn thing and they had to
hold back.  Punctuated equilibrium I figure.

Uh-uh.  Free will always be taken for granted.  We only care about the
things that we have to work for.  'Tis the nature of the beast.  If the
Aston Martin Volante suddenly becomes free, it will simply cease to be as
desirable an automobile.  -Everybody- will be driving one.  Ho hum.

Boring, boring, boring.

Exclusivity is interesting.  We care about things that are unique, hard to
attain and special.  Personally I'm glad that we are attracted to the
novel-- it keeps us moving.  Free is boring.

And to repeat:

Boring, boring, boring.


You can have your free boring boring Napster and your free boring boring
'freeness,' and your free boring boring 'transparent,' no secrets, no
mystery, no special, bland boring boring grey boring flat flatness.

Then your usage is still a bit wrong, since the US and European citizens,
also, were not part of the decision-making process, especially since during
the war, in some countries, majorities were against it, such as Italy and
Germany.  In most, there was sizeable (and mostly ignored) opposition to
it -- even the US.  But it's great to use the plural.  So continue!:)

I don't follow you here.  Freedom only works if one has nanotechnology?

It's funny that the more libertarian a nation is, typically, the better off
its economy and its society as a whole is.  (Surely, there are
counterexamples to the first part.  Saudi Arabia, sitting on top of huge oil
reserves, is not doing to badly financially, but its society is not so
great, especially with strict internal control to barely suppress those who
are trying to overthrow its monarchy.)  This alone makes me question your
claim.

Well, you certainly fooled me.  In fact, rereading your posts, I find it
hard to interpret them any other way -- even after your above assertion.

> in this era.

And what is that law to be like?  NATO violated current international law by
attacking a nation which was not an aggressor.  It also violated its own
charter, since it is only supposed to attack when one of its members is
attacked.  Also, the bombing itself -- the targets chosen -- are in conflict
with international law.  (Of course, NATO members pay for and run the Hague,
so I don't expect the Serbian brief filed there to go far.)

This is a strange view to take, especially since Serbia did not attack
another country.  Nor did it use high tech weapons.  Its military, in fact,
is outdated in terms of technology.

Also, interventionism of the sort the US is practicing is just the kind of
thing that breeds counter-interventions.  Note that neither Switzerland or
Sweden are the targets of Islamic terrorists.  How come they are able to
"live under [their] own fig tree"?

Note, too, that the countries with advanced technologies and militaries that
use them are in NATO.  Serbia flew no stealth aircraft.  Nor does it have
satelites.  Nor is it capable of all the things NATO members are, militarily
or technologically.

Needless to say, your reasoning is strange and does not, in any way
perceptible way, lead to the conclusions you're for.  The part about
technology makes no sense in this context.

Cheers!

bit sequences don't read legal books and don't know if they're copyrighted

The journal "Cell" reports that the hiding place of skin stem cells has been
found at last, it turns out they're in the roots of hair follicles. The implications
for burn victims and cosmetic surgery is obvious, it will probably yields clues
into the inner workings of melanoma too.

Question my claim all you want ;-)  By the way dear old Saudi is as about 
as pro-capitalist, mercantilist as you get, from and economic point of 
view. And yes, you need nanotechnology to have real freedom. Otherwise 
what's all the fuss about on the mailing list? Libertarianism never has 
been really tested out, has it? In fact I suppose the largest intellectual 
contributors to Extropianism, may not indeed be Libertarians or agree with 
its logical positivist philosophy of Libertarians. My examples would be 
Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, et al. Max More may be devoted to Libertarianism, 
(or not) but I doubt if everyone on this list is. Otherwise it would be 
subscribe libertarian@majordomo.org or whatever. On getting rid of

Rosenbloom, contributing to the common good, I tend to say fuggedabodit

reserves, is not doing to badly financially, but its society is not so
great, especially with strict internal control to barely suppress those who
are trying to overthrow its monarchy.)  This alone makes me question your
claim.

In July of 1999 a molecular switch was made for the first time, but the switch could
only be thrown once. By November 1999 they had a switch that could be turned
on and off many times but it had to be kept close to absolute zero and stopped working
after a few hours. In today's issue of Science James Heath report on a molecular switch
that works at room temperature and shown no signs of wearing out. Even better, you can
throw the switch with electricity or with light. Even better, not only do the electrical
characteristics change when the switch is thrown so does its color, from green to maroon.

Title
  Lipophilic HMG-CoA
  reductase inhibitors increase myocardial stunning in dogs.
Source
  Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology.  35(2):256-62, 2000 Feb.
Abstract
  Pretreatment of dogs with simvastatin, a lipophilic
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
  reductase inhibitor, increases myocardial contractile
  dysfunction during reperfusion after ischemia (stunning), with reduction of
  tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This was thought to be a consequence of
  prevention of ubiquinone biosynthesis by the lipophilic
  inhibitor in the myocardial cell. We examined whether other
  lipophilic HMG-CoA
  reductase inhibitors also influence myocardial stunning in
  dogs. Vehicle, atorvastatin (2 mg/ kg/day), fluvastatin (4 mg/kg/day), or
  cerivastatin (40 microg/kg/ day) was orally administered for 3 weeks.
  Hydrophilic pravastatin (4 mg/kg/day) also was given. After 3 weeks,
  pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15-min left anterior
  descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 2-h reperfusion. Myocardial
  segment function was determined by sonomicrometry. Tissue levels of ATP were
  determined in 2-h reperfused hearts. All inhibitors significantly decreased
  serum cholesterol level. The three lipophilic inhibitors
  resulted in a worsening of segment function in the reperfused myocardium, as
  compared with the vehicle group. The levels of ATP in the atorvastatin,
  fluvastatin, and cerivastatin groups were significantly lower than that in
  the vehicle group. These results confirm that lipophilic
  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors enhance
  myocardial stunning in association with ATP reduction after ischemia and
  reperfusion.

Hmmm... I wonder if anyone has ever done a study of skin cancer
incidence in people who've had lots of elecrolysis or laser diode hair
removal.  (Laser diode is the latest rage, you can't look at the
classified ads in a southern californica newspaper without seeing a
zillion pitches for the service.  The outfit that makes the lasers must
be making bucks hand over fist.)

That was mentioned in the article, it seems like it should cause more skin
cancer, but no such increase has ever been found , nobody knows why.

Yes, interesting.

To keep you up to date with developments on the TV channel, response has
been enormous from the nu-age and alternative fraternity, and I am talking
to one or two serious business operations about getting it off the ground.

It makes more sense to run a single "Nu Age" channel, which will include
some *after-human/ futurist*(trans/post-/extropian) programming. The weight
of advertising interest is at present from alternative medicine &c.

Thanks to those who have contacted me offering support. Am starting to put a
prospectus page together at www.multi.co.uk/TV.htm .....

Regards the forest fire comments ..... I heard on British TV that there had
been a drought and unusual weather
(lightening storms without rain) .... nothing about the disaster being
caused by environmentalists.
Sure, fire-breaks are a good idea and should have been in place, but this
isn't necessarily what commercial logging provides.

If I can choose the street of the house I lived in most of the time growing 
up, and my second pet (the first one whose name I remember), I get an 
excellent porn star name... at least if I were female:

Alexandria Slinky

My name is perfectly ordinary, though it took some work to get it
there. That makes it partly a birth name and partly chosen; I adopted
the distinctive (and exotic to an American pre-teen) Icelandic ethnic
form of my first name, and found myself compelled by aesthetics to
restore the "s" in my surname that had been dropped in
Americanization in my grandfather's generation.  Surnames turn over
each generation in Iceland, where your surname is your father's first
name followed by sson or dottir.  Historic siblings Leivur (Leif)
Eriksson and Freydis Eriksdottir are a good example of how it works. 
My name "should" be Eirikur Jonasson by the old ways.  My
greatgrandfather changed his surname to agree with his first name to
make Americanization easier!  Hallgrimur Jonasson became Hallgrimur
Hallgrimsson.  Easier, yeah, right.  So it seemed to me, even at a
fairly early age, that I had right of choice.  My father was very
much against it though.

Linguistically, the Old Norse Eirikur becomes Erik and then Eric as
the inflected endings were eventually dropped except in Iceland
itself.  The "ur" is actually the same inflection (a tag meaning
masculine singular noun) as the "us" in classical Latin names like
Julius, Marcus, etc.  It's interesting how Indoeuropean languages
have actually lost a lot of formal structure.  It makes me wonder how
that complexity came to be in the first place, if we came to do
pretty well without it.

If I said it was Solaris, I bet everyone would tell me to switch to
Solaris Yudkowsky.

Actually, the English name would be Solomon... which is still pretty
good, especially when you consider the mythological connotations. 
(According to legend, King Solomon laid down the essential laws
governing genies - the djinni - that held forever after.)

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
Bone marrow stem cells can become brain cells

The August 15 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience Research reported an
exciting breakthrough funded by the Christopher Reeve Paralysis
Foundation.  Researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey have developed the first successful procedure to transform
cultured bone marrow stromal stem cells exclusively into nerve cells, or
neurons.  It had previously been found that the brain contains stem cells,
which are undifferentiated immature cells, that can be coaxed into
becoming different types of nerve cells.  However, obtaining the necessary
stem cells for this process from deep within the brain is risky, and
patients who receive cells cultured from donors must take
immunosuppressive drugs to help avoid rejection.  The breakthrough
reported this week will make available an unlimited source of one's own
cells to treat a variety of conditions, such as spinal cord injury,
stroke, brain trauma, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's diseases.

The study involved obtaining bone marrow stem cells from rats and humans
and culturing them according to the researchers' protocol, using time
lapse photography to track the cells' progression into neurons.  Specific
gene products were confirmed that identified the transformed cells.  The
process was accomplished in a matter of hours, and some of the neurons
even began to form connections with other neurons.

 "Now that we have been able to differentiate human bone marrow stromal
stem cells into neurons, it creates the exciting possibility in the future
for the treatment of neurological diseases. Research currently being
conducted on rats with spinal paralysis suggests that stem cell
transplants can encourage return of function," stated lead study author
Dr. Ira Black, chair of the Department of Neurosciences at the University
of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Robert Wood Johnson Medical
School.

The next stage is transplantation of these nerve cells into the brain and
spinal cord of animals.


LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE
Interview:  Reinventing the brain

Ever thought about growing a new brain? It may not be as far-fetched as
you think. Dr. Fred H. Gage of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California
has discovered baby brain cells deep inside the adult brain that can grow
up to become new brain. His work is blowing apart the notion that a
damaged brain or spinal cord can't be fixed. Life Extension Magazine's
contributor, Terri Mitchell, interviews Dr. Gage:

TM:  . . .  isn't "stem cell" a term usually used for cells in bone marrow
that turn into blood cells-are you saying the brain has stem cells too?

FG: They fit the criteria for stem cells, so, yes, the brain has
undifferentiated cells that "grow up" to become neurons and glial cells
and all the different cells in the brain. The discovery of these dividing
cells helped people to overcome the idea that the brain can't make new
neurons. The trick in understanding how the brain could make new neurons
came with the identification in the adult brain areas where these baby
cells persist throughout life. Before, the thinking had been that you
couldn't replace brain cells because of all their elaborate connections
and what they store-they're such differentiated and complex cells.

TM: What do stem cells do?

FG: A stem cell is a cell that self-renews-that means when it divides, it
creates another stem cell and also can become a mature cell. That's one
feature. The second feature of a stem cell is that it can turn into
different types of brain cells. And we've proven that you can take stem
cells out of the brain, put them in culture, transplant them back into an
adult brain, and they'll pick up where they left off. We haven't done this
in humans yet. But given the similarities between the work we've seen in
animals and humans to date, I think we're confident that what we're
dealing with is a cell that will act this way.

PROTOCOL
Trauma

Trauma may be described as a body wound or shock due to accident or
injury. Permanent injury or death due to trauma is often caused by free
radicals generated when the tissues of the body are physically disrupted.
This is well-documented in spinal cord injury cases where the free-radical
damage that occurs immediately after the injury causes permanent
paralysis.

Antioxidants such as vitamin E, glutathione, and palm oil tocotrienols
should immediately be administered to most victims of trauma to protect
against free-radical injury. Trauma involving massive bleeding may
preclude the use of antioxidants such as gingko that could accelerate
hemorrhaging.

Protecting Against Paralysis

In laboratory studies where two groups of animals were exposed to the same
traumatic force, animals given high doses of vitamin C died less
frequently than animals not given vitamin C. Antioxidants appear to
protect against many forms of permanent damage inflicted by trauma.

The hormone pregnenolone has been shown to protect against paralysis from
spinal cord injury in laboratory animals. The immediate administration of
400 mg of pregnenolone, along with 800 IU of vitamin E, to a spinal injury
patient might be advisable. Vitamin E could speed the bleeding process, so
do not use Vitamin E if excessive bleeding is occurring.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2912/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
Vitamin E capsules

Vitamin E is an antioxidant which can help keep you looking younger by
retarding cellular aging due to oxidation. It supplies oxygen to the body
to promote endurance, works with vitamin A to protect the lungs from
pollution, prevents and dissolves blood clots, accelerates healing, helps
to prevent scar tissue, and lowers the risk of ischemic heart disease.

Vitamin E capsules are the dry, powder form which does not have the
potential of turning rancid that vitamin E oil capsules have.

Trying selling your wares in Saudi Arabia without a license.  Try also doing
things like having sex with who you want to and let the law there know about
it.

If it wasn't for the oil, I bet, Saudi Arabia would be just another poor
nation, probably a lot like Bangladesh.

Also, as a terminological matter, "capitalist" and "merchantilist" are a bit
contradictory.  Merchantilism as an economic system is anticapitalist to a
large extent, especially since it restrains trade.  Maybe you're using it in
some other sense.

True, though the less government control a given society has over its
population, generally, the better off that society is.  That is history.
It's sort of like saying

More confusion.  So?  The greatest thinkers in history often held despicable
political ideas.  Einstein was a socialist, e.g.  Does this make socialism
fine?

Also, logical positivism is not the philosophy of any major libertarians I
know.

Then follow them.  No need to think or discuss.  After all, they have it all
worked out.  Just read and agree, right?:)

My point with my comment was not everyone on this list should become a
libertarian.  It was just a lament on the fact that almost everyone who has
responded to me on the Kosovo War has been for it.  Not one other here has
spoken against it -- at least, not to my recollection.  And at least two
people have given it their thumbs up.  I find that rather strange because I
bet on any other list, on this topic, I'd find people who vary on that.

It's also strange because of any of you value sentient life, then you should
be worried when sentients slaughter each other.  (Not to mention, resources
wasted on wars are resources that could be used for other things, such as
technoprogress.  Also, would you want the present governments, habituated as
they are to mass murder, to have nanotech, AI, and such?)

Don't you think that there will be a transitional period, as I hint at in my
parenthetic comment?  I don't want to perfect tyranny then hope it backs
down once it has even greater levels of technology at its disposal, which is
why I'm speaking out against the Kosovo War and other such interventions,
especially since the transition will probably take place here in the West.

Wow! Leaving aside trivialties such as major burn victims and cancer

I am against all war, including the US involvement in the Kosovo War.  That
one was kinda tricky because the notion was that by intervening, more lives
were saved than were lost.  I sure hope that is true, however I would prefer
to see peace achieved by having all countries owning outrageously advanced
defense technologies, that make them too expensive to attack.  In the long
run machines are very cheap compared to war.  I am interested in seeing
the development of weapons that can *only* be used to defend, but are
useless for attack.  Such things exist.

Another reason that war was difficult was that it was an internal conflict.
Even libertarians have a hard time seeing what is the right thing to do there.
Im open to suggestion.  spike

I can't speak for anyone else, but I didn't reply because I had already 
stated my opinion on the subject many times before (not on this list, though.)
I don't think that we (the economic superpowers) have a mandate to 
interfere with the affairs of other countries when they don't threaten the 
life and livelihood of our citizens. I can think of a thousand better 
things to spend my tax dollars on than shooting eastern Europeans when 
they're perfectly happy to shoot each other for free.
That's not a particularly humanitarian sentiment, but I never suggested 
that I was a humanitarian..

-The US Navy had announced that it had registered two explosions the second much
greater than the first. This has now been confirmed by Norwegian Seismologists
who say there was one explosion at 0728 and 27 sec registering about 1.5 on the
Richter scale. The second at 0730 and 42 sec registering about 3.5 on the
Richter scale (equivalent to one to two tons of TNT explosive detonated
underwater)
-There where 10 senior naval officers on board as observers.
-There has been a lot of contact between NATO (and some NATO members
independently) and the Russians on this matter. There have even been two visits
from Russian representatives at NATO headquarters.
- 2/3 of the crew could have been killed by the explosion that sunk the sub
according to Jane's.
-The K-141 Kursk was one of the Russian subs with the best trained crews, and
was soon to be deployed in the Mediterranean as part of a carrier group. This
deployment is/was planned as a show of force, to remind the world that Russia is
still a world power. The major exercise in which the Kursk was taking part was a
prelude to this deployment. Interestingly this task force is to be led by the
Aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, which had to be towed back to port a few months ago,
while taking part in another such deployment.

Why did they wait?
-The hatches on the Kursk are compatible with the LR5 rescue submarine sent by
the British. And the Russians were very likely to know that from the beginning.
- The first estimates had said there should be enough air left until early
friday, why take risks? Knowing 48 hr at least were needed if everything went
well to get outside help.
-Why was the 'foreign' rescue mission not allowed to land and depart from the
military base, which was closest but had instead to take a longer route.

<specualation>
Putin is being heavily criticized at home for his apparent lack of interest in
the matter.
Russian military Top brass  seem to be resisting foreign 'interference' and even
leaking 'rumors' of foreign responsibility in the accident with Defense minister
Sergeyev (ex-commander of strategic rocket forces (nuclear forces), and a noted
anti western) backing these stories (i.e. US sub 'ramming' the Kursk, reports of
another sub resting on the sea floor then secretly limping back to norway
etc...). If so, Putin is likely to have at least not resisted the military,
because he is a strong supporter of a 'strong' Russia. We may have seen some
political infighting, with some supporting foreign help and openness while
others, backed by the defense minister  and the military preferring to keep the
lid on the accident and avoiding 'outsiders' meddling in their affairs. The
decision may have been to try and keep the lid on the whole story (the story was
only revealed 2 days later and not by the government or the military), and the
military would try it's own rescue.
Either they had to concede to a Wednesday deadline (+ 48hrs needed for foreign
help to arrive would coincide with the first estimates on amount of air left ,
which was early Friday)
Or they were forced into accepting foreign assistance because of the public
outrage.
In any case everyone seems to have lost in this affair, first and foremost the
sailors of the Kursk, of course. The military and government leaders (including
Putin) have now to endure the public outrage, because they have not done
everything that could be done to save the sailors, and on the international
front Russia will have lost face and prestige, because of having to rely on its
'enemy'  for help. Ironically the image that NATO is still the great enemy that
they have themselves in a large part created for their political purposes, will
now work against them.
I just wonder if (or hope that) the Sailors, if any are still alive, and their
families know that even the 'enemy' thinks of them as men, and that our thoughts
go with them.

I cannot imagine this kind of killings going on in the Balkans and not 
drawing the Russians in, as well as the Croats, and the Albanians, which 
basically; because it would have continued in full forced would have 
under-mined Europe elsewhere. Its a domino theory, but one, without some kind

conflagration.

Convenience mostly; Jodie didn't worry one way or the other, but I wanted us
all to have the same last name - it's an IT person thing I think, a
functionality concern; I wanted a decent top level identifier.

Seeing I was the one with the issue, I decided to take it apon myself to
solve it; so I changed my surname. It's worked out very well. Changing your
name, like getting rid of all your crap and moving somewhere with nothing,
is a very cleansing experience; highly recommended.





When I was married, my spouse and I chose to keep our own names.
I like my name and I have a long publication record with it,
however my ex didn't like his name, and changed both his first
and last names, 5 years into our relationship. We still found
though that the occassional stranger called him, Mr {my last name},
and less-often, me, Mrs. {his last name}.

Do you find this a helpful thing? The gender confusion is sometimes
annoying, sometimes useful. Like when I was in highschool, and there was a
school exchange with another school from a long way away, a bunch of people
going from each school to the other, and being billetted with families
there. I was mistakenly assigned to be billetted by a girl, rather than a
boy, because they thought I must be a girl from my name. Initially
embarrassing, it turned out rather well...

When we registered Lochlainn's birth, Jodie and filled in our details as
mother and father; then we received a letter from BD&M, because of some
minor beaurocratic crud that needed clearing up. They wrote to me as the
mother, and Jodie as the father, even though we were clearly listed as the
other way round on the form.

I remember reading Edward deBono talking about intelligence as being like
owning a fast car; doesn't make you a good driver. Stuff like the above
shows that some people are just  catching the bus.

On Australian TV recently, they had a variant of this; Pornstar name = Pet's
name as first name, Street name as surname. All my pets are dead, so I can't

Well, I have an exceedingly ordinary name, so maybe I should look into my
pornstar name...

Uh... Simon Brock!   Not bad, not bad... maybe I should consider a career
change.



I've actually had good opportunities and reasons to change my name, but to
tell you the truth I really like my name!  It might be ordinary-- I,
however, am not.

I'm here...

It's a little better than that...I've been keeping records for some time now 
and with my new kitty-kat (550 hp 3406E cut back to 475 hp) I'm averaging a 
consistent 5.5 mpg over the last 80 thousand miles or so.

Fuel economy depends (as you are undoubtedly aware) on a number of 
things...not the least of which is aerodynamics....

I have NO aero dynamics....I pull a RGN and haul overdimensional 
loads...."high wide and heavy".....kinda like lead parachutes...

So if **I** can get 5.5mpg on a consistent basis (with one of the largest 
"off the shelf" engines on the market...<ok...there is a 600>) then I would 
assume that the more aerodynamic rigs (just about anything else...but 
particularly boxes...) would get in the neighborhood of 6 to 7mpg...

Which is what they claim...some claim as much as 8.......

But even a box isn't very aerodynamic...

Timothy,

I am from Portugal, a country of seamen, and my
thoughts, too, go for those sailors.
Let's hope they are alive and that this sad episode
will help us all in the right direction.

It's amusing to see you refer to your "new" vehicle that has 80,000
miles on it.  Back in my cab driving days, one vehicle that I drove
regularly (admittedly with relief drivers who kept it on the road almost
24/7) turned over 100,000 after ten months- and all of that was city
driving.

Funny that this scenario did not happen in the ten years the recent troubles
have been going on for.  Since the early 1990s, a lot of pundits in America
and Europe have argued that the Balkan conflicts would spread.  In fact,
they did not.  Only in 1994-5 did NATO get involved and then in came in on
the side of Bosnian Muslims (where it pretty much allowed them to attack
Bosnia Serbs; also allowed Croatia a free hand against Serbs in its region
with no complaints from Russia).  NATO and most outside parties, including
the Russians, did not get deeply involved again until the 1999 Kosovo War.

If the Balkans conflicts were going to spread, they would have spread a lot
sooner.  Most of the bloodies fighting is now over and has been over for
years.  So the "war will spread if we don't stop it" theory appears
discredited in this case.

(BTW, Albania is no shape to hurt anyone.  Albanian arms might support the
KLA, but this is not because the Albanian army or government is involved.
Rather, that nations government and military pretty much have collapsed.
This has created an arms market because soldiers are selling weapons for
food and other goods.  Albania, right now, is incapable of doing any
military operations beyond its borders -- that is, very unlikely to get
involved in any Balkan conflict as a participant.)

Add to this, Europeans in general were not getting involved until a major US
effort to get them involved was underway.  No grand alliances formed among
pro- or anti-Serb lines.  The 1990s were not like the 1900s and the 1910s.
(Part of the difference is, of course, the two empires that existed back
then and were disintegrating -- Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungary -- are no
longer around.  Also, the alliance system of that time is no longer in
existence.  Europe in the 1990s and now is not divided by two major
alliances.  In fact, I'd bet Europe is likely to be separated now in this
way -- if things stay the same, e.g., the Russians don't suddenly get their
military will and strength back -- than ever before.)

I don't disagree with your position about staying out of such wars.

Even so, I would state too that the label "humanitarian" does not make a war
any less warlike.  It should also be noted that almost every war that has
been fought is always justified by any side in it as being right and just.
"Humanitarian" is just a new bottle used to sell the same old wine.

That is one of the points in dispute here.  That so few died in Kosovo
before the bombing (a few dozen) and so many after (thousands), kind of
points to that justification for the war being wrong -- at least from its
aftermath, though a lot of this could have been predicted beforehand.  Also,
the tactics used in diplomacy beforehand, make me think that the US
government wanted a war.  Finally, the more evidence I look at during the
Balkan wars of the 1990s, the more I see Serbia being demonized while every
other nation of group is given a free pass on judgment.  I've already
mentioned Croatia enough times here.  No one has refuted my claims.  The
same seems also true of Bosnia, where Bosnian Muslim forces used UN
protection to attack the Serbs.

That said, I don't want to whitewash any side in the conflict, but it's
strange that when all sides are commiting atrocities that only one side gets
singled out and takes all the blame.  That only reinforces the notion that
if you have the better publicists (Serbia, notably, has failed to publicize
its case as the Bosnian Muslims and Kosovar Albanians have) and allies, you
can do what you want.

It sounds like a nice science fiction story, but I don't think it will work.
A purely defensive weapon almost sounds impossible.  For instance, heavy
machine guns (e.g., M-60) are better for defense than attack, but can be
used for both.  Also, any defensive weaponry can be used to cover attacks --
as machine guns are used to defend positions from which other forces attack.

This is not to say defensive weaponry and strategies shouldn't be developed,
but rather that I don't think they are a cure all for war.  They just make
it more costly, which is, in most cases, a good thing.

> Another reason that war was difficult was that it was an internal

My view here is I don't have a solution, but it's easy to see what is not a
solution -- or what makes things worse.  I think a lot of people start here
thinking they can solve these problems and that one of the various sides
(the KLA, the Bosnian Muslim government, the Croatians, etc.) want a just
solution and that none of the sides is able to manipulate the solver or
thwart the solution.  This is exactly the sentiment of the people in the US
government, from President Bush on down, who wanted to get involved in
Somalia.

Also, among Americans, there is the romance of coercion.  They tend, sadly,
on the whole to think force always works.  (This is also a bad lesson to
teach the world: to use force in conflicts.)

Thanks for the promotion, Natasha.  I'm currently working on new material
in two capacities: both solo, and with a space-rock group called Neverness
[Canada].  I plan on having more material from both on .mp3.com in the next
couple months.

So if they started giving them away for free you would't want one?  If 
something only holds value for you because it serves as a status symbol, 
showing that *you* can afford goodies that are unattainable to the lumpen 
masses, that's fine.  For me, I appreciate things for the use I can make of 
them, regardless of the cost.  I suppose you are the kind of person who 
would rather pay for a web browser like Opera, than get a more powerful 
program like MSIE for free.  Not so for me.

But never fear, I'm sure there will always be something for you to spend 
your money on in order to get the sort of exclusivity you're after.  
Personally, I'm not interested.

I use "we" because I'm a citizen of one of those superpowers.. Feel free to 
include yourself in the plural, or not. Heh.
Wars are always going to be warlike.. Some of them are fought for more 
"human" reasons than others. People tend to get shot no matter what, though.

I've been an observer and secret student of memetics and extropy related subjects for a while, admittedly from a more sociological than mathematical angle, and having been accepted as a member of this forum, there are a few questions I would like to pose.

First of all, let me say that I am strong believer in the future, a future including humanity as a species. And I truely feel that all efforts of extropians to raise public awareness and acceptance concerning current adaptions necessary to progress towards such a future are desperately needed. By the same token, I feel that political or social control meddling with evolution in a way which exceeds the bare necessities of our humanity, are a hinderance in this same evolutionary process, and I therefore welcome and agree with extropians' position on this issue. 

But having said this, I feel there is a limit to tolerance, where the quality itself starts destroying what it was meant to preserve - a natural development of superiority of one trait compared to another. This limit obviously would be exceeded if tolerance were applied to restrictive concepts (excessive regulations, taxation, welfare support and others preventing a relatively undisturbed evolution), thereby allowing the continuation of such restrictive concepts. 

A similar misguided aplication of tolerance concerns violations against children. A child is by nature weaker than an adult, is however at the same time tomorrow's adult and therefore the future of humanity. Any violation against children therefore potentially disrupts evolution in a way that should no longer happen based on traits developed in humans. It is one thing for a lion to eat the pups of a rivalling male - but the fact of humans having transcended this need is part and parcel of their very humanity. 

What is my point? I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists are guilty of sexually abusing children (Keith Henson, for example), and I recently came across a persistent rumor that the same is true of Max More (incidentally a friend of Henson?) as well. For obvious reasons as outlined above, I do not consider this to be their private business. But I have so far failed to see reactions or statements from any extropians on this subject, which I consider a moral omission. 

Any comments?

Please do not consider this post a flame, because it is not. It is a factual - though critical -  inquiry, based on my sincere view that a subject's advance will be hampered by deficencies in credibility and trustworthyness of its exponents, and therefore deserves an honest answer. The future can not be approached without dealing with present issues that might bar the road to it.

Let me begin this reply with my first observation:  When making attacks in 
a public forum, if one does not wish them to be perceived as a direct attack
on someone, then one shoudl leave out pertinent personal details.  Especially
names. 

> I've been an observer and secret student of memetics and extropy related subjects for a while, admittedly from a more sociological than mathematical angle, and having been accepted as a member of this forum, there are a few questions I would like to pose.

Then pose your questions, and leave the gratuitous personal details out of it,
and youmight be taken more seriously.  I am at the edge of my own personal self
control to remain at all civil to someone who would act as irresponsibly as you
have in this post.
> 
> A similar misguided aplication of tolerance concerns violations against children.

It is one thing for a lion to eat the pups of a rivalling male - but the fact of humans having transcended this need is part and parcel of their very humanity. 
>

And here we come to the crux of the problem withy our post, and apparently your
entire outlook.  WHY did you feel the need to name a specific name, and then
additionally to attempt to tar someone else, with a spurious linkage at best
(... a friend...)?  What exactly are you trying to prove?  Attempting to claim
the moral high ground, or a particular axe to grind?

While we're in the mood for full disclosure, why don't you tell us what your 
particular PERSONAL gripe is with the people you named?  What is it that
drives you to at worst defame the good name of somoene in public, and at best
reveal tawdry detailsin such a way as to imply an inherent value judgement on 
the part of the reader?  Your accusations are rather vague as well - We need
not get into questions as to what you implied versus what may (or may not - 
courts of the world are not infallible) have truly happened.

The ad hominem nature of this attack is unconscionable, and truth be told does
absolutley nothing for your credibility.  As I asked previously, what is your
bone of idsagreement, your personal agenda, which you have so conveniently 
forgotten to mention in your effort to discredit possibly two wonderful minds?
Is it political?  Academic?  A rivalry?

The accusations you make are serious indeed, and merely lodging those 
accusations in a public forum gives them credence they shouldn't otherwise
have.  Your attempt at social engineering shoudl be rejected, but given the
permanent nature of internet communications (this post may be archived in one
of thousands of locations, if not more, most beyond the reach of a proper
defamationa nd expungement order) the damage is incalculable - and irrefutable.
For example, I could alledge that not only you were a homosexual, but had 
contracted HIV from a "paid companion" and knowingly passed it along to 
acquaintances - Not that the former is bad, but it colors many people's 
perceptions of you in a negative light.  Now, these allegations are very much
unlikely to be true, but once I hit "send" this message is a matter of public
record.

>For obvious reasons as outlined above, I do not consider this to be their private business. But I have so far failed to see reactions or statements from any extropians on this subject, which I consider a moral omission. 
> 
> Any comments?

A few, as outlined above.  And a couple more.  I do not feel it necessary nor
even optimal to express my opinions of a private individual's actions in 
public.  How I react and choose to interpret someone's actions is MY OWN 
BUSINESS an not that of any other group, including associates of the person
in question.  This public moralization is one of the memetic structures that
should be stricken from society at large; its damage is incalculable.

As for my opinion in this case, since you so thoughtfully directly solicited 
it:

You shoudl be ashamed of yourself.  Crusader, go home to your minister, your
moral certitude, and your pettyminded moralism.  We have no need of blind 
moralists here.

> 
> Please do not consider this post a flame, because it is not. 

A rose by any other name still smells as sweet.  You have crafted here the 
most odious kind of flame - and you try a disclaimer such as this?  When you
mature enought o know what your own words mean, then you are welcome back.  I
for one will be selecting to ignore any further messages from one whose 
itroduction is drivel such as this.

>It is a factual - though critical -  inquiry, based on my sincere view that a subject's advance will be hampered by deficencies in credibility and trustworthyness of its exponents, and therefore deserves an honest answer. The future can not be approached without dealing with present issues that might bar the road to it.

This would have been a non-issue, most likely, for some time if not ever, had 
you simply showed a measure of restraint.  By making these allegations, you
lend them a credence that is difficult if not impossible to overcome.  I am 
brought to mind of Pat BUchannan's speech in 1992 to the Republican National
Convention in Houston, TX.  His allusion to national guard members being used
to save the elderly membres of a nursing home from the encroaching flames and
"looting gangs of black Los Angelinos bent on destruction" is still cited 
today as factual by many people, even though it has been widely refuted - by 
the National Guard itself.

Either you truly wish ill upon extropianism and by extension upon 
transhumanism, or you are truly ignorant of your actions ina  greater 
socio-psychological context.  Either way, you are a fool.

And my apologies to others on this forum, who are used to a more civil kind
of communicationf rom me.  I could not let this sort of accusation be left 
without some kind of comment - especially bearing the mark of a "sociologist".

I always find it extremely interesting when someone writes a long and
seemingly well-composed post about alleged facts and research regarding
extropians and transhumanists, yet fails to mention the basis or location
of those facts.  So, Jamiro, how about it then: let's see your evidence of
facts and research.  You will have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt
before anyone will hear you out. Otherwise, such allegations are libelous
and derogatory, and could potentially cause a lawsuit towards yourself for
public slander.  And unless you can prove such allegations, you can rest
assured that I, among dozens of others, am willing to be a character
witness for Max or Keith in any such lawsuit.

trustworthyness of its exponents, and therefore deserves an honest answer.

And the potential ramifications of such inane effrontery will not convey
the desired efficacy borne by its incumbent.  Proof, Jamiro, proof.  Don't
pad an attack with sophisticated wording.

Unless you have *proof*, and are willing to post it here, then the
omission is one of fact.  There is no need to discuss, say, my own
recent string of serial murders - because I have committed no such acts.
Without proof, the same likely applies to the others you named.  That is
why it does not get discussed here.

I second that. An accusation by an anonymous person, is nothing more than
mischief.

Let's not compound it by leaving it on the record.

Please forgive me for replying to my own post but this has me thinking.
A few months ago I speculated on the use of the internet for taking
pot shots at public figures.  We extropians have *plenty* of political
opponents, and so if anything I am surprised such attacks have not
occurred before now.

Allow me to speculate that in the last two or three days before the
U.S. presidential elections this November, both W and algore will
become unrepentent child molesters, as will most of their staff.
{This particular accusation appears to be the worst possible brickbat
with which to slime political opponents, for accusations are easy,
defenses are not.}  The news of their improprieties will be widely
disseminated on the internet, perhaps right up into the final hours
before the polls close.  I further predict a flurry of accusations of
financial wrongdoing by both candidates, again in such a way that
is impossible to defend in the short time before the elections.

Let me add to the chorus: I have never heard any untoward rumors
regarding either Max or Keith.  I know both to be morally upstanding,
the finest of gentlemen.  Jamiro's anonymous post is a transparent
attempt at politically motivated slander, which in itself is cowardly
and morally reprehensible, as well as being absurd.

That being said, I urge every extropian to stand fearlessly and
steadfastly in the face of the threat of similar baseless rumors and attack
posts that could victimize any one of us here.  The more prominent
ones among us are at an even greater threat than the more obscure.
We have all posted that which is politically unacceptable to someone
out there in this big world.  We have placed our opinions into the
public record.  Any one of us here could become an infant-raping
old-lady-beater simply for having stated an unpopular opinion.
Do not back down, move forward.  spike

Yup...it's a whole nuther order of magnitude.    My new truck is barely
broke in....when it turns a hundred grand I'm thinking of having it turned
up to it's full rated horsepower.

I've owned two trucks previous to this one.  The last one...a custom
Peterbilt...had about 750,000 miles on it and still brought $50,000 in
trade...it was considered "used' but still in very good shape.

The first one I owned had a million two hundred fifty thousand and change on
it's odometer when I traded it...and I still managed to get about $15,000 in
trade for it.

Trucks are like airplanes (I presume)...in that if they are well maintained
they "just keep on trukin'".....and they are built so that they CAN be
maintained....just about every part on them can be repaired and/or replaced.

Beleive it or not there are working trucks on the road that are (many)
decades old and have (many) MILLIONS of miles on them.  Rare..but there are
a few.

Kinda like the B-52 I suppose....older than their crews...

New Scientist has an interview with Igor Aleksander of Imperial College,
London about his new book "How to build a Mind". From this interview it
seems as though there are several groups around the world working in this
area.

Also, when replying to this thread, do not unnecessarily repost offensive
material.  That just gives it more free air time.  And do not change any
part of the subject line, so we can identify and contain all of it.  spike

This completely crosses the line.  Unless cold hard proof is brought in a court of law there is no business bringing this up publicly at all.  I also second the motion that his/her post be removed from the archives as soon as possible.

Oh yes.  I have one, but I am too much of a lady to say it publicly.

Personal comment: What you say is a lie. Too bad you don't use your real

Official comment: I know Max More. I have known him for years. I know him to 
be an honest, kind and truly friendly person. He is one of the most ethical 
people I have the pleasure of calling friend. 

To spread lies about him is truly abhorrent. Bad,BAD BADD!!! Bad.

Though an advocate of critical thinking, he is not particularly judgmental of 
others. Yet, Max More is extremely scrupulous in own his behavior. He is 
inherently self aware and an exemplar of character.

= ) To claim otherwise is simply ridiculous. 

He is goodhearted and does not deserve any stupid lies. There is nothing 
funny about this practical joke.

Shame on you, whoever you are, whatever your beliefs, for making false and 
potentially damaging accusations -- in writing -- tsk tsk,  and posting them 
in a public forum. I declare to you and to all who read this list: this is a 
bad thing you have done.

Interesting. I suspect his title was inspired by John Pollock's (or is it 
"Pollack's"?) book, "How to Build a Person". I remember Pollock from the 
time he came to speak at USC on his work. He wanted a joint appointment in 
Philosophy and Computer Science, but apparently got a better offer elsewhere.

I've had a copy of Igor Aleksander's previous book, but it's say on my 
shelf unread for about 15 years. Has anyone read it? (I think it's called 
"Reinventing Man").

Onward!

Max

EvMick, have you ever heard of a commercial class rig that was
anything other than a deisel?  Does anyone know about fire engines?
Those arent diesel, surely.

I have a notion about hybrid technology for an 18 wheeler.
One could arrange electric motors at six locations, then haul a
number of modular internal combustion-electric motor
combinations below the cab.  I could imagine a horizontally
opposed four cylinder engine, perhaps even air cooled, adapted
for burning ethanol, displacement of about 1.5 liters each,
optimized to spin about 4k RPM.  Each unit would be
completely modular, perhaps light enough to be hoisted by two
husky boys.  Im estimating each one would turn out about 70
horsepower each, and weigh about 300 pounds with generator
attached.  Undertandable units: about 50 kw and 150 kg each.

Four such engines and about 500 kw-hrs of batteries, which
would weigh about 200 kg, and you would have a truck which
would perhaps be slower to accelerate than your 550 hp rig,
but would cruise the highways at 110 kph without difficulty.
Furthermore, it would be extremely reliable, as each of the
four i.c. engines and each of 6 electric motors would be completely
independent.  Looks like a scheme we could get the failed
Algore administration or the failed George W. administration
to subsidize with tax breaks for fermentation-grade-corn growers.

I think it's cool that you're not interested-- obviously each of us is free
to ascribe value to things by whatever criteria we choose.  However
exclusivity -does- hold tremendous value for lots of people other than you,
and as a result, motivates them to contribute to achieve it.

I'll grant that exclusivity can be extremely arbitrary-- but I fail to see
how that's even a factor.  I am, in fact, in favor of 'artificial'
conventions that create interesting markets-- but that's because I don't
really believe in the word artificial.  (Ok, that's probably another
conversation.)

The fact of the matter is that one tends to automatically take for granted
those things that are plentiful and easy to achieve.  You personally may be
in favor of more free stuff, but I am a really ambitious person... and I am
interested in very exclusive, very difficult to achieve goals.

God, you make it sound like humans would have made it this far without bait.

What frightens me most about the sort of future you want is its apparent
desire to eliminate the positive feedback loops that have driven our species
for so many years.  It doesn't bother me at all that there are lots of young
people out there hungry for status, or money, or recognition, or fame or
whatever.  I happen to be tremendously ambitious myself--  I'm simply not
going to be content under those circumstances.

And, yes, I -do- seek status.  In fact, I'm looking for massive recognition.
I'm an artist and I'm hungry for an audience.  I love creating interesting
experiences for people.  I get a warm glow in my stomach when someone says
something really nice about my work.  Fame is good too.  It's a good
currency to have on this planet.  It's not for everyone, I'll grant that,
and it's a type of power-- and as such, it tends to corrupt.  But I'm
interested in having power.  In being able to choose my own destiny.  In
being empowered to do the sort of work that I love.  In owning an Aston
Martin DB7 Vantage Volante.

Ah, the Volante...

Damn, I am one superficial dude.

Okay, okay, but just one more time... Ah... the Volante...



But you know, it doesn't bother me that, for instance, some scientists might
be hungry for recognition.  I don't require that people contribute out of
the goodness of their hearts.  If a bunch of kids wanna get together and
decide that Action Comics #1 is worth thousands and thousands of dollars, I
say: cool!  You can't just say to me: "But Jason, wouldn't it be a nicer
world if every little boy and girl out there could have an Action Comics #1
of their own?"  Come on!  I don't want to live in even-world!

In fact, I *hate* even-world!  Damn you even-world!  I curse even-world and
all the evil even-worldlians!

Oo... that's kinda fun to say: "evil even-worldlians."

Eliezer,

Save your silver.

Go to Stan Franklin's website, uh, do a Google search for Stan Franklin;
action selection paradigm; Artificial Minds; conscious agent architectures;
gerard sabah; caramel.... in lotsa permutations.

...oh, and check out a very klutzy site http://ai.linux.co.tt

In my taxonomy your kind of mind machines are called Class H (..the H stands
for "hyperbolic";

I'll stick to Class M; the M stands for mammals...

The future promises to be interesting, if not fun.

But, you will probably want to input your own zipcode for the best price
comparison.
Just remember that it is not an American book, rather "English" and it

I understand the need to control the damage, but I must express my personal
outrage at jamiro2002's post.

I have no doubt that he/she/it will be very pleased by the amount of
attention this post has received-- like a vandal taking pleasure in the
results of an act of sabotage.

And to disguise such an inflamatory public accusation as a reasoned
discourse is beyond belief-- absolutely wasted intelligence.  Hey... why
don't you use your mind for something good?

I'm quoting Nadia here, because jamiro2002 should read this twice and let it
soak in:

Title
  Ramipril vs captopril in mild to moderate
  hypertension.
Source
  Journal of the Association of Physicians of India.  42(2):120-3, 1994 Feb.
Abstract
  Ramipril 5 mg once daily was compared to
  Captopril 50 mg twice daily in a randomised, double-blind,
  parallel group study in 60 patients with a diastolic blood pressure between
  95 to 120 mmHg over a period of 2 months. Both drugs in the dose regimen used
  in this study exerted a similar anti-hypertensive effect at the end of 2
  months of treatment resulting in a fall of supine diastolic blood pressure
  with Ramipril = 19.27 +/- 3.34 mmHg and
  Captopril = 19.15 +/- 2.63, in patients receiving the drugs
  without the diuretic. The mean fall in supine diastolic blood pressure 4
  hours after the first dose of Ramipril was 6.5 mmHg and
  Captopril 8 mmHg. None of the patients developed first dose
  hypotension or orthostatic hypotension and there was no significant
  alteration of the heart rate in either group. The serum K+ levels remained
  unchanged in both groups of patients. Both drugs were well tolerated and
  there were no adverse effects observed on the liver, kidney, blood sugar or
  haemopoietic system. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded
  that the antihypertensive efficacy of 5 mg ramipril in a
  once daily dose is equivalent to 50 mg captopril given twice
  daily. However an appreciably greater number of patients reported improvement
  in the "quality of life' parameters with ramipril as
  compared to captopril. Thus for the routine treatment of
  mild to moderate arterial hypertension, ramipril offers
  reliable antihypertensive efficacy in a once daily dose, thereby helping to
  improve patient compliance and making the treatment more economical.

do?....it changes kinetic energy to heat....HEAT...then to get going again I
gotta burn more (increasingly expensive) fuel.  With a Hybrid electric rig
it would seem possible to use regenerative braking ....storing some of that
energy gained from braking and reusing it to get started again.

My rig isn't all that quick to accelerate....0 to 60 in fifteen minutes is

You have put your finger on a salient point, Spike; such wild and unsupported accusations, made by a stranger, against someone who is not, cause one to wonder not if the accusations are true, but rather who such an accuser could be.  On the other hand, someone of such an ilk as that to which this accuser would seem to belong, simply because this person posted these accusations on a list run by the accused rather than forwarding them to the proper authorities for proper consideration, would probably view ALL publicity as positive.  Either this is the case, and this person is beneath either contempt or concern from us, or such an accusation was lobbed onto the list as a sociological exercise, to see (and perhaps write a report upon) how the list members would respond.  In either case, neither this person nor their accusations would seem to be worthy of even casual consideration, and I fully agree with their being stricken from the list.  We are also meme-savvy, and should not al!
low ourselves to be used in such a way.  If this person can be traced and their slander publicly pinned on them, I also support that action, if only to teach this person the existential lesson that actions entail consequences.

The problem here with hiring a lawyer is that it is unclear how to
ever establish a level of proof sufficient for a case in the law court.
So what if we identify the perp to the satisfaction of this list?
Would a jury be impressed?  I fear not.

This brings up yet another paradox presented by this medium.
Internet postings are the most evanescent form of communication,
just so many wispy electrons with no ink-on-paper tangeability.
Yet the actual permanence of these communications exceeds
the that of the most profound words chiseled into the most
durable stone.  spike

H. Keith Henson is mentioned in this post. It might be useful for everyone
here to note that Mr Henson has been an outspoken critic of Scientology,
and subject to harassment at their hands. In a 1998 trial brief

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
  FOR THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE

KENNETH HODEN,      Plaintiff,
  vs.
H. KEITH HENSON,      Defendant.
Case No. RIC 306884
Assigned for all purposes to Hon. Stephen D. Cunnison, Department 7

(to be found at http://www.lermanet.com/cos/hensonmotion.htm )

we read in the TRIAL BRIEF OF DEFENDANT that

< The gist of plaintiff's fallacious case is that defendant is a large,
drug-crazed, dangerous man with a history of violent, criminal and
murderous activity within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure ß
527.6(b).  Declaration of Kenneth Hoden, 3, 4 and 5, Declaration of
Kendrick L. Moxon, Exh., 1-15.  However, nothing could be further from the
truth as Exhibit A hereto evidences.  Mr. Henson had never been arrested
for any alleged Offense until he was targeted by Scientology's ferocious
litigation juggernaut.  The Church of Scientology, through its office of
Special Affairs ("OSA") has a long and documented history of abusing the
judicial system with vexatious and frivolous litigation for the purpose of
harassing and destroying its critics, even framing them.  This, and the
related cases, are merely further examples of this sordid anti- social
history. >

Curious, isn't it?

(I don't know what has transpired since that case.)

At best we could identify the account from which the post originated,
perhaps even the computer.  But it still would not provide courtroom
*proof* of which carbon unit made the post.

Here I am hoist on my own petard, for in the past I have intentionally
had friends and visitors post messages to extropians on my account
under my name, just to demonstrate complete deniability of any post.
Only now do I recognize the folly of doing this.  If discovered, the perp
could claim (s)he accidentally left the computer logged on and the
neighborhood kids posted the offending message.  That noise you hear
is our case being thrown out of court.  {8-[  spike

That surprises me.  A fire engine must be ready to make peak power within
seconds of being fired up, which I woulda thought incompatible with
warming up glow plugs and gallons of oil.  Thanks for the info, tho.
Now I wanna find out how a fire engine manages to do its thing.

You are too kind.  Im surprised it doesnt already exist.  I need to do
a search on the web.  Ill get back with you on that.

> I LOVE the idea of hybrid electric.

Me too, ever since I first learned how little power it takes to
cruise the average family car at freeway speeds and how much
expensive fuel is wasted sitting in traffic.

Especially a tranny capable of carrying the amount of torque
your rig makes.  That piece of equipment alone would be
(I think) heavier than the batteries needed for a hybid truck.

Well, two of em make heat.  Your Jacobs system converts money

Possible yes, even encouraged.

Again its because the trucker must churn thru all those gears.

Sure but electric motors would do the same, would they not?

Current ones will if you have access to liquid oxygen.  You can
be sure tho, smart guys are working like madmen trying to get

Yeah, I already looked it up, and it's blind at Deja. However you can do a

there are some others from this particular)

Somebody's just pushing some buttons, folks.

Kind of like the children that post on christian forums and yell "JESUS
RAPES CHILDREN" or something else very offensive to christians.

Not that Max is Jesus.

The only negative possibility I see here is if some overambitious legal
enforcement person decides to investigate Max.  That would suck.  Then
again, what's to keep some of our "enemies" from copying all of our names
and smearing such lies all over the internet?  Not much.

Perhaps there's some scriptkiddies/crackers/punks reading this who will
track down our accusing friend and send him some "love."

Hey, this gives me an idea.  We have gone on and oooonnnn about
transparency, have we not?  Well here we go, this is where the rubber
meets the road.  We have a use now, a job for those who are willing
to have every aspect of their lives open to the brightest light of day.
Meeeeeeee!  Im willing!  Im happy to let someone, encourage someone
to burn their resources investigating the hell out of every aspect of my
life.

Finally!  I recognize a possible use for having a totally G-rated life
{tho not necessarily by choice always...  {8^D}  I and other
extropian info-nudists can form a smoke-screen for those who
prefer a more private life.  Anyone who wants to can hire an
army of private investigators to watch me around the clock.
Id be better than sominex.

I am willing to have opened every medical record, every tax return,
every bank account, every traffic or arrest record {I have 5 speeding
tickets, 4 of which were from overenthusiastic enjoyment of
motorcycles}, every internet post I ever made, anything else anyone
wants to know, honest to god, I volunteer *Everything*.

How can this be used?  spike

I don't know if it's the same but, I think so, Jim said he saw him at the
Future Foundations meeting, and that he is a major key to the genomic jazz.
I discovered this in text:
Dr. Gregory Stock, trained in biophysics and business, is the director of
UCLA's Program on Medicine, Technology, and Society. Greg emphasizes three
important vectors of change: genetic engineering, artificial intelligence,
and space travel.

So I checked out the ucla site and found:
http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/pmts/Stock.htm
And : http://www.ess.ucla.edu/huge/gregory.html

I didn't see anything about the anti-aging company, but there is an email:
gstock@ess.ucla.edu
And he has done interviews with the like of Dr. Marvin Minsky about such
topics as "How Does Technology Transform Society?".

You might be right, but the best test of this, since we can't plumb the
minds of all the actors yet, I think, is if the war is purely defensive.
Granted, not all nations on the defensive are fighting a just war, but it
would seem more likely, a nation fighting in defense is one that has been
attacked.  Prima facie, that would make it look like a just war -- for it
not its attacker.

However, this does bring up the issue of leading attackers on (which some
believe the US government did with the Japanese Empire in 1941) and also of
preemptive strikes (e.g., the Six Day War).  On the former, to me, attacks
always given the odor of being unjust and wrong, though one must dig deeper
and make reasonable conclusions.  Did the American government expect an
attack?  Did it do anything to lead the Japanese government on?  Was that
the most likely outcome of its policies?  Did the people in charge know
this?  If they did not, should they have?  All of these are enough to fill a
book and I'm not a scholar of World War Two.  I'm only using it to
illustrate this problem here.

Regarding the latter, I lean very strongly against the attacker, even if the
attacker is a democracy with much more freedoms than it adversaries, as in
the Six Day War.  (Strange thing is a lot of democracies seem to be very
militaristic on the whole.  Examples include, the US, UK, France, India, and
Israel.  Yeah, there are plenty of counterexamples, but the Kantian
democracy brings peace argument has to come to grips with all the data,
especially since the ones I list are some of the most democratic nations in
their regions or have a long history of democracy.)

I checked out this "wonderful homepage". Curiously, enough, their reading of 
the Hebrew Calander is inaccurate. It will be the year, 5761, I believe, not 
7000. So the "messiah's" return is off by a bit. Seems the Southern Baptists 
and the Assemblies of God who fund missionary movements to "non-believers" 
might prove better to fund money for the deserving poor.

...Or even moving somewhere else with a fair bit of stuff is a very
cleansing experience ...! (me: moving to another country two
years ago, next week moving to another city, both with my small
library in tow). Yes, Highly recommended.

The Sufis have an intriguing idea of getting rid of baggage (material
or psychological) *continually*, so that one is always killing a part
of oneself off, i.e. "making a space".  A space to think and to be and
to be open to new elements in one's life.

I see Eli's name quest as a fundamental quest for putting a label
on one's identity. It's something that every human everywhere must
come to terms with, yes? (Unless you choose to be not part of any
society and be Nameless), So then, these sorts of questions
arise in a name change:

    * What parts of myself do I want to reveal to the world?
    * What parts do I wish to keep private?
    (both of these are about what masks, if any, to wear)
    * What is unique about me, that I wish to show?
    * What are my strengths?
    * How do I view myself presently?
    * How do I see myself in the future?

Mostly, since the oddities nudge people in remembering me.

Which depends on the context, right?

I receive random pieces of mail in  my  postal mailbox addressed
to "Herrn" Graps, instead of "Frau" Graps, but that mail goes
into the trash anyway.

On the Internet, The gender confusion can work as a good filter,
because usually strangers that write me want some assistance with
something. I figure if the person wanting my help and addressing
me as "Mr." isn't spending the 30 seconds to learn my gender,
then their requests are usually not worth my time to which to
respond, anyway.

In my career, I much prefer that the random stranger get my
gender right, because the number of women in astronomy is much
less than the number of men (and 100 times less in Germany than
in the US), and, since I'm a noncompetititve person, and
I have other things working against me in science (I'm a
generalist rather than a specialist, I'm older, and my career
path has been unusual), then my name and gender gives me
something distinctive that is helpful.

I think that the people on this list are special- many are
following nontraditional paths, thinking unusual things, so
the name-label, i.e., the way that each chooses to show their
face to other humans, then involves a process to figure out
how to put a label on their natural ways of being.

Now Eli was talking about wanting to put some distance between
himself now, and some posts that he wrote some years ago to the
Internet that he'd rather not be identified with.

I have some bad news for you Eli-

**** The Internet is a strange, very large, sometimes wonderful,
sometimes tragic beast, that WON'T FORGET what you wrote, no matter
when you wrote it, and no matter what name under which you wrote it.
It WILL REMEMBER you, and sometimes it will shape you into a
different lifeform.  ****

The following is my very strangest Internet-name experience.

Three years ago, a woman at a department at the Carolinas HealthCare
System in Charlotte, NC, wrote me, in quest of some background information
for a quotation that the Vice President made in a presentation. The V.P.
found the quotation in material he had from his previous job at
a management consultant company: Ernest and Young.

The women told me that the quotation is called "Amara's Law":

"In reacting to change, there is a tendency to overestimate the
impact of change in the short run and underestimate its long term impact."

I thought: HOLY-MOLEY!! (as Batman says). This quotation was taken
from a post I made to the sci.physics Usenet group 1 1/2 years earlier,
about the "Physics of Traffic Flows", where I said:

"One rule-of-thumb in responding to any stimulus that one does not want to
become unstable is: the longer one waits in response to a stimulus, the
strength of that response should be exponentially less with respect to
that time."

(which was paraphrasing my old physics prof, Dr. Elliot Montroll,
at UC Irvine)

So my Usenet post surfaces in a slightly different way as "Amara's Law"
in a management department in a health care company in South Carolina?!!
(EEEK)

I gave the woman my post that began the whole
thing,(http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/traffic.txt), I asked her
to please get the attribution right (to Elliot Montroll), and
then I asked myself whether it was time to quit Usenet.


So you see Eli, Real Life is Stranger than Fiction.


Amara

Gee Spike, isn't handwriting admissable as evidence?  Wasn't it you who mentioned the availability of pattern recognition software usable on text files?  With a fairly substantial test run would anyone be able to demonstrate the reliability of such pattern recognition software enough to clearly show that even though anyone could have used that particular machine and account they could not have so exactly duplicated style of some named individual?  Is that doable?

I would like to continue this particular discussion under a different thread (such as "author identifiability").  I would think that this is an important issue given the points that you have brought up.

I just logged back on after a day away from the net and saw this crap.  For 
the record, and for those who don't know him personally, I'll state in the 
strongest possible terms that it is unthinkable to me that Max More could be 
accused of such a thing.  I would testify as a character witness for Max in 
any court in the galaxy.

I do not know Keith Henson as well as I know Max, but I know he's been a 
courageous fighter for truth - and has made enemies among weak and 
small-minded people in the process.  As others have, I can therefore only 
conclude that this was just an example of the kind of evil Keith has staked 
his life against.

Interesting piece in the NY Times (Aug 20 2000) about how easy
wealth derived from oil (40 cent/gallon gas!) is ruining the
economy and creating a situation where politicians will fall
(and people will probably die in the unrest) when "normalization"
occurs.

[I suppose this could be useful for lesbians and bisexuals as well...]

A friend of mine sent me a scanned image of the following newspaper
clipping.  Unfortunately there's no reference on the scan, so I don't
know where it's from.  But I think it's worth a laugh --- or at least
it's a justification for the habits of dirty old men.  :-)

    AN EYEFUL A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY
    ------------------------------------- by Jonathan Hayter

    Staring at women's breasts is good for men's health and makes them
    live longer, a new survey reveals.  Researchers have discovered
    that a 10-minute ogle at women's breasts is as healthy as a
    30-minute workout in the gym.  A five-year study of 200 men found
    that those who enjoyed a longing look at busty beauties had lower
    blood pressure, less heart disease and slower pulse rates compared
    to those who did not get their daily eyeful.

    Dr. Karen Weatherby, who carried out the German study, wrote in the
    New England Journal of Medicine: "Just 10 minutes of staring at the
    charms of a well-endowed female is roughly equivalent to a
    30-minute aerobics workout.  Sexual excitement gets the heart
    pumping and improves blood cicrulation.  Our study indicates that
    engaging in this activity for a few minutes daily cuts the risk of
    stroke an heart attack in half.  We believe that by doing so
    consistently, the average man can extend his life for four to five
    years."

    She added that sexy stars like Dolly Parton, Heather Locklear, Anna
    Nicole Smith, and Demi Moore had proved to be especially good for
    men's health.

Of course, they don't mention what *else* the guys are doing while
they're staring.  I would suspect that they might need their hands
free for, um, manual labour, shall we say.

In an interesting academic tour de force, John Cummings, A. Zettl and
Philip G. Collins from Berkeley and LBNL have managed to spin their
work to get simultaneous publications in Science *and* Nature.
(I cannot recall having ever seen this previously).

In Science:
 "Low-Friction Nanoscale Linear Bearing Realized from Multiwall Carbon
 Nanotubes", Science 289(5479):602-604 (28 Jul 2000).
 URL: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5479/602

In Nature:
 "Materials: Peeling and sharpening multiwall nanotubes"
  Nature 406(6796):586 (10 Aug 2000).
  URL: http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v406/n6796/full/406586a0_fs.html

The Nature article is more interesting for me because it seems to
suggest that sharpened (few or single-wall) nanotube tips may be produced
using automated sensing procedures and subjected to quality control using
electron microscopy and pattern matching.

The bottom line would appear to be that there is a clear path to the
volume production of atomically precise AFM tips, implying that
parallel or array read/write AFMs should be feasible.

Makes you want to ask -- "What is the sound of one shoe dropping?"

Also worth noting is the fact that the journals involved must *want*
to publish articles in these areas which bodes well for scientists
working in these areas.

I keep thinking I have strayed out from Extropy list into the pagan/magick
E-lists that I belong to!
It is a constant theme to discuss magickal names and the criterion of
choosing them amongst the occult frats/ sors.... no doubt for very deep
mystical and psychological reasons..... and I did read somewhere that
mono-names (sting, Madonna &c) do work better as stage-names than longer
ones.

Even an adopted label (Extropian, Wiccan or whatever) suffixed to your name
alters your whole persona (how others think of you)  ... our names are part
of our total package, and I suppose if we are proactive regards changing
world-scale evolution, then changing our own names is but a small thing.

I have researched and published an article on "He-names" and power
adjectives in names from both a folk-lore and psychological perspective, and
it does seem that indeed "the name is the thing" in some very concrete ways.

I never made the connection to the Amara on this list.

Are you sure that you're the Amara it's attributed to?  Granted, "Amara"
is not the most common of names, but it could have been put out by
another Amara.

It is, but such evidence is good enough to convince *us* and to find
truth for practical purposes.  The level of proof required for a court

Hmmm, probably not.  At least not for court case evidence.  The text
pattern recognition is really good for figuring out if an author used a
ghost writer, etc, but recall a game we were playing last April Fools
Day where I suggested we parody each other and post under each
other's names etc.  A few did so, and wrote parodies of me.  At least
one of these, Damien's, was not only a very good parody, it was
hilarious.  My point here is that if someone wanted to claim non-authorship,
I dont see how we could prove otherwise in court, ever.  The perp
could always claim someone studied the vocabulary, writing style,
and wrote an intentional look-alike.

Nowthen, my text analysis software really needs a *lot* of text, and
I suspect our bomb thrower yesterday was a one-time hit and run.
I have more thoughts on this but gotta go to work.

I vaguely recall that it was 160, or possibly 120, during the time of
the Second Temple.

The Jews know about this, BTW - maybe not *all* the Jews, but it's an
acknowledged fact among those who've heard of it.  The author of the
original "Seder Olam" (the calendar calculations) knew that he'd lost
track, so he operated on the assumption that the reign of any given king
is only as long as the last year mentioned in the documentation; e.g.,
if the only thing said about a given kind is that he raised taxes during
the third year, it's assumed that he reigned for three years.  In modern
times, I think, they went back and refigured the times with the
assistance of archaelogy and other nations' calendars.  With that gap
covered, there's a complete, calculable timeline from the creation of
the Universe around 59xx years ago to modern times.  (I know it's not
5980 or 5990, because I once figured the actual calendar and was amused
that the controversial - according to some, theologically prohibited -
prediction that the world will end in 6000 is actually going to be off
by at least a few decades.)

And despite all of the above, most Orthodox (but non-Ultra-Orthodox
Jews) are perfectly aware that the Universe is fifteen billion years
old.  And, while claiming to see no dissonance between the two, they
will simultaneously attend seminars on how to reconcile the two numbers.

The creation of bad states -- "really predatory criminal states" -- does not
happen in a vacuum.  Freedom does not, per se, encourage it.  For example,
the US government, during the 1920s, helped to back German inflationary
policies leading to the rise of the Nazis.  During the 1930s, the US
government sent grain shipments to the USSR, helping to keep Stalin in
power.  During the Cold War, the US helped to back many dictatorships, even
by overthrowing many democratic governments and replacing them with military
dictatorships.  (Democracies are not always nice, but in almost all of these
instances, from Guetamala to South Vietnam, the government which took over,
while loyal to the US, was much worse than what came before.)  Notice a
pattern?

If not, recently, the US government has supported both Indonesia and Turkey,
despite the fact that both nations have severely repressed ethnic minorities
and continue to do so.  (Happily, Indonesia is starting to come apart, but
the US government kept supporting its government with money and arms sales
during the bloodily repressed secession of East Timor.)  The pattern
continues.

I'm not even going to go over all the little interventions throughout the
early twentieth century in Latin America that helped to set the chessboard
of current instability.  (Helped but did not create, since a lot of Latin
America's problems are due to the disintegration of the Spanish Empire and
internal repressions.  The US government helped a lot of these repressions
out, in the name of American businesses or fighting Communism.)

My point here is that if the US had practices a foreign policy less
interventionist, less statist, a lot of these problems would have not
happened.  Or if they had happened, they would have been less severe.  Also,
US involvement did not make things better.  To boot, Americans have died in
the process.

You speak as if the US had been some sort of libertarian society all along
and all these bad states arose, then far sighted politicians in Washington,
D.C. saw that they must reject libertarian noninterventionism in favor of
getting involved.

In the case of Saudi Arabia, oil wealth alone has given that nation a
"vacation from politics."  The government there is able to take people's
minds off everything else by giving out cash.  (Most of this is expropriated
since the oil industry there was nationalized.  In other words, the Saud
government stole what someone else built.)  Falling oil prices and the
winding down of the Cold War actually led in the 1990s to the rise of many
internal militant groups aimed at overthrowing the Saudi government.  (The
Riyadh terrorist attack in 1995 is one example.  See
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/saudi_blast/11am/index.html)

In the case of Chile, Pinochet eventually did fall from power and the
country is much better off now.  The reason he adapted many pro-market
policies which have laid the foundation for current political stability is
that he alienated both the USSR and the US, so he had to go it alone.  This
pragmatic decision did help to create a stronger populace that was later
able to call for Pinochet's giving up power in the 1990s.  He did this
reluctantly, but he did it.  (Not to defend him, but his government was much
less repressive than Argentina's Junta run one of the 1980s and Fujimura's
Peru then and now.  Perhaps this is because there was less economic
repression.  If you can't start a business or invest money unless you have
friends in power, then consider yourself economically repressed.)

Also, your statements overlook two other things.  One, I do not base my
defense of libertarianism on capitalism.  You can reread my posts.  We were
talking about US and NATO interventions, not economics.  Aside from that my
claim was that societies that have freedom tend to be the more prosperous
ones -- not vice versa.

Two, the weight of examples are on the side of those who argue the economic
freedom and political freedom intersect.  The Soviet Union and its puppets
fell because of its people saw they could be better off without communism.
Not one has gone back, despite years of pundits telling us everyone over
there wants to.  The Peoples' Republic of China, similarly, is going through
this process right now, albeit more slowly.  The other "fossil regimes" --
Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba -- have yet to embrace free market policies,
though Vietnam is trying to do this, but fears this might threaten its rule.
(Why would the rulers there be afraid if there wasn't some link between
political and economic freedom?)

Funny, though you are admitting to be intellectually dependent here.  I tend
to think these guys have great ideas in limited areas.  I would not think
that because someone is intelligent or creative in one area that that makes
her or him intelligent or creative in all areas.  This is the mistake many
people make vis-a-vis other people.  Einstein was a very intelligent and
creative physicist (he had his limits that too, but you have to give him
credit for his outstanding successes too), but a sloppy and highly
derivative political thinker.

I hope you and he are right.:)  Until then, I'm not going to base my support
or lack thereof for certain policies on a conceiveable, especially when
people are being killed by such policies right now.  In other words, it's
nice to dream about the future, but we have to deal with the present.

Arthur C. Clarke stated something related to this, Amara, when
I was still in diapers and you were yet unborn.  His comment was
on predicting the future: that futurologists overestimate how different
the world will be 5 years from now and vastly underestimate how
different it will be in 50, something like that.

Since all my archives exist in only the crippleware version {ink on
dead trees} searching out the quote is a daunting task.  I fondly
anticipate the day when we work out a new way to pay content
creators, freeing ourselves of the antiquated system which clearly
already fraying at the edges, allowing us to archive all our knowledge
in such a way that it can be effectively searched.

I would cherrfully refer to your quote as Amara C. Clark's law...

Perhaps it wasn't Greg Stock, but I could *swear* somebody at Extro4 was 
starting a company that does baseline measurements of hormone levels and then
attempts to slow down aging by maintaining the customer's hormones at those
baseline levels as ve ages.

I did a deja.com search for the senders address
(jamiro2002@my-deja.com) and found these posts:

http://www.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=659502817&fmt=text

This bit from on of the headers:

" X-Http-Proxy: 1.0 x69.deja.com:80 (Squid/1.1.22) for client 199.108.50.36 "

suggests the IP address "199.108.50.36" is the sender's server.

This page http://www.osilab.ch/dns_e.htm shows that server to be
"los-feliz.lapl.org" which is a Los Angeles Public Library server.
I'd contact the LAPL and find out what it takes to get an account
with them and what it takes for someone using their server to get
a my-deja.com address via an account with the LA library.

Here's a clue to this mystery:

Excerpt from http://www.byte.com/column/BYT19990928S0001

The Internet, in my view, is pre-eminent because it has the potential to
subsume all the preceding information and communications technologies. The
hard part is figuring out when and to what degree. I'm reminded of Amara's
law, postulated by Roy Amara, a colleague who was president of The Institute
for the Future: "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the
short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."

I have been scouring thru my collection of Arthur C. Clarke works.  I
*think* the quotation is from "Profiles of the Future", a remarkable
volume Clarke wrote between 1958 and 1961.  I cannot locate the
exact quote, but all extropians who have not reviewed this profound
book of technoprophecy should drop whatever they are doing and read it.

Clarke saw further and more clearly into the future than any of his
contemporaries, anticipating many of the topics we talk about here,
including transparent society notions, advanced manufacturing and
the resulting prosperity, nanotechnology (well, kinda sorta, chapter
15 the Road to Lilliput), and even human immortality.  Broderick's
The Spike is like a Y2K version of Clarke's Profiles.  Do read both.

Spike C. Clarke's law:  Any sufficiently Arthur C. Clarke-like
person is indistinguishable from god.  {8^D  spike

IAN: Sorry, I thought those would work. The other
way is to enter the address (jamiro2002@my-deja.com)
in the "author" box at the dejanews.com power search:

http://www.dejanews.com/home_ps.shtml

The person could remove them, so save them.

Chris Heward spoke about this idea back at Extro-1 and Extro-2, and it has 
recently become the Kronos Group, based in Arizona, but with clinics 
planned to open in many cities. The program involves a full day of testing 
of numerous physiological functions, and then carefully personalized 
recommendations. They do not want to be described as a "life extension" 
group, but as involved in "age management". Natasha and I will be going 
through the program next month. They will do a follow-up in six months, and 
then I think once a year. I'll be happy to report on my experience there in 
about a month.

Their web site is:

Onward!

If it is like the Houston Public library, you can just walk up and get on 
the Internet. No ID required.
I myself have posted in just such a manner. It is *truly* anonymous posting, 
save for possible security cameras.

Given that the poster went to such measures (he appeared to be literate 
enough to afford a computer), we might reasonably guess that he knows Max 
More, and vice versa. Perhaps he is a well-known enemy.

We here have ways a person can access the internet from the
public library without a scrap of personal identification.  So
lets go ahead and recognize that the current level of our
society's opacity allows people to post on the internet
without the slightest fear of repercussions.

Let us look at how such a situation could be used as a
political tool or weapon.  Suppose someone hated both the
extropians and posthumanists, for instance, and wanted
to see both groups vitiated.  This could be accomplished
by getting each to use up their energies and creativity trying
to tear down the other.  This would create a most pleasing
and amusing situation to political opponents, would it not?

I can imagine any number of groups that would try to
accomplish something like this by tossing a meme-bomb such
as yesterday's misadventure:  fundy christian groups,
scientologists, ultragreen terrorists, etc.

Allow me to add my support to those who have suggested
filtering posts from any anonymous remailer.  This would
filter out the meme-bombing while still allowing newbies,
outsiders and non-members to post.  I suppose it is another
step towards greater transparency, but of course Ive no
problem with that.  {8^D  spike

IAN: The person seems to be newly acquainted with and examining
the meme theory. I believe that to get the my-deja.com address
the person used, they have to have a fixed email address to
which a confirmation is sent like is the case for subscribing
to this list. If so, I'd assume they'd have to have an email
account with the library, which means they might be known. ??

Actually, the latent heat of planet formation seems to still be
the driver for most of the gas giants (esp. Jupiter).  The insulating
layer accumulates relatively fast and the gradual gravitational
contraction produces heat that only slowly escapes.  There is
also a fair amount of radioactive material gradually decaying.

I don't think the equations of state are well enough understood
to predict how much heat should be produced by these effects
and the rates at which they should escape through the overlying
material.  For example, we can barely make solid-metallic hydrogen,
and can't yet measure such properties as electrical or heat conductivity
effectively).  I think the jury is still out on whether Mars does
or does not have a liquid core.  And Mars is relatively easy compared
with the gas giants.

But, I would agree the EvMick's quote of Venus radiating 40x its solar
input is higher than anything I've ever seen.  Its albedo is very
high, reflecting away much of its incoming light.  The high
CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is required to create the
very high surface temperatures.  Unless someone is running a
large number of nuclear reactors on the surface, the 40x figure
is dubious.

Excuse me?

Also, I still kind of wonder what fundamental aspects of existence can be
explained solely by the use of memes (which admittedly was not a point you

Sounds good. I just can't seem to see anything that can not be explained by
common sense or existing concepts, but can be explained by memes. Can you
suggest some?

That seems sort of obvious. If you define real as agreed upon and thereby
experienced, sure, anything can be real. Of course I would then have to
question the value of such a reality as basis for mutual interaction. I am
not saying the implications in the case of the meme would be tremendous,
since you in fact mostly label an obvious occurence with a fancy word.
Expanding your philosophy of "real is what is defined as real" and "anything
that can be imitated is real" however quickly borders ad absurdum.

Since you bring it up - and I have no idea if your post reflects the
sentiments of the people discussing here, though I doubt it: The two
(factualness of the meme and lack of intelligence of our culture) might be
connected. Introducing false or unnecessary concepts into common think would
make a culture more stupid, would it not?

I have been a lurker here for a while and have studied up a bit on memes.

The most striking observation I am forced to make, and to which I would
welcome your input, is that there is no proof for memes. In fact, it seems
like somebody took the obvious (ideas and concept travel by means of
communication from one person to another, whereby speed, accuracy and life
expectancy of the recepient's new concept may vary) and dreamed up a fancy
and quite unnecessary name for it. Hence the meme.

I don't mean to sound overly critical, but I have so far failed to observe
major advantages to this uproven theory.

I used the handwriting example to bring up the point that there are many ways to identify individuals that, while not nearly as "certain" as DNA testing are reliable enough for use as evidence in a Court of Law.  How much text would be required to state that duplication of style would be say 1:1000 chance?  Could even that level of assurance be accomplished?

I would not argue that we ought to use text analysis as stand-alone evidence.  Though if reliable enough then it could certainly tip the scales in the preponderance of evidence. 

 Example:
 we have the address from which an offending post was allegedly sent. 
 The audit logs from that computer also show that the appropriate e-mail account was in fact accessed from that machine, and that account is password protected.
  The Audit logs also show that a secure connection was created to amazon.com, and that several other message boards to which the owner of the account regularly posts were also accessed and some of them posted too.
  A supboena of records from amazon show that a book was ordered using a credit card held by the owner of the e-mail account and sent to that persons address. etc.
  Library cameras show that person to have been in the library at the appropriate time, and a book was checked out using his library account.
  The individual in question says that he went to the bathroom and when he returned he found that he had not logged out of his e-mail.(Plenty of time for someone else to post under his name)  To which textual analysis shows that the post in question is so similar to his style that it would be unlikely that anyone could duplicate it without hours of study.  case proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Even if it were only reliable enough to legally subpoena other data then it would still be a valuable tool.

You're right Robert, that Nature article is pretty damn neat. Multiwall nanotubes
are ideal for AFT tips, they're incredibly tough, if bent almost to a right angle they
spring right back with no damage done, and they're sensitive, just a small deflection
on a multiwall nanotubes causes a big change in electrical resistance. That  last
property is great for sensing but no so great if you want to use them as a wire
interconnecting the components of a nanocomputer. And wires are important now
that we already have molecular switches. There is some indication that single
walled nanotubes would work better as a wire than the multiwalled variety, I hope so,
but if not all is not lost, we can always use a array of quantum dots.

I personally think we should keep the entire conversation intact, as is.  We

Good question.  There were some intruiguing stylistic points in the offending
text, such as lions having pups, etc.  The others I will not post, for they may
be useful in case the same poster hits again under a different name.

Hmmm.  I guess it depends on if the case is tried in criminal court
or civil.

Ja, but I need to explain what my software does.  The user reads in
a bunch of text, then software graphs a blip each time a new word
is used.  If you have a book written all by the same person, there is
a lot of new words up front (all of them in fact), then the appearance
of new words gets exponentially less frequent.  If a new author's text
is appended, a cluster of new words shows up.  Its really a pretty
simple minded program.

I was in theology school when I wrote this.  My class mates were
enthralled, as computers had seen little use in that field.  The
software cares not which language is used, so we loaded the
Hebrew Pentateuch, and were able to see why the common
theory is that the first five books of the bible were probably
written by at least 4 authors.

Nowthen, the real clues are more stylistic, and even with
advanced tools, there is plenty of guesswork and opinion.
Even today, there is lively debate over whether all the works
attributed to Shakespeare were his, or do they include some
work by Francis Bacon, et al.

Of course, if we have all that other evidence you sited, we
could make a damn strong case.  I was not aware that
libraries had cameras, but if they did I would step up to
the plate with literary and stylistic analysis.  Now, for such
a tiny piece of text, one page, we neednt use the software,
which would likely be useless for that anyway, but compare
the offending text with the other four posts by you-know-who.
It is clear enough it is the same person.

Nowthen, no one has mentioned the fact that if we attempted
either a criminal case or civil lawsuit on the basis of internet
slander, we are plowing new legal ground.  Legals, is this
correct?  I know of no one who has successfully prosecuted
for internet slander, even tho I have seen posted many
things that would be illegal pretty much in any other medium.
We might be setting ourselves up for an expensive case
that would go nowhere anyway.  Of course I could be
wrong.  I hope Greg Burch offers an opinion here.

John, The fact that spam is still legal and so many obvious con
games are being fearlessly played out on the internet makes
me think the chances of prosecution are slim.  Nowthen, if
we had solid evidence, such as recorded video of a perp
slinking into the library, doing the classic Snidely Whiplash look-
both-ways- and nyah-ah-ahhhh etc, with time stamps and
traceability to that terminal etc, making a slanderous post,
then we have a hell of a case.  But I honestly feel literary
style analysis will not get us there, either in criminal or
civil court.  Furthermore, I suspect we will hear nothing
more from you-know-who, but will ever have this ugly
incident as the electronic version of a drive-by shooting.
These are some important and intriguing questions you
raise however.

No. Get rid of it. Now.

The Internet has search engines which can call up a name and an archive -- BY 
SUBJECT. We wouldn't want this to pop up by someone doing research on this 
topic. The lies shouldn't be allowed to stand, because someone might use them 
someday later to their own purpose. Whoever the sick bastard is.

Actually, the lie is not as innocuous as it seems - posts can be quoted 
without being researched. Here's how come I know this: 

One day I had the odd surprise of being told "You're in Mensa's magazine." 

Yep, that's right, anti-intellectual Queene. Naah.... but they showed me it. 

Some chick was writing and article about Sex and Intelligence. She must have 
done a search for those two words, and Bingo: Some quip I tossed off one late 
night probably, and had no memory of writing. Never aware they had a 
publication. 

She listed QueeneMUSE from the ExI forum as a source *in her article* 
(without my permission). I have no qualifications to speak about the subject, 
but this seemed to make no difference to the readers or the writer.

I am sure this has happened to many of you.

If this can be done so casually - please, let's not let this fake "fact" 
appear in any of our archives. It could only be harmful, not informative.

    I have already given Max the info. The Loz-feliz library has a policy 
that anyone using their public workstations must provide ID (library card or 
drivers licence). Their personal details are logged. Users can only have 30 
minute sessions and the time is recorded against the user. so jamiro is as 
good as found. That is if the library has been following policy.
    I dont want to stay on this subject any more but I will say that I think 
the post should not be removed from the archive. If we censor our posts, we 
are hiding from the enemy.
    If I were the target for such an attack I would feel the same way. 
Unfortunatly Jamiro has a right to voice his/her opinion however unfounded or 
morally outragous. Jamiro must also face the consiquences of their actions. 
If the post was omited from the archives it would just lend credance to the 
allegations and could be misconstrued as an attempt to hide the truth.

    I tested deja to see how easy it is to get an account. It took less than 
2 mins to set up and although you need to supply an email address, This is 
not used as part of the sign up process. Your new username and password 
become active imediatley.
    I cheked Jamiro's profile and "what a suprise" it was empty. Incidently 
jamiro has only been posting on alt.memetics since 11/8/00. but since then 
has posted on the 13/14/17/18 of aug. It looks like the account was only set 
up a week or so ago.

True.  I think given the low magnetic activity though, we can guess which

I doubt the figure too, though the surface rock is almost at a liquid state.
In fact, some believe that Venus goes through a cycle of complete meltdowns
where the crust and mantle are mixed.  The cycle length is estimated to be
about half a billion years based on the lack of surface features that seem
older than that.

So, perhaps heath from Venus' innards makes it out much more quickly than
Earth's.

IANAL, but Jamiro doesn't have a right to slander. Not all unfounded

If you're new here, you probably wonder what this is all about. There is
a website called www.parishioners.org that treads a very fine line
bordering on libel. Scientology denies any connection with this site,
but curiously the site has responded to certain court orders given to
the cult as a whole by removing pages from the site.

In case you're wondering, Dotty here is a scientologist, and is quoting
the site's libellous accusations against Mr. Henson, a critic of the
cult. This is a feeble attempt to discredit him, and not very effective.
If you check out the site, you'll note there is no hard evidence, just
innuendo.

I suspect these creatures have now found the extropes.

A question regarding this.....

If solid-metallic hydrogen IS constructed...is it then stable under various
conditions?  That is....could it exist at "room temp/pressure"....or would
it require the horrendous pressures of a gas giant ?


Regarding planetary energy production.   Let's see if i got this right.

Earth has a liquid core....the REASON it does is that it has a large
moon....the moon acts as a brake on earths rotation which causes
heat....(that plus radioactive decay)...this heats up the core and provides
for all kindsa cool things like continental plates and probably life...

Is that right?

It melts then boils at a few degrees kelvin, even at tremendous pressure.

I tried to resist, but I just have to put my 2 cents worth in here.

Keith Henson, in the short time I knew him personally back in California,
showed himself to be a fine man with a fine mind. Probably still is,
although I haven't seen him in recent years.

So I did a quick google search and found that the allegations against him
originated on a website for Scientology (an organization that claims it is a
religion while it behaves like a criminal gang). This Scientologist site
claims to be in favor of religious tolerance, while practicing the most
vicious intolerance imaginable.

Now I suppose that my name is on their hit list. Well, if a person is known
by his enemies (as well as by his friends), then I would consider it an
honor to have Scientology mad at me.

Regards,

Michael LaTorra

I don't know as much about Scientology as Michael and the others.  In fact,
I've had little contact with Scientologists over the years.  I've only
skimmed _Dianetics_ and have too much else to read to devote any time to it.
But I do know that hypocrisy is rampant everywhere and in just about all
times.  Thus, it would not surprise me if a person or a group claims to be
tolerant, yet is actually extremely intolerant.

>From my involvement with the Objectivist movement, I've seen this, sadly, to
be true of too many Objectivists -- not to mention quite a number of them
also being dependent, conformist thinkers on many issues.  (This is not to
single them out.  I've met others who pride themselves on independent
thought who also suffer the same flaws.)

Cheers!

deja is an email server that does not verify the identities of its
users, which the poster probably knew. However, if it is possible, I'll
put up $100.00 to whoever comes up with the identity of the bastard. My
personal suspicion is that its one of our old friends that we had a
little trouble with some time ago who made other accusations of Max. Its
the same MO, likely the same perpetrator.

I'd put up $1000. Ok so that is $1100 so far, who else will contribute?
Let's make a stand here, and try to make an example of this criminal.

If we can figure out a way to do something when we actually have this
person's name, there's $100 from me as well.  Let's not lynch, but do it
the right way.

That would be in keeping with their history.  Trinity is the product of the 
same people that did the Video Toaster - or half of them, anyway, as NewTek 
split up and the one's that left created Play and Trinity.  When the 
original Toaster was in development, for years these guys would show up and 
demo Betas at shows, and then, finally, it was ready to ship and they 
reportedly had 15,000 orders awaiting shipment.

So, in the middle of the night, days before shipment of the first actual 
orders, one of the two major geniuses behind the Toaster calls the other one 
up to tell him that he just had a flash on how they could put the entire 
Toaster on one board instead of two and get a whole huge increase in 
capability at the same time.

Naturally, they cancelled all the orders and went back to the drawing board, 
and two years later the new single-board Toaster took over the market and 
literally forced digital editing/post production prices down by two orders 
of magnitude - making Babylon 5 possible, as one result.

Which way is that? The consequences of the one I'm thinking of would
require a lot more than $1200. ;)

The thing with the perp is that he likely doesn't have two bits to his
name, so going after him in court would be a waste, though if he truly
is in school, then ruining his academic career would be nice and
rewarding. Perhaps the perp is a former student of Max's? Perhaps
someone who has been rather virulent about getting a bad grade from Max?

Lets not jump to conclusions however.  Have we any writing samples
from that distasteful affair?  Recall that the trouble which refer to
was from (I think?) a posthuman group.  It would be tragic indeed if
extropians and posthumans could not work together.  Our philosophies
are very similar, and likely approximately equally disturbing to any

I so sympathize.  Back in the '70's, I put on an income tax demonstration at 
3rd and Long Beach Blvd., on April 15th, in front of the post office and the 
bank next door.  A week later, the Long Beach PD had me arrested for 
"Loitering With Children," 653G CA Penal Code.  This is one of those 
open-ended codes originally designed to go after drug dealers at 
high-schools.  As with other loitering laws, it has been repeatedly amended 
by court decision, and they utterly failed to meet the requirements of the 
law.  Their "evidence" was that I had been seen in Ocean Park taking 
pictures when children were present.

Nevertheless, they pursued my conviction for about a year, costing me about 
$50,000 all told, I estimate and thouroughly trashing my reputation in local 
libertarian circles, where the rumor was spread that I was a child-molestor, 
although no children were ever named as victims and no allegations of any 
such acts were ever made by the police.  I had been giving workshops on 
children's rights at the Future of Freedom conferences, of which I was a 
major organizer.  The FoFCon con committee barred me from further 
participation.

After a year, the court dismissed all charges and the court record, signed 
by the judge, reads "defendant exonerated."  I.e., the court went beyond 
just saying that no conviction was possible to a positive statement that I 
was in fact innocent.  Nonetheless, I STILL - over 20 YEARS later - 
occasionally run into someone in the libertarian movement who has heard that 
I am a child-molestor.

In at least one case a real child molestor - Tim Kuklinsky - who I 
identified as using the local libertarian movement as his feeding ground, 
and who, at last notice, was serving an indefinite sentence in the mental 
division of one of the state's penal facilities, used attacks on me in this 
light to cover his own predation.

This is not fun.  I would hope that extropians would be a little less likely 
to jump to any suspicions based on anonymous allegations.

I'm assuming that this person did not try to contact you directly first to 
ask you about these alleged allegations.

Wait, slooooow down Hoss.  Recall the original post mentioned Keith
Henson.  Why would one of Max's disgruntled former students do that?
Keith scarcely ever posts to extropians, maybe half a dozen times in
the 3 yrs Ive been reading it daily.  How would a former student of
Max even know Keith?  If Max were the primary target, why wouldnt
the perp have taken a swipe at one of the other prominent extropians?  If
one reads the original post, one gets the impression that the primary
target is Keith, and the rest of it is more like a pox on anyone who is
his friend.

On the other hand, we know plenty of people who would have a base
motive to attack Keith Henson in any reprehensible way possible.
We might want to ask Ralph Merkle and the cryonics group if they have
heard from the perp.  What think ye?  spike

Ultimately - and here's a reason perhaps not to delete this thread after all 
- credibility will be one of the major commodities in the infoverse - 
quantifiable and bankable.  This person, whoever he or she is, has just 
created a bigtime negative credibility for him or herself, which WILL show 
up a decade from now as the infoverse starts building itself and a whole LOT 
of hidden worlds are revealed.

I always try to encourage people to keep records - especially older people 
who are witnesses to government or corporate attrocities.  But, in general, 
all the millions of private records and postings will one day be 
systematically sorted and collated and compared to build a virtual 
historical world.  Many crimes and criminals - as well as many heros and 
saints - will be revealed, and a lot of property titles will change hands.

Attacks from jerks may not prove that you are a good person, but in general 
I suspect that scurilious posts like the one accusing Max, will actually 
figure into raising his credibility, not lowering it.

There is research news from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, associated
with Harvard University:
http://www.dfci.harvard.edu/dfci/news/ie4/telomere.shtml
and reported in Science Daily:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/08/000811064001.htm

In aging humans tumors tend to appear in epithelial tissue. Because of a
lack of telomerase, when telomeres have been used up, cell division leads to
massive chromosomal damage. These cells enter a state called 'crisis'. If
they then regain the ability to make telomerase, these genetically damaged
cells move toward a cancerous state.

Normal mice produce telomerase in the epithelial tissues. Although they get
other kinds of cancers, they don't develop cancers like those seen in aging
humans. When knockout mice were created that did not produce telomerase in
the epithelial tissues, they exhibited cancer development like that seen in
aging humans.

This strikes me as very good news. It appears that the 'dark side' of
telomerase is manifested only when cells regain telomerase after having been
previously damaged by its absence. That seems to brighten considerably the
prospect of using telomerase as a component in an anti-aging therapy.

I'd have thought: more often, damaged in certain relevant oncogenic ways by
disruptive chemicals, oxidative stress, radiation mutation, etc.
(`accelerators' jammed on, `brakes' knocked out). But it would certainly be
interesting to know how much tumor-conducive damage is caused by copying
errors and the like due to telomere erosion in frequently-replaced cells.

Yes there are other Amaras. Not many. Most of them with Internet
access (usually teenage girls) have contacted me in the last 5 years
telling me that I have their name (!). I wish that Roy Amara was one of
them.

Interesting coincidence, that the Amara's Law quote resembled my
sci.physics post.  I'll have to write that lady in North Carolina and
tell her.

And I wonder who is the "Amara" that signed up for KCSM radio station
real audio feed from the S.F. Bay Area? I tried to sign up with an
"Amara" username a couple weeks ago, and it *was taken*.  (*sob*)

I was very saddened to learn of the slanderous and totally unfounded attacks against Max and Keith.  But, when people stand up to be counted it can bring forth the ire of the immature, ignorant and intolerant.  I hope both Max and Keith have not allowed the incident to ruffle their feathers too much.  

I have to admit messing with a group as cybersavvy as the extropians is simply stupid!!  This person may sooner than later regret having messed with such a formidable group.  May God have mercy on his/her soul because Greg Burch sure won't! ;)

I have heard Max is no stranger to threats and false allegations; which is very sad.  And Keith is a brave man to confront the Scientologists.  I read a book the "church" tried to ban which absolutely horrified me.  Some people seem to be helped by their methods but others are deeply hurt. 

One thing we could do is make people register in a more detailed and verifiable way before they could post.  This would make it harder for "hit and run" slander posts to be carried out.  I realize this could take some of the spontaneity out of the list so perhaps it is not a good idea.


sincerely,

Yes, for many many years (10+ ?). Keith sends occassional (say ~1/year) 
notes, to us (his Bay area and elsewhere friends) about the
status of his efforts.

I wonder how Jamiro can look at him/her-self in the mirror in the
morning, after writing that post.

I'm in on the reward for $300.  We should work out some specific terms for 
the reward -- I'll give it some thought this week.  Beyond that, I would 
consider it a magnanimous gesture if the winner of the reward would donate 
some or all of it to Keith's defense fund.

If cancer is a natural cap on lifespan, normally beaten to death by heart disease, organ
failure, or accident, then it is perhaps inextricably linked with that old cycle of doing
out with the old to make way for the new.

The forest fires are not so different, they are dangerous and have burned large areas of
timber, and I know not any expressible capital amount of damage the fires have caused,
although I think it little except for the very real hundreds of people who have lost
homes.

One good thing about the forest fires is that when the fires kick off again in the next
ten years, there will have been some burns already cleared, although they must be kept
free of secondary undergrowth which is too flammable, and thus by having been burned then
they will not burn and the firefighters can concentrate on Southern California.

Now, when we can determine good ways to ship the floods and hurricanes of the Atlantic
directly to these parched areas, then people will still talk about the weather.

Speaking of the weather, perhaps I am just too young to have seen cycles of fifty or a
hundred years and certainly of millenia, but the evidence I have seen from the
meterologists is that humans and their activites which affect the environment have done
so in a way that can not be easily reversed.  This environmental change (remember global
warming and the Ozone Layer and threat of lack of a one),  can only be slowed by
converting all the cars to fuels that burn to emit water and not CO2, CO, and nitrogen
and sulphur compounds we find in the air as we burn billions of pounds of ancient
fermented plankton, or the blood, or perhaps a humour, of the Earth.  Reversing it
requires letting the environment recover, and probably not yet massive industrial
planetary-wide air cleaners.  That is to say:  may we never have to terraform the Earth.

The cycle is a simple one:  use solar energy to generate electricity and split water into
hydrogen and oxygen, and burn it back for internal combustion needs.  Burning alcohol
from sustainable biomass is certainly a much better proposition for the environment which
many hope to inhabit indefinitely than is burning petro-sludge and particularly coal.

There are environmental realities about these environmental impacts:  people who mine,
sell, and burn coal want to keep doing so to make money, thus the planet wheezes and
burns in the sun.

Here's one for you:  almost each person on the planet breathes the same air.  So, if the
air is damaged, then each has been damaged.  Pow!  Class action suit, no more money in
coal.

This is a fantastic statement, but in twenty years everyone on the planet could be free
of what was priorly the natural age limit, perhaps barring brain cell disintegration.  Of
course, there would still be a limit.

Even if you can't bring legal action against this person, just knowing who
he or she is might prove a deterence to him or her and others from making
similar accusations in the future.

RE the recent attack on Max and Keith, my opinion is that the posts should stay
in the archive, but that these should have some caveat/editor's note included to
caution the reader about these unfounded allegations by some cipher, and if we
resolve the case and sue them, include this information as well, who the perp
is, what group he is acting in support of or on behalf of, etc..

You know you are a really movement and if you, an individual, has developed
influence in the world when you have whack jobs attacking you with BS like that.
When they do it in the tabloids you know you've really made it big.

Considering the money pledged so far, I think a chunk of this could be used by
anyone in LA with initiative to hire a gumshoe to go to the library and find out
who this guy is. Who wants to do it???

Unfortunately, these kinds of protestations and testimonials are not a 
useful response.  People who are found guilty in court, even those who are 
caught in the act often have quite a few people vouching for them.  It's 
not the kind of thing that acquaintainces would be able to detect.  The 
only thing this kind of response does is lend weight to the accusation by 
making it appear that a defense is worthwhile.

I'm as shocked as anyone, and as disbelieving as any.  (I know Keith 
somewhat better than I do Max.)  If there were anything to these 
accusations, they would be brought up in court.  In the absence of that, 
the best reaction to the accusation is silence.  Treat it as if a child 
farted in a nice restaurant.  Ignore it, or the child will do it again for 
the attention.

Not necessarily.  If the machine is hackable, someone else sitting at
home anywhere in the world could have possibly hacked a connection to
the computer in the public library and caused it to initiate the
outbound SMTP connection which sent the message.  Additionally,
someone could have spoofed the IP address of the computer in the
library.  IP spoofing is not that hard.  While none of these are
likely contingencies, they cannot be ruled out.

The bottom line is, as this lists' users ought to know from our
discussions of cryptography for security and authentication, if you
want true authentication you must *use digital signatures* with a
well-known signed key.  If a message arrives without a digital
signature you can have absolutely no assurance that it comes whence it
appears to come.

Everything else is like an unsigned typed postcard -- there's no
privacy and no authentication.  Meanwhile I do hope the malefactor is
found and forced to pay the penalty for libel.  But I agree with Spike
that we can expect more and more garbage on mailing lists and
websites; perhaps we may even see counter-intelligence type posts in
which people with a grudge post calumnies while masquerading as
well-known members of the list.  It is feasible that this could be
done with software to aid in mimicking the vocabulary and
Markov-chains of word sequences that characterize that poster's style,
not to mention using IP spoofing, hacked accounts, etc.

To be sure that mail *really* comes from whom it claims, a digital
signature guarded by a strong passphrase is required.  Fortunately, I
believe this list's readers to be intelligent enough to discriminate
among information sources and learn to expect and adopt authentication
for important communications.

All the best,
James Wetterau

It is worth noting this sort of thing in the eventuality that Extropianism
does become big or bothersome enough to worry the vested interests and
fundamentalist nutters ..... myself and many others have had to deal with
flak for years particularly from the god squad ... and one common theme
across all variants post-/trans-humanism (even my own natural magick/
post-human/ MVT evolutionary approach) is its strong *anti-supernaturalism
*(and de facto anti-Christianity).

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Hi,
Any thoughts on future transport?

I see a future with encapsulated 'cells' flowing, that is, circulating
through 'subway' tubes much like blood cells flow thru the body. Each safe
& private, magnetically cushioned transport cell, conveying one-six
passengers, could be individually programmed to reach its destination via
the shortest/fastest route in a flexible network of tubes.

I've been wondering how to address areas of heavy flow - Will 'plasma' be
neccesary to keep cells upright or from crashing if the tube system is
widened to accomodate areas of heavy traffic? or, Will T-Cells move only in
single file?

Why am I wondering? - been reading about the super toxic 'aromatic octane
enhancers - gasoline additives that replaced lead...   could these
neuro-toxic fumes be responsible for road rage? Do the oil companies have
thw world in an economic stranglehold?

Why is driving driving me mad? Or worse, idling at red lights.

I've only just seen this thread (my ISP's been down for two days) and,
while I'm pretty disgusted, I have to say that getting uptight over this
sort of allegation is counter-productive.

I can't speak for anyone else, but anonymous sock-puppets throwing
emotive accusations unsupported by evidence aren't going to convince
me of anything -- except that Max and Keith have some very dumb enemies
who are trying to be crudely manipulative.

On the other hand, I've been reading up on the Church of Scientology in
the past week or so -- research for a project -- and came across this
fun web page:

http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~av282/terms.htm

I'd like to urge any Extropians who don't know anything about the Co$ to
read as much of it as they can stomach. It's a dictionary.  It defines
referents within a language: concepts and terms used internally within
the Church. I don't think it's a fake. And I don't think I'm exaggerating
much if I state that trying to put myself inside the mind of someone
who thinks in these terms gives me the same queasy sensation I get when
I try to understand Nazism.

These guys would certainly consider libel, disinformation, and slander
to be acceptable ways of dealing with people who shine torches into the
murkier corners of their operations. And while they might deserve our
contempt (especially if, as seems likely, they're behind the flame-bait
posting that started this thread), they should be treated with the same
caution due to any other venomous insect.

Study: Biotech Corn Kills Monarch

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genetically engineered corn designed to kill an insect
pest spreads enough of its pollen on nearby weeds to kill monarch
butterflies, researchers said Monday in the latest study on the biotech
crop's environmental effects. 

Iowa State University scientists found that one in five monarch larvae died
after being exposed to the toxic corn pollen for two days. Three days after
the initial two-day exposure more than half of the larvae died. 

``In the field you may have higher mortality rates because of the cumulative
effect of being exposed to the toxin throughout the larval stage,'' said
researcher John Obrycki, whose study appears in the Internet edition of the
journal Oecologia. ``Coming up with a good ecological assessment of this
technology probably needed to be done before planting it across the
Midwest.'' 

The biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacterium gene that makes it toxic
to the European corn borer, became controversial last year after a
laboratory study at Cornell University showed it was toxic to monarch
butterflies. 

The corn's pollen coats the leaves of nearby milkweed plants that butterfly
caterpillars eat. 

The Cornell finding produced a public outcry in Europe and calls from
environmental groups to curb the spread of gene-altered crops, but biotech
supporters have criticized that study and the one from Iowa State for being
unrealistic. 

``Much of what (the Iowa State study) reports is based on analyses taking
place in laboratory manipulations rather than field conditions,'' said Val
Giddings, vice president of food and agriculture for the Biotechnology
Industry Organization. 

The Iowa State researchers planted breeds of biotech corn that produced
different levels of the insecticide pollen along with some corn that hadn't
been engineered. They then placed potted milkweed plants at varying
distances from the fields. After two or three days they took the milkweed
plants into the lab and exposed the butterflies to the plant leaves. 

Significant numbers of butterflies died after exposure to leaves coated with
pollen, while those placed with leaves that were washed or unexposed to the
Bt pollen died at a normal rate. 

Giddings said butterfly caterpillars are unlikely to encounter the pollen in
nature in any great numbers and that the monarch butterfly population
increased almost as much as the plantings of Bt corn last year. 

An estimated 19 percent of the 80 million acres of corn growing this year
was Bt. 

Environmental groups have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to
have farmers surround fields of Bt corn with buffer zones of conventional
corn to prevent the pollen from spreading to milkweed. 

``Continued inaction would clearly be lethal to monarch butterflies,'' said
Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist at Environmental Defense, a group critical of
genetically engineered crops. 

The EPA has been reviewing its standard for biotech crops and plans to
release recommendations in September, said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant
administrator of the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. 

Early this year the EPA put new planting restrictions on Bt corn to prevent
insects from developing resistance to the toxin. The restrictions require
farmers to plant at least 20 percent conventional corn in most regions, and
50 percent in areas where cotton is grown. 

In June, University of Illinois scientists placed black swallowtail
butterflies near a farmer's field and found no evidence that they were
harmed by the biotech corn. The swallowtail is considered less sensitive to
the corn toxin than the monarch, but is more likely to be exposed to the
pollen. 

************************************

Can anyone point me to where this "research" is being published? I'd like to
actually see the methodology. Specifically, what does "exposure" mean?

Before you all get carried away... I'll inject my personal experience.  In
my youthful searching, I stumbled across Scientology and joined the Honolulu
Org.  I signed a 5 year contract, but only served 3 of it.  I was declared a
suppressive person (depressive is closer to the truth!) for not showing up
to work too many times.

The url above is incredibly biased and inaccurate.  I got only part-way into
the "A" terms before it was very apparent that this wasn't factual reporting
but just another bit of slander... the exact thing it accuses Scientology of
doing.

Don't get me wrong, I am not a scientologist, nor am I sympathetic to the
religion, but I am interested in facts, not hyperbole and slander.  That URL
directly contradicts actual facts... and puts as nasty a spin as possible on
the facts it does get right.

I realize this is an emotional issue... but let cooler heads prevail here.
Lets not go rushing off to find enemies, demons and other creeps behind
every prank post.  Further, lets not support thinly disguised religious
bigotry.  Scientology is silly enough on it's own merits (or lack of them)
just like any other religion.

Cysteine is supposed to be a precursor of glutathione peroxidase, and
N-acetyl cysteine is supposed to be a form that maximizes the portion
available for that use. It's one of the supplements I use. According to what
I've read, Alpha lipoic acid is a kind of 'master' anti-oxidant that can
renew many other anti-oxidants. I've been using that also.  I'll be watching
with interest to see what feedback you get regarding superoxide dismutase
and catalase.

Does anyone know of any safe accessible oral drugs that increase levels of
Superoxide dismutase; glutathione peroxidase and catalase (separately or
together...)?

Hi everyone.

This is off topic, but my company has just officially launched its web
presence and I would like to invite everyone to take a look:

www.wildghost.com

Dial-up users will probably not be able to watch video on the site...
apologies in advance.


Comments always appreciated.

Well, there was a Joseph Steel. At least, that's the English translation. In
the original Russian it was Josif Stalin.

So?  Read what Neo Nazi groups say about Judaism.

>From the very first question on the "faq":

"People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology.
What I have against CoS is its deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its
members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its
arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of
its critics, its lack of concern for families,

***** its gross neglect and abuse of children ****, etc.

Hate is a destructive emotion, I strive to be constructive. My opposition to
CoS is based on rational investigation of available information, not
emotions." ?????!


Emphasis mine.  Note this is the same thing that has us up in arms when
aimed at one of our own.

Apply the same standards to Scientology critics as you do to anything else
(Say a speech by Jeremy Riftkin).

Once again... first, there is currently no proof that anybody associated
with CoS had anything to do with the attack on Max, and second, by repeating
hearsay (posting urls of obvious hate sites) you are as guilty as any
religious bigots.

And, just to remind you where my loyalties lie...  I am an ex member of the
CoS.  I have been declared a "suppressive person" by that organization and
according to their accounting methods (any service received while on staff
becomes payable in full if you don't complete your contract) I owe them over
10,000 dollars.

Despite the (false) horror stories promulgated by CoS haters, I have not
been harassed in any way by the CoS.

Lets be rational folks.

Considering the money pledged so far, I think a chunk of this could be used by
anyone in LA with initiative to hire a gumshoe to go to the library and find out
who this guy is. Who wants to do it???

   Dr Morton Schulman has just passed away aged 75, of complications from
 Parkinson's disease. He introduced North America to Deprenyl. He was also
 a crusading ex-coroner, said to be the model for the TV series Wojeck,
 ex-member of the Ontario legislature, ex-talkshow host, and now
 unfortunately also ex-alive.
   On a personal note I once mailed him some medical reports detailing the
 clinical benefits of magnetic brain stimulation in some Parkinson's
 disease patients. Ever direct and to the point he mailed these back to
 me, with a one word appended note: "nonsense".
   The life-extension movement has lost one of its own.

Chris Heward spoke about this idea back at Extro-1 and Extro-2, and it has recently become the Kronos Group, based in Arizona, but with clinics planned to open in many cities. The program involves a full day of testing of numerous physiological functions, and then carefully personalized recommendations. They do not want to be described as a "life extension" group, but as involved in "age management". 

Natasha and I will be going through the program next month. They will do a follow-up in six months, and then I think once a year. I'll be happy to report on my experience there in about a month.

Their web site is:

http://www.thekronosgroup.com/
(end)

I read over the website and found it fascinating to say the least.  I thought they had a very realisitic attitude toward managing aging in terms of it being inevitable(for now).  And yet making it a somewhat controlled process by personalizing a program to slow it and avoid debilitating diseases.  This organization is an idea whose idea has come.  

I can easily guess that the services of Kronos do not come cheap...  I am curious to know just how expensive they are.  These clinics will definitely be for those who have fought and succeeded in the economic arena.  Or at least had a wealthy mate/friend/relative who did and shared with them the bounty.  I wonder if even on a teacher's salary(should I ever graduate from college...) I could afford their services a decade from now?  I will than be an ancient forty-three year old.  

I was a little disturbed about the section of the website about executive fitness.  I can understand a corporation wanting to know the mental and physical fitness of their key employees but I could see this being abused.  "Yep, this med report proves the old man is losing it, can him!"

I really look forward to reading the accounts of you and Natasha visiting Kronos.  I would think both of you would get glowing bills of good health.  Or at least bills.. :)

best wishes,

John

P.S. At the rate cryonics research is going I definitely want both of you in this program! lol

Chris Heward spoke about this idea back at Extro-1 and Extro-2, and it has recently become the Kronos Group, based in Arizona, but with clinics planned to open in many cities. The program involves a full day of testing of numerous physiological functions,
 and then carefully personalized recommendations. They do not want to be described as a "life extension" group, but as involved in "age management". 

Natasha and I will be going through the program next month. They will do a follow-up in six months, and then I think once a year. I'll be happy to report on my experience there in about a month.

Their web site is:

http://www.thekronosgroup.com/
(end)

I read over the website and found it fascinating to say the least.  I thought they had a very realisitic attitude toward managing aging in terms of it being inevitable(for now).  And yet making it a somewhat controlled process by personalizing a program t
o slow it and avoid debilitating diseases.  This organization is an idea whose idea has come.  

I can easily guess that the services of Kronos do not come cheap...  I am curious to know just how expensive they are.  These clinics will definitely be for those who have fought and succeeded in the economic arena.  Or at least had a wealthy mate/friend/
relative who did and shared with them the bounty.  I wonder if even on a teacher's salary(should I ever graduate from college...) I could afford their services a decade from now?  I will than be an ancient forty-three year old.  

I was a little disturbed about the section of the website about executive fitness.  I can understand a corporation wanting to know the mental and physical fitness of their key employees but I could see this being abused.  "Yep, this med report proves the 
old man is losing it, can him!"

I really look forward to reading the accounts of you and Natasha visiting Kronos.  I would think both of you would get glowing bills of good health.  Or at least bills.. :)

best wishes,

John

P.S. At the rate cryonics research is going I definitely want both of you in this program! lol

I'd just like to say that I've never met Max More and don't know anything 
about him other than what I've read on the web and in some magazines, and 
his occasional posts to this list.  However, I did not for one minute place 
any credence in the accusations contained in the post that started this 
thread for the simple reasons (1) that the poster has at all times concealed 
anything about ver true identity and (2) such dreadfully serious accusations 
were casually made without any reference or corroboration whatsoever.

It was clear to me that the poster was a troll.  If the poster's identity is 
ever discovered let me know Max and I'd be happy to represent you in your 
libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action.

So?  Read what Neo Nazi groups say about Judaism.

>From the very first question on the "faq":

"People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology.
What I have against CoS is its deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its
members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its
arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of
its critics, its lack of concern for families,

***** its gross neglect and abuse of children ****, etc.

Hate is a destructive emotion, I strive to be constructive. My opposition to
CoS is based on rational investigation of available information, not
emotions." ?????!


Emphasis mine.  Note this is the same thing that has us up in arms when
aimed at one of our own.

Apply the same standards to Scientology critics as you do to anything else
(Say a speech by Jeremy Riftkin).

Once again... first, there is currently no proof that anybody associated
with CoS had anything to do with the attack on Max, and second, by repeating
hearsay (posting urls of obvious hate sites) you are as guilty as any
religious bigots.

And, just to remind you where my loyalties lie...  I am an ex member of the
CoS.  I have been declared a "suppressive person" by that organization and
according to their accounting methods (any service received while on staff
becomes payable in full if you don't complete your contract) I owe them over
10,000 dollars.

Despite the (false) horror stories promulgated by CoS haters, I have not
been harassed in any way by the CoS.

Lets be rational folks.

You can forget about it.  I use the LA Library computers all the time and 
you don't have to set up an account.  All you have to do is sign in (they 
don't even verify your real name by making you show ID).  In fact if a 
machine is free, you don't even have to sign in.  You just sit down and 
surf.  So our libelist has made a clean get away.

Hi everyone.

This is off topic, but my company has just officially launched its web
presence and I would like to invite everyone to take a look:

Dial-up users will probably not be able to watch video on the site...
apologies in advance.


Comments always appreciated.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Hi,
Any thoughts on future transport?

I see a future with encapsulated 'cells' flowing, that is, circulating
through 'subway' tubes much like blood cells flow thru the body. Each safe
& private, magnetically cushioned transport cell, conveying one-six
passengers, could be individually programmed to reach its destination via
the shortest/fastest route in a flexible network of tubes.

I've been wondering how to address areas of heavy flow - Will 'plasma' be
neccesary to keep cells upright or from crashing if the tube system is
widened to accomodate areas of heavy traffic? or, Will T-Cells move only in
single file?

Why am I wondering? - been reading about the super toxic 'aromatic octane
enhancers - gasoline additives that replaced lead...   could these
neuro-toxic fumes be responsible for road rage? Do the oil companies have
thw world in an economic stranglehold?

Why is driving driving me mad? Or worse, idling at red lights.

In general I tend to agree that the archives should be allowed to remain 
uncut.  However, I'm not so sure I'd agree if someone had accused me of the 
ridiculous things written by Jamiro.  Also, Max is a fairly famous person by 
now.  All he'd need is for someone from a quality publication like the 
National Enquirer to get a hold of that preposterous post and splash an 
extrapolation of it across the front page (say for instance if Max decides 
to run for political office someday).

My vote: Delete the thread!  (Proclaimed with the same gusto and 
authoritarianism of Pink Floyd's "Tear down the wall!")

Unfortunately, these kinds of protestations and testimonials are not a 
useful response.  People who are found guilty in court, even those who are 
caught in the act often have quite a few people vouching for them.  It's 
not the kind of thing that acquaintainces would be able to detect.  The 
only thing this kind of response does is lend weight to the accusation by 
making it appear that a defense is worthwhile.

I'm as shocked as anyone, and as disbelieving as any.  (I know Keith 
somewhat better than I do Max.)  If there were anything to these 
accusations, they would be brought up in court.  In the absence of that, 
the best reaction to the accusation is silence.  Treat it as if a child 
farted in a nice restaurant.  Ignore it, or the child will do it again for 
the attention.

Cysteine is supposed to be a precursor of glutathione peroxidase, and
N-acetyl cysteine is supposed to be a form that maximizes the portion
available for that use. It's one of the supplements I use. According to what
I've read, Alpha lipoic acid is a kind of 'master' anti-oxidant that can
renew many other anti-oxidants. I've been using that also.  I'll be watching
with interest to see what feedback you get regarding superoxide dismutase
and catalase.

I've only just seen this thread (my ISP's been down for two days) and,
while I'm pretty disgusted, I have to say that getting uptight over this
sort of allegation is counter-productive.

I can't speak for anyone else, but anonymous sock-puppets throwing
emotive accusations unsupported by evidence aren't going to convince
me of anything -- except that Max and Keith have some very dumb enemies
who are trying to be crudely manipulative.

On the other hand, I've been reading up on the Church of Scientology in
the past week or so -- research for a project -- and came across this
fun web page:

http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~av282/terms.htm

I'd like to urge any Extropians who don't know anything about the Co$ to
read as much of it as they can stomach. It's a dictionary.  It defines
referents within a language: concepts and terms used internally within
the Church. I don't think it's a fake. And I don't think I'm exaggerating
much if I state that trying to put myself inside the mind of someone
who thinks in these terms gives me the same queasy sensation I get when
I try to understand Nazism.

These guys would certainly consider libel, disinformation, and slander
to be acceptable ways of dealing with people who shine torches into the
murkier corners of their operations. And while they might deserve our
contempt (especially if, as seems likely, they're behind the flame-bait
posting that started this thread), they should be treated with the same
caution due to any other venomous insect.

Before you all get carried away... I'll inject my personal experience.  In
my youthful searching, I stumbled across Scientology and joined the Honolulu
Org.  I signed a 5 year contract, but only served 3 of it.  I was declared a
suppressive person (depressive is closer to the truth!) for not showing up
to work too many times.

The url above is incredibly biased and inaccurate.  I got only part-way into
the "A" terms before it was very apparent that this wasn't factual reporting
but just another bit of slander... the exact thing it accuses Scientology of
doing.

Don't get me wrong, I am not a scientologist, nor am I sympathetic to the
religion, but I am interested in facts, not hyperbole and slander.  That URL
directly contradicts actual facts... and puts as nasty a spin as possible on
the facts it does get right.

I realize this is an emotional issue... but let cooler heads prevail here.
Lets not go rushing off to find enemies, demons and other creeps behind
every prank post.  Further, lets not support thinly disguised religious
bigotry.  Scientology is silly enough on it's own merits (or lack of them)
just like any other religion.

It is worth noting this sort of thing in the eventuality that Extropianism
does become big or bothersome enough to worry the vested interests and
fundamentalist nutters ..... myself and many others have had to deal with
flak for years particularly from the god squad ... and one common theme
across all variants post-/trans-humanism (even my own natural magick/
post-human/ MVT evolutionary approach) is its strong *anti-supernaturalism
*(and de facto anti-Christianity).

Study: Biotech Corn Kills Monarch

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genetically engineered corn designed to kill an insect
pest spreads enough of its pollen on nearby weeds to kill monarch
butterflies, researchers said Monday in the latest study on the biotech
crop's environmental effects. 

Iowa State University scientists found that one in five monarch larvae died
after being exposed to the toxic corn pollen for two days. Three days after
the initial two-day exposure more than half of the larvae died. 

``In the field you may have higher mortality rates because of the cumulative
effect of being exposed to the toxin throughout the larval stage,'' said
researcher John Obrycki, whose study appears in the Internet edition of the
journal Oecologia. ``Coming up with a good ecological assessment of this
technology probably needed to be done before planting it across the
Midwest.'' 

The biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacterium gene that makes it toxic
to the European corn borer, became controversial last year after a
laboratory study at Cornell University showed it was toxic to monarch
butterflies. 

The corn's pollen coats the leaves of nearby milkweed plants that butterfly
caterpillars eat. 

The Cornell finding produced a public outcry in Europe and calls from
environmental groups to curb the spread of gene-altered crops, but biotech
supporters have criticized that study and the one from Iowa State for being
unrealistic. 

``Much of what (the Iowa State study) reports is based on analyses taking
place in laboratory manipulations rather than field conditions,'' said Val
Giddings, vice president of food and agriculture for the Biotechnology
Industry Organization. 

The Iowa State researchers planted breeds of biotech corn that produced
different levels of the insecticide pollen along with some corn that hadn't
been engineered. They then placed potted milkweed plants at varying
distances from the fields. After two or three days they took the milkweed
plants into the lab and exposed the butterflies to the plant leaves. 

Significant numbers of butterflies died after exposure to leaves coated with
pollen, while those placed with leaves that were washed or unexposed to the
Bt pollen died at a normal rate. 

Giddings said butterfly caterpillars are unlikely to encounter the pollen in
nature in any great numbers and that the monarch butterfly population
increased almost as much as the plantings of Bt corn last year. 

An estimated 19 percent of the 80 million acres of corn growing this year
was Bt. 

Environmental groups have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to
have farmers surround fields of Bt corn with buffer zones of conventional
corn to prevent the pollen from spreading to milkweed. 

``Continued inaction would clearly be lethal to monarch butterflies,'' said
Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist at Environmental Defense, a group critical of
genetically engineered crops. 

The EPA has been reviewing its standard for biotech crops and plans to
release recommendations in September, said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant
administrator of the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. 

Early this year the EPA put new planting restrictions on Bt corn to prevent
insects from developing resistance to the toxin. The restrictions require
farmers to plant at least 20 percent conventional corn in most regions, and
50 percent in areas where cotton is grown. 

In June, University of Illinois scientists placed black swallowtail
butterflies near a farmer's field and found no evidence that they were
harmed by the biotech corn. The swallowtail is considered less sensitive to
the corn toxin than the monarch, but is more likely to be exposed to the
pollen. 

************************************

Can anyone point me to where this "research" is being published? I'd like to
actually see the methodology. Specifically, what does "exposure" mean?

All I've found so far is the silybinin thing ... and that high dose vit E

You can forget about it.  I use the LA Library computers all the time and 
you don't have to set up an account.  All you have to do is sign in (they 
don't even verify your real name by making you show ID).  In fact if a 
machine is free, you don't even have to sign in.  You just sit down and 
surf.  So our libelist has made a clean get away.

In general I tend to agree that the archives should be allowed to remain 
uncut.  However, I'm not so sure I'd agree if someone had accused me of the 
ridiculous things written by Jamiro.  Also, Max is a fairly famous person by 
now.  All he'd need is for someone from a quality publication like the 
National Enquirer to get a hold of that preposterous post and splash an 
extrapolation of it across the front page (say for instance if Max decides 
to run for political office someday).

My vote: Delete the thread!  (Proclaimed with the same gusto and 
authoritarianism of Pink Floyd's "Tear down the wall!")

I'd just like to say that I've never met Max More and don't know anything 
about him other than what I've read on the web and in some magazines, and 
his occasional posts to this list.  However, I did not for one minute place 
any credence in the accusations contained in the post that started this 
thread for the simple reasons (1) that the poster has at all times concealed 
anything about ver true identity and (2) such dreadfully serious accusations 
were casually made without any reference or corroboration whatsoever.

It was clear to me that the poster was a troll.  If the poster's identity is 
ever discovered let me know Max and I'd be happy to represent you in your 
libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action.

The links did work for me.  His posts to alt.memetics all popped up for me.  
Perhaps someone who has the time or the inclination might want to lurk that

him.

  While the U.S. media faithfully blacked out the
  press conference of a panel of independent experts
  who disagree with the official investigation of the
  TWA Flight 800 crash, Agence France Presse cites it.
  Of particular note is that the flight data recorder
  (FDR) expert who examined the black boxes claims
  that four seconds were removed from the FDR data.

  Indeed, one FDR second found in the NTSB's 1997
  report was suddenly erased from that report at
  (http://users.erols.com/igoddard/coverup3.htm)
  the NTSB's website shortly after former Navy
  crash investigator William Donaldson presented
  an analysis about that erased FDR second which
  concluded that it indicates a missile strike:

Independent panel criticizes TWA Flight 800 crash report

WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (AFP) -

An independent panel of experts on Monday lambasted the
results of an official investigation into the 1996 fatal
TWA Flight 800 crash, and maintained its theory the plane
was downed by a missile.

According to the Flight 800 Independent Research Organization
(FIRO), the official investigators had concealed crucial
pieces of information from a final report to be presented
Tuesday and Wednesday.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report is
expected to argue that the crash which killed 230 people
off Long Island, New York, was most likely caused by an
explosion in the plane's central fuel tank.

Many former investigators, military experts, and airline
pilots continue to insist the Boeing was shot down by a missile.

"Thirteen witnesses have seen an object strike the plane,"
FIRO president Tom Stalcup said in a press conference here.

Stalcup also argued against the investigators' theory that
the plane had gained altitude following an initial explosion.

"The magic climb theory contradicts the laws of physics,
the radar data which recorded the flight path, and the
witnesses accounts," he said.

Moreover, Stalcup continued, there were numerous ships
within five kilometers (3.6 miles) of the area, but only
one that had never been identified and which continued on
its path as if nothing had happened.

Aviation consultant engineer Glen Schulze, who analyzed the
so-called "black boxes," also claimed that information was missing.

"Four seconds of data has been removed from the Flight Data
Recorder when the FBI was in charge of the investigation," he said.

Lending his weight to the argument of possible foul play,
retired United Airlines pilot Richard Russell claimed he had
received a copy of radar data showing a small object flying
next to the plane that indicated a possible missile.

"An (air traffic) controller has identified the target as
potentially being a missile," Russell said, declining to
identify his source of information.

NTSB investigators have explained that bystanders may have
been looking at an arc of fire in the sky that occurred after
the airplane broke in two and a part of the fuselage was briefly
hurtled into the sky in flames.

The FBI initially tried to probe the missile theory, but later
abandoned it and withdrew from the investigation altogether in
the fall of 1997.

Six months after the catastrophe, the NTSB concluded that
chemical analyses of metal from the fuselage showed no proof
of damage caused by a bomb or missile.

Nevertheless, after four years of recovering debris from the
ocean floor and partially reconstructing the plane in a huge
hangar, investigators are preparing to close this most mysterious
chapter in aviation history -- but without giving a definitive answer.

"It's a mystery, but a manufactured mystery," insisted Graeme
Sephton, a projects engineer at the University of Massachusetts
office of Information Technologies.

Same warning applies to taking too much Vit C, if you are low in
glutathione.  GSH is required to recycle Vit C from the oxidised form and,
if you take only vit C without addresing glutathione deficiency, you may
worsen your glutathione problem.

Not sure if I mentioned this before, but taking undenatured whey is reported
to be quite effective in restoring glutathione levels.  The stuff commonly
available from health food stores as a body-building supplement has been
heat-treated, and isn't very effective.  You can buy ImmunoPro from NEEDS,
or the LEF (www.lef.org) does a version (slightly weaker).

Start off with a low dose and work cautiously up.  There is a transcript of
a workshop by Dr Paul Cheney discussing the use of whey at:
	http://home.tiscalinet.be/nvdeynde/cfs/cheney/1.htm

I believe Selenium is also required to make one of the key enzymes, so make
sure you get enough of that (not much more than 200mcg a day - toxic in
large doses).


Regards,



Laeeth.

Well, for anyone from Britain here who was around in the late 70's/early
80's, they might remember a character from a TV called "Saphire & Steel".
Was Sci-Fi if I remember correctly.  I'm pretty sure the name was John Steel.

The character Steel was played by Robert McCallum, of "Man from Uncle" fame.

Note: This is my last message. I understand and respect that you don't want to hear from me anymore, but I did want to post this last reply.

                 ***

I am sorry if my last post has been upsetting to all of you. However, 
if you carefully read what I said in the part that triggered your 
reactions, it was the following:

"I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists 
are guilty of sexually abusing children (Keith Henson, for example), 
and I recently came across a persistent rumor that the same is true 
of Max More (incidentally a friend of Henson?) as well."

In other words, I said I had come across a verbal accusation from a trusted source. I openly admit that I do not at this point have legal evidence, but have strong enough indications to make me suspicious or curious. 

When I bring this up here, I get attacked, pushed into weird pseudo-philosophical corners and threatened with all kinds of legal and semi-legal attacks. 
One poster in fact goes as far as using the word "lynch". All I hear from Mr More is I am a liar and he wants to sue me. Others want to remove the whole thread from the archive, thereby censoring free speech.

Remember when technology was the best friend of most of the mainstream 
environmentalist movement?  New crops would limit the amount of farmland
needed.  Solar power (and even nuclear power) would reduce our reliance upon
polluting coal and oil.  Maglev trains would make nosy, fuel-guzzling 
aircraft obsolete.  Increased understanding of ecology was going to allow us
to clean up polluted sites and held up better manage and protect endangered
species.

well, what has changed?  "No new rail" cry environmentalist groups in the Bay
Area.  "Frankenfoods" cry environmentalists in Europe.  Signs protesting 
technology at all levels have been seen amongst the protesters outside the WTO
meeting, the World Bank meeting, and the RNC and DNC gatherings in Philadelphia
and Los Angeles.  Ted Kazcinski (sp?) is slowly becoming what he most wanted
to be and what msot peopel scoffed at him ever becoming: a role model, an
architect of what is increasingly becoming the manifesto of the neo-Luddite 
movement.

When and where did we lose ground, and how can we remedy this situation?  I'd
begin by saying that many of the technological solutions have been poorly 
implemented, overhyped, and require a lot of social reengineering to be 
plausible on the scale they were sold for.  Economic realities have sapped
the urgency of some of the broadest-reaching but expensive "green" 
technologies.  And finally, a combination of success in environmental causes
and a growing  retrospiritual movement has led to the "religionizing" of the
Left.

Environmentalism is becoming more f a religion than a sociopolitical thought,
at least organized environmentalism.  The initial arguement against GM foods,
for example, is the questions it poses for vegetarians, partticulaly those
who have spiritual reasons for not eating meat - how many animal genes must
be in something before it is considered an animal?  Also amongst 
environmentalists, the notion of corporations as evil, and technologists as
simply handmaidens for "corporate greed" (are these two words even separable
anymore?) is accepted axiomatically.  In the eyes of most environmentalists, 
ANY technology is evil, and will eventually aid and abet the "pave the earth"
mentality, regardless o fhow "green" it may seem.

The economic reality of the world has changed since the 1970s.  OPEc seems 
unwilling to play the sort of embargo games that gave the green technology 
movement such a boost in the 1970s.  Growth in affluence, especially in the 
United States, has led consumers to accept higher energy costs as a simple
fact of life - there is no clamouring for a new clean technology in a world
where 8 MPG SUVs are a status symbol.  Unfortunately, with the slowly lowering
costs of energy and steel and other manufacturing goods, green technologies 
cannot really compete economically.  And without price pressures to look for an
alternative, certain key technologies (i.e. batteries) are moving slowly.

Unforutnately, green technology was also oversold, without taking into account 
certain social values that make it difficult to implement.  Take, for example,
rail.  Maglev rail has not really taken off as a means of moving people outside
of certain runs in Europe and in Japan, both places where society is less
car and space-oriented.  In the United States, the "American Dream" still 
involves owning a private home in the suburbs, far away from the noise, bustle
and crime of the cities.  Unfortunately, this has led to suburban sprawl, which
is extremely inefficient for rail travel.  Additionally, after airline 
deregulation, in addition to the lowered cost of fuel, aircraft tickets  have 
become cheaper in real terms than hey were during the 1970s, for most 
domestic flights in the US.

Fortunately, most of the public does not yet buy into the Fundamentalist Left's
ideas of what environmentalism is.  There is still room to combat this image,
and promote a more rational environmentalism, where technology is a key part.
I would say we have little choice; it won't be long before there is a movement
to ban all space launches because of the pollution caused by rocket engines.

I for one do not understand how you could not have foreseen the "fury" that you created.  To not foresee the reaction appears to me to be the height of ignorance, when it is obvious that many of the individuals on the list are colleagues/Friends or at least admire Mr. More and the things he has accomplished.  This is after all the extropian mailing list, and the Extropy institute was in fact started by Max More.  If it is not ignorance on your part then it demonstrates a frightening lack of empathy to be so surprised at the reactions.

The action that you took was simply mean spirited, and could serve no redeeming purpose.  I read your statement and I am sorry if you do not see it but it is tantamount to accusing an individual that we respect of a heinous crime.  Not only was it rude of you to do so, it was extremely innappropriate.  Imagine if in a public forum someone accused you of (random horrific act inserted here).

>If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...

This is a ridiculous request.  Yes or No "Mr. Miller", have you stopped beating your wife?  Your tactics are cheap and insulting, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  If the best you can come up with is rumor then you ought to keep silent.  If you have evidence (which you stated that you have none) then you ought to go to the police.  Any other action is nothing more than a poor attempt at a smear campaign.

I for one have no respect for you or your tactics Jamiro.
It is for this reason I have chosen not to respond to your unfounded accusation in regards to Mr. More, and have instead only spoken to your tactics.

Read your own writing. You are specifically NOT saying that these are
allegations, nor are you posting your sources. You are making claims as to
actual facts. To claim that you are not doing so is a lie.

No, you said "I know", not "I've read reports" or "I've seen allegations". These
are very different things. You also say 'are guilty', not 'alleged'. These are
also very different things.

Free speech does not include the right to scream FIRE in a theater.

Unjustly accusing a person of a despicable crime is one of the cardinal sins of
our civilization. Since we know Max, and you, as far as we are concerned, are
absolutely nobody, it is you upon whom the outrage rests and the burden of proof
lies.

>

Bullshit. If it was unintentional, then you must be functionally illiterate with
the IQ of a casava melon.

Ah bullshit again. You're just trying to keep the friggin thing going. 

Here's some info about where this Bozo is posting from, and the relatively close
proximity of significant Scientologist facilities:

2 miles away:
HGB, the Hollywood Guarranty  Building, a twelve story office building at
Hollywood Boulevard and Ivar formerly owned by the Bank of America. It is an old
building that was constructed in the 1920s and purchased by Scientology with
cash in the mid-'80s. All International management (upper middle management
above continents and below *INT* - see Int) is located in this building. It is a
twenty minute walk from the Cedars Complex, and houses IHELP, OSA Int, and the
CMO IXU (Internal eXtension Unit), WISE Int, ABLE Int, and more. The various
orgs on different floors in 1993 looked like this: 12th floor - OSA Int
(includes office of the President of CSI). 11th - CMO IXU, AVU Int, confidential
space. 10th - FCB, Networks. 9th - FB. 8th - FB, IHELP Int, SMI Int. 7th - WISE
Int, ABLE Int. 6th - Dining room, canteen. 5th through 1st - ITO. 1st - LRH
Exhibit, lobby. Basement - HGB Estates, FB's mimeo collection, INCOMM office. 

Other locations:
~2000 feet from the Los Feliz Library
  CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY ADVANCED ORGANIZATION
   1404 N CATALINA ST,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90027
   Phone: (323) 953-3200 

Less than 1 mile away:
  CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER INTERNATL
   5930 FRANKLIN AVE,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90028
   Phone: (323) 960-3100 

(This is the HGB Building referenced above:)
  CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
   6331 HOLLYWOOD BLVD STE 801,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90028
   Phone: (323) 960-3500 

~2000 feet from the Los Feliz library:
  CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY LOS ANGELES
   4810 W SUNSET BLVD,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90027
   Phone: (323) 953-3200 

Four blocks from HGB:
  SCIENTOLOGY CHURCH OF TESTING CENTER
   6724 HOLLYWOOD BLVD,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90028
   Phone: (323) 465-8515 

It seems to me as though there is significant support for the Co$ theory. There
is no listing at www.whitepages.com for a 'Jamrio Miller', though there are a
number of 'J Miller' listings in the Hollywood area. There is a James R Miller
in the 90024 zip code.

Here is a challenge: retract your statement in its entirety, and post the
'trusted sources' you claim are making the accusations so that they may be
examined as any evidence properly should be.

I just read this carefully. It says you KNOW Keith is guilty and then tried to implicate Max.

> In other words, I said I had come across a verbal accusation from a trusted source. I openly admit that I do not at this point have legal evidence, but have strong enough indications to make me suspicious or curious.

Oops. Now you just said, "in other words". You don't actually know. You said heard from someone who made an accusation. You also said you are "suspicious and curious". You are a rumor monger at best. If you don't know
the difference between fact and second hand information, what the hell are you doing on this list?

bandwidth with the expected backlash that will follow from his posts.  Do 
what you want, but after this post I vow not to honor his baiting tactics 
with any further response.

Below is a request originally posted to a Tissue Culture list I'm on.  I'm
passing it on to this list, since there's been some interest here in GM
plants.

Barbara

========================================================

Forest Research (a forestry related scientific organistaion) in New Zealand
has applied to ERMA New Zealand (Environmental Risk Management Authority)
for approval to conduct two contained field trial experiments of transgenic
radiata pine and spruce in Rotorua, New Zealand. The summaries and the full
text of the applications can be obtained from ERMA (www.ermanz.govt.nz) or
from
Christian Walter (christian.walter@forestresearch.co.nz).
The  participatory democracy advocate web site
have developed a website and electronic
submission form that allows any interested party or individual to make
submissions to the applications.
We would appreciate support for these applications from the scientific
community world wide making supporting submissions (see website mentioned
below) to ERMA (deadline is August 30, 2000).
I'd like to point out that the comments made on the website are implying
that the field trial is in association with forestry companies and
multinationals. This is not correct. The field trials are fully funded by
reserach funds provided by the New Zealand Government.

Many thanks for your support.

Maybe Hans has shifted his estimate into the future by yet another decade,
then (it's hard to tell from the brief article). In MIND CHILDREN it was
2030. In ROBOT, 2040.

To tell you the truth, I found this to be quite interesting as well.  As
much as I respect Hans, and as much as I enjoyed the article, I would still
opt to agree more with his _Mind Children_ prediction of 2030.  By that
time, Moore's Law should have been shattered to a considerable extent, and
de Garis' work on neural networks should have reached the human brainpower
stage.  

Still, the farther off you make "predictions" when talking to the general
public, the less likely you'll be considered a "kook" in public eyes.

While it may seem belated, I'm inspired today to comment on John Clark's
"6 reasons for nanotech to work more easily than macrotech":

This is a really good point, and a major reason to expect good economy
from nanomanufacturing. However, one has to be just a little bit
cautious about the idea of replicating things from cheap atoms. For
instance, to get a useful feed stock for nanofactories you'd have to
purify some sort of construction material, a material such as an
alcohol, for instance. Uncontrolled impurities could "poison" your
construction machines, bonding with things in such a way as to spoil
your project. Also, people love to talk about mining incredibly diluted
elements (like gold) from sea water. However, if you have to concentrate
things too much, the energy cost may be worth more than the market value
of what you've mined, even with the help of nano-built systems for
getting the energy.

Before, Dan Fabulich responded that programmed nanoconstruction might
actually involve the assembly of many kind of blocks, or "chunks" at
many different levels. Any real experts out there, game to engage in
relative parts counting exercises? Didn't someone mention that Robert
Freitas had something positive to say about this?

Better to say that atoms can't be damaged by mere handling, but that
radiation damage is a general concern. Also, see my comment on the
*wearing out* of parts, below.

Atoms have the premade, dependable, sizes and characteristics that
Nature provides for them. I'm not sure though, if this is an advantage,
or more of a neutral thing? Dependability is good, other times though,
you might wish you could trim to fit!

This could imply some complications in designing and testing the exact
interactions that you need for effective *self-replicating* factories,
which Drexler and others have theorized as necessary for the most
generally programmable kinds of construction. If there is no "trim to
fit" that could mean a lot of assemblies and sub-assemblies to quickly
build one another into a self replicating system over all? Or, maybe it
*wouldn't* take so much overhead for self-replication? It's hard to
judge in general, with natural living systems being the main existence
proof for this sort of thing. Also, early nanotech might not be
tremendously programmable, nor might it be much like robots building
robots, nor like a cell dividing, even. Instead, the earliest nanotech
might be more of a chemical trick of self-assembly, molecular strands
locking into one another. Living cells make use of something like this
when proteins fold (particular stretches of a protein attract to make
the protein fold a given way).

All of which brings me to the point that nanoparts shouldn't ever wear
out, just as a result of working in a well built nanomachine (this is
most closely related to John Clark's point #3). This is a great
advantage when it comes time to build large machine systems. For
instance, if you tried building a replicating factory from Legos, you
would likely run into the problem of the Legos wearing out at least a
bit, not snapping together so well, maybe wearing out more than a bit
too, as the most often used construction gadgets finally began to make
some headway on the replication problem. With molecular gadgets, not
only would there be no wear, the parts would have much less mass, and
could hence be made to move towards a useful result (like replicating)
much faster. So one thing that's motivated me to comment on this is that
John sort of missed what may be the two biggest reasons for expecting
results from nanotech, namely:

1. "No Wear", and

2.  "Speed of assembly of low mass parts" (being relatively speedy for
nano-based parts, compared to virtually anything else, especially given
the "No Wear" property, which is unique to nanotech, as far as I can
tell).

Oh, and just as a final thought, or analogy of sorts, consider that
practically every farm has a fancy gadget that you could compare to an
enzyme, namely the baler for packaging grass into winter cattle feed. A
baler gobbles up a bunch of stuff, presses it together in a small space
where it can't get away and out pops a pre-determined shape -- now,
that's a lot like what a chemical enzyme does to atoms! Just a thought,
so long for now.

That's okay.  I moved my estimate from 2030 to 2020 to 2010, so it all
balances out.

Interesting analysis as always, Corwyn!

When thinking of how the changed technological and economical climate
has affected the environmentalist movement, it makes sense to think
about how it has affected transhumanism. Compare the transhumanism of
the 80's and early 90's with today, and you see many changes there
too. The old megascale projects and grand space colonisation plans
have been replaced by bottom-up nanotech and infotech processes, just
to point at an obvious example.

One could argue that the religionising of the environment is the
result of many people being spoiled to some extent by a long period of
peace, prosperity and good environment - it is always possible to
demand a bit more than we have right now, and it often seems
reasonable. Especially when people are not aware of the complex web of
economic, social and technological relations that make up our society.
Why have all those nasty nuclear power plants when we have electricity
in the wall socket?

I think transhumanism can do a great deal of good by pointing at these
interrelations, making people realise that they cannot have (say)
advanced medicine without genetic engineering or a complex chemical
infrastructure or their favorite foreign foods without a globalised
market (or introduced species at home). This is the practical part,
but we should not be afraid of dealing with the ethical/spiritual side
too - we must be able to make a convincing argument for the ethics of
our ideas.  Let's remind people that we are not just children of
Mother Earth but of Father Sun too - and in the long run we might want
to visit him.

The world wide web has not been legislated as a forum to be considered "free
speech" by definition under the bill of rights. An email thread, message
board or web content can be monitored by it's webmasters or initiators. I
have a email thread (nanotech@onelist.com ) in which I can approve (or not)
any incoming message before it is posted. I can also go into my message
board, and delete anything I want at any time. (I haven't needed to do this
in any of these forums, but it is an available option) My point? If you're
online, 'censoring free speech' is a relative term. There are even several
cases where sites have been instructed to be taken down and content be
removed. These are issues that technology has advanced beyond the current
legal standings, and how these are dealt with are yet to be seen.
However, the internet, is _not_ exempt from the current laws regarding
slander.

OK its obvious to me that this troll just wants to waste our time and our 
bandwidth with the expected backlash that will follow from his posts.  Do 
what you want, but after this post I vow not to honor his baiting tactics 
with any further response.

Maybe things are looking up for gene therapy!

Maybe Hans has shifted his estimate into the future by yet another decade,
then (it's hard to tell from the brief article). In MIND CHILDREN it was
2030. In ROBOT, 2040.

Below is a request originally posted to a Tissue Culture list I'm on.  I'm
passing it on to this list, since there's been some interest here in GM
plants.

Barbara

========================================================

Forest Research (a forestry related scientific organistaion) in New Zealand
has applied to ERMA New Zealand (Environmental Risk Management Authority)
for approval to conduct two contained field trial experiments of transgenic
radiata pine and spruce in Rotorua, New Zealand. The summaries and the full
text of the applications can be obtained from ERMA (www.ermanz.govt.nz) or
from
Christian Walter (christian.walter@forestresearch.co.nz).
The  participatory democracy advocate web site
have developed a website and electronic
submission form that allows any interested party or individual to make
submissions to the applications.
We would appreciate support for these applications from the scientific
community world wide making supporting submissions (see website mentioned
below) to ERMA (deadline is August 30, 2000).
I'd like to point out that the comments made on the website are implying
that the field trial is in association with forestry companies and
multinationals. This is not correct. The field trials are fully funded by
reserach funds provided by the New Zealand Government.

Many thanks for your support.

To tell you the truth, I found this to be quite interesting as well.  As
much as I respect Hans, and as much as I enjoyed the article, I would still
opt to agree more with his _Mind Children_ prediction of 2030.  By that
time, Moore's Law should have been shattered to a considerable extent, and
de Garis' work on neural networks should have reached the human brainpower
stage.  

Still, the farther off you make "predictions" when talking to the general
public, the less likely you'll be considered a "kook" in public eyes.

While it may seem belated, I'm inspired today to comment on John Clark's
"6 reasons for nanotech to work more easily than macrotech":

This is a really good point, and a major reason to expect good economy
from nanomanufacturing. However, one has to be just a little bit
cautious about the idea of replicating things from cheap atoms. For
instance, to get a useful feed stock for nanofactories you'd have to
purify some sort of construction material, a material such as an
alcohol, for instance. Uncontrolled impurities could "poison" your
construction machines, bonding with things in such a way as to spoil
your project. Also, people love to talk about mining incredibly diluted
elements (like gold) from sea water. However, if you have to concentrate
things too much, the energy cost may be worth more than the market value
of what you've mined, even with the help of nano-built systems for
getting the energy.

Before, Dan Fabulich responded that programmed nanoconstruction might
actually involve the assembly of many kind of blocks, or "chunks" at
many different levels. Any real experts out there, game to engage in
relative parts counting exercises? Didn't someone mention that Robert
Freitas had something positive to say about this?

Better to say that atoms can't be damaged by mere handling, but that
radiation damage is a general concern. Also, see my comment on the
*wearing out* of parts, below.

Atoms have the premade, dependable, sizes and characteristics that
Nature provides for them. I'm not sure though, if this is an advantage,
or more of a neutral thing? Dependability is good, other times though,
you might wish you could trim to fit!

This could imply some complications in designing and testing the exact
interactions that you need for effective *self-replicating* factories,
which Drexler and others have theorized as necessary for the most
generally programmable kinds of construction. If there is no "trim to
fit" that could mean a lot of assemblies and sub-assemblies to quickly
build one another into a self replicating system over all? Or, maybe it
*wouldn't* take so much overhead for self-replication? It's hard to
judge in general, with natural living systems being the main existence
proof for this sort of thing. Also, early nanotech might not be
tremendously programmable, nor might it be much like robots building
robots, nor like a cell dividing, even. Instead, the earliest nanotech
might be more of a chemical trick of self-assembly, molecular strands
locking into one another. Living cells make use of something like this
when proteins fold (particular stretches of a protein attract to make
the protein fold a given way).

All of which brings me to the point that nanoparts shouldn't ever wear
out, just as a result of working in a well built nanomachine (this is
most closely related to John Clark's point #3). This is a great
advantage when it comes time to build large machine systems. For
instance, if you tried building a replicating factory from Legos, you
would likely run into the problem of the Legos wearing out at least a
bit, not snapping together so well, maybe wearing out more than a bit
too, as the most often used construction gadgets finally began to make
some headway on the replication problem. With molecular gadgets, not
only would there be no wear, the parts would have much less mass, and
could hence be made to move towards a useful result (like replicating)
much faster. So one thing that's motivated me to comment on this is that
John sort of missed what may be the two biggest reasons for expecting
results from nanotech, namely:

1. "No Wear", and

2.  "Speed of assembly of low mass parts" (being relatively speedy for
nano-based parts, compared to virtually anything else, especially given
the "No Wear" property, which is unique to nanotech, as far as I can
tell).

Oh, and just as a final thought, or analogy of sorts, consider that
practically every farm has a fancy gadget that you could compare to an
enzyme, namely the baler for packaging grass into winter cattle feed. A
baler gobbles up a bunch of stuff, presses it together in a small space
where it can't get away and out pops a pre-determined shape -- now,
that's a lot like what a chemical enzyme does to atoms! Just a thought,
so long for now.

That's okay.  I moved my estimate from 2030 to 2020 to 2010, so it all
balances out.

Interesting analysis as always, Corwyn!

When thinking of how the changed technological and economical climate
has affected the environmentalist movement, it makes sense to think
about how it has affected transhumanism. Compare the transhumanism of
the 80's and early 90's with today, and you see many changes there
too. The old megascale projects and grand space colonisation plans
have been replaced by bottom-up nanotech and infotech processes, just
to point at an obvious example.

One could argue that the religionising of the environment is the
result of many people being spoiled to some extent by a long period of
peace, prosperity and good environment - it is always possible to
demand a bit more than we have right now, and it often seems
reasonable. Especially when people are not aware of the complex web of
economic, social and technological relations that make up our society.
Why have all those nasty nuclear power plants when we have electricity
in the wall socket?

I think transhumanism can do a great deal of good by pointing at these
interrelations, making people realise that they cannot have (say)
advanced medicine without genetic engineering or a complex chemical
infrastructure or their favorite foreign foods without a globalised
market (or introduced species at home). This is the practical part,
but we should not be afraid of dealing with the ethical/spiritual side
too - we must be able to make a convincing argument for the ethics of
our ideas.  Let's remind people that we are not just children of
Mother Earth but of Father Sun too - and in the long run we might want
to visit him.

Well, for anyone from Britain here who was around in the late 70's/early
80's, they might remember a character from a TV called "Saphire & Steel".
Was Sci-Fi if I remember correctly.  I'm pretty sure the name was John Steel.

The character Steel was played by Robert McCallum, of "Man from Uncle" fame.

I just read this carefully. It says you KNOW Keith is guilty and then tried to implicate Max.

Oops. Now you just said, "in other words". You don't actually know. You said heard from someone who made an accusation. You also said you are "suspicious and curious". You are a rumor monger at best. If you don't know
the difference between fact and second hand information, what the hell are you doing on this list?

I for one do not understand how you could not have foreseen the "fury" that you created.  To not foresee the reaction appears to me to be the height of ignorance, when it is obvious that many of the individuals on the list are colleagues/Friends or at lea
st admire Mr. More and the things he has accomplished.  This is after all the extropian mailing list, and the Extropy institute was in fact started by Max More.  If it is not ignorance on your part then it demonstrates a frightening lack of empathy to be 
so surprised at the reactions.

The action that you took was simply mean spirited, and could serve no redeeming purpose.  I read your statement and I am sorry if you do not see it but it is tantamount to accusing an individual that we respect of a heinous crime.  Not only was it rude of
 you to do so, it was extremely innappropriate.  Imagine if in a public forum someone accused you of (random horrific act inserted here).

>If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...

This is a ridiculous request.  Yes or No "Mr. Miller", have you stopped beating your wife?  Your tactics are cheap and insulting, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  If the best you can come up with is rumor then you ought to keep silent.  If you ha
ve evidence (which you stated that you have none) then you ought to go to the police.  Any other action is nothing more than a poor attempt at a smear campaign.

I for one have no respect for you or your tactics Jamiro.
It is for this reason I have chosen not to respond to your unfounded accusation in regards to Mr. More, and have instead only spoken to your tactics.


John Calvin

Remember when technology was the best friend of most of the mainstream 
environmentalist movement?  New crops would limit the amount of farmland
needed.  Solar power (and even nuclear power) would reduce our reliance upon
polluting coal and oil.  Maglev trains would make nosy, fuel-guzzling 
aircraft obsolete.  Increased understanding of ecology was going to allow us
to clean up polluted sites and held up better manage and protect endangered
species.

well, what has changed?  "No new rail" cry environmentalist groups in the Bay
Area.  "Frankenfoods" cry environmentalists in Europe.  Signs protesting 
technology at all levels have been seen amongst the protesters outside the WTO
meeting, the World Bank meeting, and the RNC and DNC gatherings in Philadelphia
and Los Angeles.  Ted Kazcinski (sp?) is slowly becoming what he most wanted
to be and what msot peopel scoffed at him ever becoming: a role model, an
architect of what is increasingly becoming the manifesto of the neo-Luddite 
movement.

When and where did we lose ground, and how can we remedy this situation?  I'd
begin by saying that many of the technological solutions have been poorly 
implemented, overhyped, and require a lot of social reengineering to be 
plausible on the scale they were sold for.  Economic realities have sapped
the urgency of some of the broadest-reaching but expensive "green" 
technologies.  And finally, a combination of success in environmental causes
and a growing  retrospiritual movement has led to the "religionizing" of the
Left.

Environmentalism is becoming more f a religion than a sociopolitical thought,
at least organized environmentalism.  The initial arguement against GM foods,
for example, is the questions it poses for vegetarians, partticulaly those
who have spiritual reasons for not eating meat - how many animal genes must
be in something before it is considered an animal?  Also amongst 
environmentalists, the notion of corporations as evil, and technologists as
simply handmaidens for "corporate greed" (are these two words even separable
anymore?) is accepted axiomatically.  In the eyes of most environmentalists, 
ANY technology is evil, and will eventually aid and abet the "pave the earth"
mentality, regardless o fhow "green" it may seem.

The economic reality of the world has changed since the 1970s.  OPEc seems 
unwilling to play the sort of embargo games that gave the green technology 
movement such a boost in the 1970s.  Growth in affluence, especially in the 
United States, has led consumers to accept higher energy costs as a simple
fact of life - there is no clamouring for a new clean technology in a world
where 8 MPG SUVs are a status symbol.  Unfortunately, with the slowly lowering
costs of energy and steel and other manufacturing goods, green technologies 
cannot really compete economically.  And without price pressures to look for an
alternative, certain key technologies (i.e. batteries) are moving slowly.

Unforutnately, green technology was also oversold, without taking into account 
certain social values that make it difficult to implement.  Take, for example,
rail.  Maglev rail has not really taken off as a means of moving people outside
of certain runs in Europe and in Japan, both places where society is less
car and space-oriented.  In the United States, the "American Dream" still 
involves owning a private home in the suburbs, far away from the noise, bustle
and crime of the cities.  Unfortunately, this has led to suburban sprawl, which
is extremely inefficient for rail travel.  Additionally, after airline 
deregulation, in addition to the lowered cost of fuel, aircraft tickets  have 
become cheaper in real terms than hey were during the 1970s, for most 
domestic flights in the US.

Fortunately, most of the public does not yet buy into the Fundamentalist Left's
ideas of what environmentalism is.  There is still room to combat this image,
and promote a more rational environmentalism, where technology is a key part.
I would say we have little choice; it won't be long before there is a movement
to ban all space launches because of the pollution caused by rocket engines.

Read your own writing. You are specifically NOT saying that these are
allegations, nor are you posting your sources. You are making claims as to
actual facts. To claim that you are not doing so is a lie.

No, you said "I know", not "I've read reports" or "I've seen allegations". These
are very different things. You also say 'are guilty', not 'alleged'. These are
also very different things.

Free speech does not include the right to scream FIRE in a theater.

Unjustly accusing a person of a despicable crime is one of the cardinal sins of
our civilization. Since we know Max, and you, as far as we are concerned, are
absolutely nobody, it is you upon whom the outrage rests and the burden of proof
lies.

Bullshit. If it was unintentional, then you must be functionally illiterate with
the IQ of a casava melon.

Ah bullshit again. You're just trying to keep the friggin thing going. 

Here's some info about where this Bozo is posting from, and the relatively close
proximity of significant Scientologist facilities:

2 miles away:
HGB, the Hollywood Guarranty  Building, a twelve story office building at
Hollywood Boulevard and Ivar formerly owned by the Bank of America. It is an old
building that was constructed in the 1920s and purchased by Scientology with
cash in the mid-'80s. All International management (upper middle management
above continents and below *INT* - see Int) is located in this building. It is a
twenty minute walk from the Cedars Complex, and houses IHELP, OSA Int, and the
CMO IXU (Internal eXtension Unit), WISE Int, ABLE Int, and more. The various
orgs on different floors in 1993 looked like this: 12th floor - OSA Int

It seems to me as though there is significant support for the Co$ theory. There
is no listing at www.whitepages.com for a 'Jamrio Miller', though there are a
number of 'J Miller' listings in the Hollywood area. There is a James R Miller
in the 90024 zip code.

Here is a challenge: retract your statement in its entirety, and post the
'trusted sources' you claim are making the accusations so that they may be
examined as any evidence properly should be.

There is a very fascinating company called "Tools for Wellness"(formerly "Tools for Exploration") who have a large and amazing array of products to develop and expand the mind and body.  Some of these products seem very worth investigating while others are merely "snake oil."  So, you must use your own best judgement as you peruse the website.  Still, the catalog should catch on fire the interest and imagination of any extropian interested in the boundless possibilities of human potential.  I have poured over their catalogs for years now.  I look forward to what list members would have to say regarding what they see.  I recommend you each order online a free catalog to be sent to you in the mail.

Ah ... finally, a productive thread! Thanks Corwyn, Anders.

While I would shy away from Corwyn's term "Fundamentalist Left (term is 
baiting, reactionary) I have a real hard time with the schism in the common 
green thinking:

I was having a discussion with a very talented and passionate artist about 
genetic food. Worried about the non-reproductive seeds and the effect on 
farmers in third world countries. The y don't like Monsanto, don't trust the 
motive for making the non-reproductive corn. OK, I respect that. That's 
against LIFE! Concern the non-reproductive seeds will make the farmers 
dependent on the company. OK I respect that, check your research, etc.... But 
then - she says: And, genetically engineered HUMANS ... that would be worse, 
why in India, now that they can genetically engineer the SEX of the baby, 
they're all gonna ask for BOYS. and begins a rant on sexism in the third 
world, Afghanistan, etc., and how this will escalate it.

So I say the obvious to all of us here: Look! Engineers and technology are 
not to blame for the horrible treatment of women -- in fact they are great 
equalizers -- it is fundamental religion that is responsible for much of the 
degradation and segregation (for example Afghanistan) - and the origin of all 
this misogynistic attitude towards baby girls, isn't it? 
Hey, I see protest for all sorts of technology and warfare, but when it comes 
to protesting horribly oppressive religion, which is the cause of most of the 
wars and torture, where are all you so called "caring" people? Why don't the 
masses turn out to violently protest these outdated horrors - if you want to 
talk about 'against LIFE!' 

She admitted it, you are right Nadia, we do not criticize come one's 
SPIRITUAL beliefs, that is taboo. Hmm... 

I sort of don't think she's gonna act on it. 

It's not that the left is religious, I don't see it that way. What we 
culturally are, left, center, out to lunch and/or right, is scared and overly 
polite regarding that taboo subject. The sacred cow. It's some kind of 
freakish phenomenon built right into the religion meme.

It is part of the durability factor.

You work at http://www.wildghost.com is stunning -- full of rich visuals

It did take a bit of time to fully open the lead-in page, but the music was
worth listening to.  My first impression was that Internet users will
continue to see more of the video/filmic arts on the Internet and that your
site is a step beyond the usual graphics of Web sites.  This is good, but
can be disturbing to viewers who just want the facts.  I prefer to use the
Internet's display pages as a visual/audio communications art.

I'll be taking my second session of Flash4 in a couple of weeks, I can read
between the lines a bit, and your work is nicely advanced with a
contemporary spin on topography and layout.

I hope it brings you much success!

Less than 10 years? I'd be surprised if it was that soon, but then,whenever it does come
it will be as a big surprise to most, otherwise it wouldn't be a singularity.

I'm working on a British documentary today for Discovery Channel on "Raw
Beauty", or more recently titled "Science of Beauty."

If anyone has any suggestions for the future of physical beauty, mental
aesthetics, or any area of the science of perceptions of beauty and
recognition, please send me your comments for inclusion!

I'd really appreciate input from the technological and scientific oriented
extropians and other transhumanists.

I will be focusing on transhumans and posthumans.  Here is some of my topics:

			* * * * * * * * * * * *

As cogently as possible from general to specific:

(A.)	Extropic Art - genre of art that is an aesthetic take on the future.
	(1.)	Automorph Art - shaping the self.
		(a.)	Technologies:  nanotechnology, AI, genetic engineering,
human/computer interfaces, virtual reality, virtual selves.
			(i.)	Physical beauty:  outer appearance, emotional appearance. Changing
body and brain to extend our lives.


(A.)  	My thoughts stem around the art concept of Extropic Art which
incorporates the aesthetics, the science and the technologies of
superlongevity.  

	My deep interest in pursuing knowledge about life extension sciences and
technologies is steered by a practical optimism.  It is essential to
continue evolutionary advances by using technology to extend life, augment
intelligence, optimize psychology, and improve social systems.  We are
changing and we will continue to acquire greater capabilities with which to
enjoy our lives and the universe around us.  In doing so, I find it
advantageous to challenge conventional thinking about human limits and
think about how technologies will improve our future.  The footnote here is
that attempting to change conventional thinking requires both sensibility
and understanding.  Many people find it difficult to adapt to new ways of
thinking, especially when it involves biotechnology.  Rather than alienate
those who question the ethics or the direction of science and technology, I
try to understand opposing views and deal with information on advanced
technologies and their positive potentials, their challenges, and their
possible dangers.  

	Thus, the concept is to seek the continuation and acceleration of the
evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human form and limits.
The integration of technology seems to be a positive way to do this as
evidenced by any heart transplant and prosthetic limb.  

	(1.)  Automorph  Art is the Extropic Art of consciously and
comprehensively sculpting one's physiology and psychology.   The focus of
Automorph Art is shaping appearance, the mind, feelings, intellect,
identity to make one's whole self an object of beauty, not just physical
appearance, although this is part of it. (general philosophy)

		(a.)	In explaining what this means:  shaping entire identity:  physical
appearance, identify, emotions.  This will be enabled by new technologies:
nanotechnology, genetic engineering, computer interfaces.  The technologies
that will make this a reality.  

			(i.)  Physical possibilities:  superlongevity.  The particular is the
physical beauty.  

			Stress the uniqueness of using advanced technologies to alter ourselves
in ways not possible before.  If we are not psychologically beautiful, we
can alter our brain and our genes.  To be ethically beautiful by shaping
psychology and behavior through modifying psychology by responding with
emotional refinement.  (Rewiring the way the brain works.)  Put in context
that beauty is more than skin deep.  I take this very seriously.  Beauty is
the whole self and by sculpting the whole self, one can be dimensionally
beautiful.  Aesthetic means healthy, vigorous, strong, elegant.


In summation:  If we can choose what our individual beauty is: we can
determine what we want to look like and such is my perspective about beauty
and superlongevity.  

Further, my future body design Primo 3M+ is an artistic vision of what
types of changes could be made to alter our bodies (located at
http://www.extropic-art.com/aesthetics2.htm: 
 
** 20th Century Body 
limited life span 
inherited genes
wears out
random mistakes
intelligence capacity 100 trillion synapses 
single tracks circuits   
gender restricted    
prone to environmental damage     
corrosion by irritability, envy, depression  
elimination messy and gaseous waste  

** Primo 3M+ 
ageless
replaceable genes
upgradable
error correction device
intelligence capacity 100 quadrillion synapses 
multiple viewpoints running on parallel 
gender changeability
environmentally friendly
turbocharged optimism
recycles and purifies waste products

This, of course, is a conceptual project, but not too far off from what may
occur in the future.  This mock up design would put good use to
nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and artificial intelligence with
prosthetic parts and augmentations.

				* * * * * * * * *

Thanks,
Natasha

What do we mean by "brainpower"? When psychologists give IQ tests they
measure the result/product/solution of mental ability. These products
occur in domains like those of reasoning, memory, spatial-visual and
verbal. We can draw profiles now to compare the best of the mind children
with the best of their creators. At least in chess the mind children
win. How about the other measured products of intelligence?

Impressive site, Jason.  I would suggest (along the lines of Natasha's
comments) that on your opening page you provide an alternative path for low
bandwidth users.

  THE invisible man has come one step closer: scientists believe they have

By manipulating the way light passes through tissue, a team at the
University of Texas at Austin has moved into what was once the realm of
science fiction. The engineers say they can create a temporary "window" in
tissue, allowing doctors to see up to five times deeper than at present over
an area of up to one or two square inches.

Although the technique has not yet been tested on human skin, the engineers
believe it could have applications in diagnosis; helping to reveal the
extent of skin cancer, for example, and in treatment, by allowing a laser
beam to be targeted on underlying tissue.

By injecting various substances, the team made small areas of rat or hamster
skin nearly transparent for 20 minutes or more. Prof Ashley Welch, the lead
investigator, said: "We could see a blood vessel which had not been
visible." Light does not usually penetrate skin because it is scattered,
like a torch beam in fog.

Just as each water droplet in the fog scatters light, so small components of
tissue also scatter light. To overcome this, his team used glycerol, a
hygroscopic alcohol which pulls water out of tissue. The team has yet to
look into the toxicity of the technique, which Prof Welch admitted was "an
important question".

Nice observation, Mike- I just added a mail filter that looks for that
line and trashes the dupes, so I won't have to wade through 'em.  I
suppose you've sent him an email asking him to stop?

Their first priority would probably center on creating better genetic engineers.

At least in Netscrape, you can add a new message header "Delivered-To"
and then search for babinsky in that header.  This will allow you to
remove all the duplicates, or filter out new occurances (although it
seems to have stopped).

Draw an imaginary profile of humanoid mental ability vs. human mental
ability if you were to use the state-of-the-art technology now with no
budgetary restrictions. Then we'll see who wins the case of root beer.

Probably not.
Check this out:

Expert: US Open To Bioterrorism

     WASHINGTON (AP) _ Advances in technology make the United States
more vulnerable to bioterrorism than to nuclear attack, a leading
expert in defending against biological weapons said Tuesday.
    Dr. Tara O'Toole, deputy director of Johns Hopkins University's
Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, suggested devoting $30
billion over the next 10 years to prepare health care systems to
detect, track, respond and contain epidemics that would be
triggered by biological weapons.
    The Department of Health and Human Services says it is spending
$278 million this fiscal year to prepare for bioterrorism.
    ``The likelihood of a biological weapon being used is a lot
higher than a missile coming across the Pacific,'' O'Toole said.
``And yet we are spending a lot more on missile defense than we are
on biological systems.''
    ``A bio Unibomber is perfectly possible, and that threat will
grow because of the growing power of biotechnology and genomics,''
she said in a discussion at the independent Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
    Spurred by the spread of computers, the Internet and large
corporations searching for medical miracles, biotechnical advances
are moving much faster than physics did in the 1950s, O'Toole said.
    Genetic research to develop new drugs could ``create the tools
to build a more powerful weapon and virulent bug,'' she said.
    Simple devices such as a nasal spray could spread a deadly
disease such as anthrax, underscoring the difficulty of detecting
biological weapons before their use.
    O'Toole said the United States needs to strengthen its public
health and medical care system to deal with biological attacks
because this would ``probably make ourselves less attractive
targets to would-be perpetrators.''
    A byproduct of such an effort, she said, would be an improvement
in the everyday functioning of hospitals and other health care
systems, because new medical devices and treatments would be
developed.
    O'Toole recommended a robust research and development program to
reduce vulnerability to biological weapons using resources of the
departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.
    ``We've also got to engage the genius of the universities, the
pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies, who are not now
in this game,'' she said. ``They are not running around looking for
cures for anthrax. There is no market reason to do so.''
    The research program should focus on three areas, she
recommended:
    _Developing an automated means to diagnose disease-causing
organisms by using microchips.
    _Producing better vaccines, more vaccines and new antibiotics
and particularly anti-viral drugs for likely bioagents.
    _Enhancing immune response generally ``so we can get `one-bug,
one-drug' and see if we can find a more all-purpose way to limit
our susceptibility to infectious disease.''
    Public health experts have warned for several years that
bioterrorism, the release of deadly bacteria or viruses, is a
growing threat. While the government knows how to respond to
chemical spills or bombings, bioterrorism could be the ultimate
sneak attack: no one would know it had happened until sick people
began arriving at hospitals.
    It's not a theoretical risk. In 1985, a cult sickened 750 people
by poisoning salad bars in Oregon with the food-poisoning germ
salmonella. In 1995, experts say Japanese doomsday cultists tried
but failed to release botulism toxin and anthrax in Tokyo. The same
cult later released nerve gas into a subway and killed 12 people
and made thousands sick.

Naw, you know me. I'm not that nice. ;) I was actually hoping someone else would
take this info to the next logical step, or that maybe this observation was
irrelevant.

It is very difficult to pass these concepts out to the public while maintaining
the vital context.  To have the power to solve complex problems we need a
combination of processing units, and an effective arrangement of such units.
Back in the 50's people observed that it was unreasonable to expect to build a
computer out of millions of vacuum tubes (the basic units of processing) to rival
the human brain, even if only a tiny fraction of the neurons of the brain were
needed to do thinking.  This is a strong argument, even though it does not really
prove anything.  It may be possible to reproduce the problem solving power of the
brain with just the right arrangement of vastly fewer processing units.

As time has gone on, the number of artificial processing units has grown
exponentially.  At the same time, biologists have found vastly more cellular
processing activity.  The point of all this is not to say that when the
artificial processing capability exceeds the cellular processing capability we
will have intelligent machines, but rather, that at that point the "we will never
have an equivalent number of vacuum tubes" argument goes away.  This is the
removal of a negative, not necessarily the demonstration of a positive.

Although we want to jump to the ultimate conclusion, what Moravec is actually
saying is that the extrapolations of the trends show that soon you will have one
less reason for calling his work "unreasonable."  It does not say anything about
when we will, or will not, have intelligent machines.

  Revista Medica de Chile.  127(3):286-94, 1999 Mar.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a new cholesterol lowering agent
  derived from sugar cane. AIM: To compare the cholesterol lowering efficacy of
  policosanol with HMG CoA inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
  Patients with a LDL cholesterol over 160 mg/dl were studied. If, after 6
  weeks of diet, cholesterol persisted elevated, they were doubly blind
  randomized to receive policosanol 10 mg/day (55 patients),
  lovastatin 20 mg/day (26 patients) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (25 patients).
  Serum cholesterol was measured again after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS:
  Initial demographic and laboratory data were similar among treatment groups.
  A 24% LDL cholesterol reduction was obtained with
  policosanol, compared with a 22% reduction with lovastatin
  and a 15% reduction with simvastatin. HDL cholesterol significantly increased
  in patients on policosanol and did not change in the other
  treatment groups. Adverse effects of policosanol were mild
  and unspecific. No changes in hepatic enzymes were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
  Policosanol is a safe and effective cholesterol reducing
  agent.

  Effects of policosanol in patients with type II
  hypercholesterolemia and additional coronary risk factors.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
  tolerability of policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering
  drug, in patients with type II hypercholesterolemia and additional coronary
  risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 5 weeks of a standard step-1
  lipid-lowering diet, 437 patients were randomized to receive, under
  double-blind conditions, 5 mg policosanol or placebo once a
  day with the evening meal for 12 weeks and 10 mg policosanol
  or placebo for the next 12 weeks. RESULTS: Both groups were similar at
  randomization. Policosanol (5 and 10 mg/day) significantly
  reduced (P < .001) serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (18.2% and
  25.6%, respectively) and cholesterol (13.0% and 17.4%), and it significantly
  raised (P < .01) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.5% and 28.4%).
  Triglycerides remained unchanged after the first 12 weeks and lowered
  significantly (5.2%; P < .01) at study completion.
  Policosanol was safe and well tolerated, and no drug-related
  disturbances were observed. Two male patients who received placebo died
  during the study--one because of a myocardial infarction and the other
  because of a cardiac arrest that occurred during a surgical intervention.
  There were 11 serious adverse events (5.1%) in 10 patients who received
  placebo (4.6%), 7 of which were vascular, compared with no serious adverse
  events reported in patients receiving policosanol (P < .01).
  CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in the group treated with policosanol
  did not have serious adverse events during the 24-week study. This study
  shows that policosanol is effective, safe, and well
  tolerated in patients with hypercholesterolemia and concomitant coronary risk
  factors.

Title
  A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of
  policosanol in patients with intermittent claudication.
Source
  Angiology.  50(2):123-30, 1999 Feb.
Abstract
  This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
  policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering drug with
  concomitant antiplatelet effects, in patients with intermittent claudication.
  After a baseline period of 6 weeks, 62 patients were randomized to receive,
  under double-blind conditions, either placebo (31 patients) or
  policosanol (31), 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances in a
  treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees) were assessed before
  and after 6 months of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization.
  Policosanol increased significantly (p < 0.01) the initial
  claudication distance from 132.5+/-13.5 m (baseline) to 205.7+/-36.3 m (after
  therapy) and the absolute claudication distance (p<0.0001) from 229.5+/-22.0
  m to 365.4+/-46.9 m; meanwhile both variables remained unchanged in the
  placebo group (p<0.05). The reduction of lower limb symptoms showed a greater
  benefit in the policosanol group. There was no significant
  change in either group in the ankle/arm pressure ratio. The treatment was
  well tolerated. There were 10 discontinuations (seven placebo, three
  policosanol) from the study. Six withdrawals occurred
  because of adverse events (AE); all were in placebo patients. There were five
  serious vascular AEs in the placebo group but none in the
  policosanol group (p<0.05). Overall, 12/31 (38.7%) placebo
  patients and 3/31 (9.7%) policosanol patients experienced
  AEs after randomization, which showed a lesser incidence of AEs in the
  policosanol group (p<0.01). The present study demonstrates a
  beneficial effect of policosanol in patients with
  intermittent claudication.

Title
  Effect of policosanol on intimal thickening in rabbit cuffed
  carotid artery.
Source
  International Journal of Cardiology.  67(2):125-32, 1998 Dec 1.
Abstract
  We studied the effect of policosanol on smooth muscle cell
  proliferation in the cuffed carotid artery of the rabbit.
  Policosanol is a mixture of higher aliphatic primary
  alcohols isolated from sugar cane wax, with cholesterol lowering effects
  proved in experimental models and patients with type II hypercholesterolemia.
  It acts by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. The positioning of a
  nonocclusive silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery results in the
  formation of a neointima. We wished to determine whether
  policosanol orally administered prevented intimal
  thickening. Collars were placed around the left carotid for 15 days. The
  contralateral artery was sham operated. We included three experimental
  groups: a control received vehicle and two others
  policosanol at 5 and 25 mg Kg until sacrificed. Samples of
  arteries were examined by light and electron microscopy. To evaluate intimal
  thickening the cross-sectional area of intima and media were measured.
  Neointima was significantly reduced in policosanol-treated
  animals compared with controls. The smooth muscle cell proliferation was
  studied by the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen and a significant reduction was observed in
  policosanol treated rabbits. It is concluded that
  policosanol has a protective effect on the neointima
  formation in this experimental model.

Title
  Long-term therapy with policosanol improves treadmill
  exercise-ECG testing performance of coronary heart disease patients.
Source
  International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics.  36(9):469-73,
  1998 Sep.
Abstract
  This study examined the effects of long-term lipid-lowering therapy with
  policosanol on the clinical evolution, and exercise-ECG
  testing responses of 45 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with myocardial
  ischemia, documented by exercise 201T1-myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, in
  an overall randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, made for
  different test endpoints. Fifteen patients were treated with 5 mg of
  policosanol twice daily; another 15 patients were
  administered the same drug dose plus 125 mg aspirin; and the other 15
  patients received placebo plus equal aspirin dose. They were followed for 20
  months, previous baseline observations, with treadmill exercise-ECG, besides
  serum lipid test. Beneficial changes on proportions among the 2
  policosanol groups and the placebo group, showed an
  increment on functional capacity class, a decrement on rest and exercise
  angina, and a significant decrease in cardiac events, and in ischemic ST
  segment response, especially in the policosanol plus aspirin
  group (p = 0.05, X2(2df) = 5.8; p = 0.04, p = 0.02; Fisher). After treatment,
  sets of mean changes revealed an increase on maximum oxygen uptake, and a
  decline on double product simultaneously in both policosanol
  groups (p < or = 0.02, p < or = 0.002; Pillais, Hotellings' T2), while the
  placebo group was impaired. Aerobic functional capacity percent showed an
  increment in policosanol groups (p < or = 0.05, paired T).
  Lipid levels improved as other endpoints already reported. A supposed
  ergogenic effect of octacosanol, policosanol's main active
  compound, was not detected with this design. These results show that
  policosanol-treated CHD patients improved clinical
  evolution, and exercise-ECG responses, owing to the amelioration of
  myocardial ischemia, even more when administered with aspirin.

OK, then how well can we design humanoid robots to come up with the
solutions or answers? (The end justifies the means when it comes to
humanoid philosophy). In which cases are humanoids inferior to humans and
in which cases are they superior when it comes to delivering these
solutions/answers by whatever means?

I think it was FWP who was also a very lazy psychologist and
decided that it was better to wait for a smart robot slave to come along
than to try and use the rest of that brain capacity.

More importantly, we might ask how well we can immunize humans against the
stupidity of the church-temple-mosque, nation-state, corporation, family and
other entropy-oriented entities.
The fact that socialism derives from congenital selfishness doesn't help us, of
course. But knowing it at least warns us not to trust their ideologues,
demagogues, and theologues.

Speaking as someone with fingers in both the
human-intelligence-enhancement and Artificial Intelligence pies, I think
it makes tremendous sense to pursue AI at the expense of IE, and my
efforts have been focused on the former for some time.  Human IE - of
the kind I used to be interested in - means that you have to wait for
the kids to grow up before anything interesting happens, and that would
just take too long.

This is a silly little urban legend.

I have never heard any reputable source for this statement, and it is
both falsifiable and false.  Neuroanatomy has already assigned functions
to considerably more than 50% of the brain, as measured by weight,
volume, number of neurons, number of synapses, or any other standard you
care to name.  Heck, the visual systems alone account for around half of
the cerebral cortex.  I don't claim that we've found *all* the functions
for these pieces of neuroanatomy, but we do know they're not standing
idle.

As for the old line about 90% of the brain going unused, forget it. 
Nobody with the vaguest acquaintance with neurology could ever dream of
making such a statement.

Well, yes, Nadia, but--

Take a look at the places around the world where religious devotees do
vigorously dispute with each other. They don't engage in polite
discussions, they hack off limbs, blow each other up, teach their children
insane hatred. Obviously some of this is territorial defence/aggression
under an ideological mask, but a lot of it probably has to do with the way
religion enters into one's very definition of self and extended kin, of
deep-set die-for values. So there's a lot to be said for polite mutual
live&let live tolerance. In such a framework, you often find that the
overpowering intensity of irrational memes falls away, since their immune
defences aren't under invigorating threat. I escaped from Catholicism
because I was living in relaxed, multicultural Australia; if I'd been
raised in Northern Ireland, I'm not sure it would have been so
(comparatively) easy.

Ho hum.  A countercurrent heat exchanger and steam reformer, using
partial exhaust gas recirculation to provide the steam source.  It's
been done before, better, and the maintenance cost of cleaning the
sludge out of the volatilization chamber outweighs the convenience of
not needing to refine the fuel.  Contrary to the inventor's "no
pollution" claim, this thing would put out terrble amounts of sulfur
dioxide if operated on sour crudes- and sulphuric acid is *not* usable
as a fuel no matter what processing you do on it.

His "reactor rod" is merely a displacer to force the vapor to flow
through an annulus, providing better heat transfer.  Since this is a
central part of his patent, is could be circumvented by simply using a
different (but equally effective) heat exchanger geometry.

Yet another crank tinkerer.

oooookaaaaayyyyy...  Thanks for the site Terry.  Interesting,
but Ill hafta say its fulla baloney.

One thing that did kinda strike me tho, is that modern inventors
keep finding the same principles that the old timers discovered
way back in the early days of internal combustion.  Improving
heat exchange and energy scavenging at the exhaust will cause
a whole bunch of new problems to crop up.  spike

Granted I'm not on the "front lines" or anything (heck I ain't even on the 
battlefield), but the more I read the less optimistic I become.  My current 
estimate is circa '40.

I think you're almost certainly correct insofar as I suspect the issues are
not quite as straightforward as some of the guys drawing the graphs seem to
believe.

I'm sure we humans still have a few surprises in store for us in our quest
for engineered intelligence.  I don't think that anyone who knows anything
about the human computer will pretend that the answers are clear.

We project future innovation on the basis of current processes: this is
probably not a bad way to listen to the future, but I think it's clear that
we can't rule out major paradigm shifts or fundamental technical hurdles.

Reality doesn't know to follow the curve.

Currently the human computer -does- have logical limits on its ability to
think.  We are *just* of intelligence necessary to be considered smart here
folks-- we are just a single echelon above the higer primates.

Hey, don't get me wrong, it's a good echelon to be on.  It's a significant
step.

In fact, it's a great one-- I believe that we are just of the intelligence
necessary to realize the need for us to become more intelligent.

I hope it happens quickly, I do, but it's a little early in the game yet to
rule out catastrophic circumstances.

I wrote earlier:
Eli, I will bet you a case of your favorite brand of root beer 
that it will be at least 2020 before robots have the full cognitive 
power of a human being.  Though by 2010 there may be robots as smart as I am! lol 
(end)

I agree with Zero that 2040 is probably a good estimate of when we will see robots capable of matching or exceeding all human facets of intelligence.  Arthur C. Clarke in reexamining when AI would mature put the date also at 2040; so you are in good company.  

So, if Eli were to take me up on my bet I could be sipping A&W root beer a decade from now at his expense...  And of course I would share with Joel and Zero!

Apart from molecular weapons, it is remarkably hard to kill off
humanity sustainably. Even in a near extinction the population should
recover within few hundred years, and pick up the torch, as
documentation and artifacts will be aplenty.

Ah, sorry, bad choice of words on my part-- by 'catastrophic' I'm really
trying to point at the idea of a 'massively significant unforseen
circumstance,' such as (for instance) the sudden realization of fundamental
rules of reality that prevent us from easily moving intelligence to the next
level.

Perhaps, but your post would be in my dictionary right next to the "cold

     That's the way the money goes


               Illustration: Brett
               Rider


Life's so unfair. The rich get richer, while the rest of
 us just scrape by. Is society to blame or are deeper
       forces at work, asks Mark Buchanan 

WHY do rich people have all the money? This may sound like the world's
silliest question, but it's not. In every society, most of the wealth
falls into the hands of a minority. People often write this off as a
fact of life--something we can do nothing about--but economists have
always struggled to explain why the wealthy take such a big slice of
the pie.

If Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mézard are right, it is more than a
fact of life: it's a law of nature. These two scientists have
discovered a link between the physics of materials and the movements
of money, a link that explains why wealth is distributed in much the
same way in all modern economies. Their theory holds out a scrap of
hope to the poor of the world: there may be some surprising ways to
make society a bit more equal. And it promises a new fundamental
science of money.  Economic theory is about to grow up.

In the 19th century, economists were certain that each society would
have a unique distribution of wealth, depending on the details of its
economic structure. But they were dumbfounded in 1897 by the claim of
a Paris-born engineer named Vilfredo Pareto. The statistics, he
insisted, prove otherwise. Not only do a filthy-rich minority always
hog most of the wealth, but the mathematical form of the distribution
is the same everywhere.

To get a feel for Pareto's law, suppose that in Germany or Japan or
the US you count up how many people have, say, $10 000. Next, repeat
the count for many other values of wealth (W), both large and small,
and finally plot your results on a graph. You will find that there are
only a few extremely rich people, and that the number of people
increases as W gets smaller--at least until you get down to those with
almost no wealth at all. This is exactly what Pareto found: the number
of people having wealth W is proportional to 1/WE. Pareto found that
the exponent E was always between 2 and 3 (see Diagram) for every
European country he looked at, from agrarian Russia to industrial
England. And up-to-date statistics show the same thing.

This distribution means that most of the wealth gathers in the pockets
of a small fraction of the people. In the US, for example, 20 per cent
of the people own 80 per cent of the wealth. In Britain and in the
nations of Western Europe the numbers are similar. The shape of the
graph seems to be universal.

For over a century, this universal law of wealth distribution has
defied explanation, many economists simply putting it down to the
inherent distribution of people's abilities. The truth may be simpler.

Economic theories have for years been founded on all sorts of dubious
assumptions: that markets are in equilibrium, for example, or that
people behave with perfect rationality. These assump- tions simplify
economists' intricate equations, but they often lead to rather
peculiar conclusions. There is even a "no trades" theorem, says
Bouchaud, that in an economy where all the participants are perfectly
rational, no trade should ever take place. So Bouchaud and Mézard are
pioneering a totally different approach. They are going back to
basics, trying to get by with an absolute minimum of assumptions.

"Ten years ago," says Mézard, speaking from his office at Paris-Sud
University, "Jean-Philippe was one of the first physicists to get
interested in finance." Questioning many traditional ideas, he at
first met resistance. Since then, however, Bouchaud has built a
company dealing in risk management that has won the attention and
respect of the financial industry. Now at the Centre d'Etudes de
Saclay in Paris, he and Mézard are setting their sights on a more
ambitious goal: to build a theory of economics from the ground up.

An economy is just a large number of people who can trade with each
other. Each individual has a certain amount of money he or she can
invest or use to buy the services or goods of others. This is all
beyond argument.  Things get more contentious when you try to turn
these words into precise equations. Who trades with whom?  Which
investments pay off and which do not?

Bouchaud and Mézard start from ground zero, with only one assumption:
life is unpredictable. Buy some stocks and you might get a healthy
return or a devastating loss; returns on investments are random. The
trade network is also haphazard. Each person trades with a few others
chosen at random from the population. "Our idea," says Bouchaud, "is
to see how much we can explain on the basis of little more than pure
noise."

With these few ingredients, the model seems to contain almost nothing
at all. "In its basic points," says Mézard, "it's really trivial."
There are many ways to build these basic elements into some equations,
but fortunately the researchers had another clue.

A guiding principle of physics is the notion of invariance. Rotate a
circle about its centre, and its shape remains unchanged. This is what
makes a circle an especially simple and important shape in geometry.
Similarly, the fundamental equations of physics are invariant under
the action of certain mathematical operations, making them special
cases in the space of all possible equations. Newton's laws of
mechanics don't change if you alter the velocities of every body by an
equal amount; otherwise, the physics you saw would change depending on
how fast you were moving.

The economic equivalent of this is that a theory should produce the
same results if you change the units of currency. "This is what we try
to explain to our children," he says, "when they complain that their
pocket money will go down when we shift to euros."  Consequently,
Bouchaud and Mézard wrote down the simplest equations they could find
that were invariant with changes in currency.

Getting equations is one thing; solving them, another.  There are
millions of people in an economy, and that means millions of
equations, which is why economists have tended to shun this "bottom
up" approach.  Bouchaud and Mézard made their task easier by keeping
the ingredients of their model so simple, but they were still left
with a daunting task. Then, earlier this year, they became the
beneficiaries of a miraculous mathematical coincidence.

As "condensed matter" physicists, the pair have for two decades been
investigating the properties of solids and liquids, substances in
which the atoms or molecules are crammed together. The traditional
subjects of this field are materials such as pure metals and water,
whose particles settle into a well-defined state such as an ordered
crystal. But since the 1970s, researchers have been increasingly
intrigued by "ill-condensed" matter in which competing forces
frustrate this condensation. In this class of materials--which
includes glass, dirty alloys and polymers--the particles can end up in
a vast number of disordered but more or less equivalent
configurations.

Two competing forces

To overcome some of the mathematical difficulties in the theories of
these materials, physicists have invented a simple "toy model" called
the directed polymer.  Imagine a long wire (the polymer) lying on a
landscape that undulates up and down at random (click on thumbnail
below for diagram). The wire is tethered at one end to a post. Gravity
will tend to pull it down into the valleys, but as the landscape is
random, the wire will have to bend to do so. So two forces--gravity
and the wire's desire to stay straight--compete with one another.

As a result, the wire has to compromise: running through the valleys,
so long as that doesn't entail too much bending, and, whenever the
path becomes too tortuous, arching up over a pass to seek a straighter
route.  There is no obvious "best path" for it to follow.

Many physical systems behave in a similar way. Take a magnetic field
line, for example, as it tries to slip through a high-temperature
superconductor. Left alone, it would follow a straight path. But these
materials contain defects--analogous to the valleys and peaks--that
attract or repel the lines.  So the path they take is some compromise
between going straight through and swinging by attractive defects.

In such real, physical problems, working out the details of the
compromise is difficult. In 1988, however, physicists Bernard Derrida
and Herbert Spohn of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris solved a
version of the directed-polymer problem exactly. There is one extra
crucial element in the problem: temperature. In seeking some path
across the random landscape, for example, the wire also puts up with a
continual buffeting from air molecules, which knock it about from one
path to another. The buffeting grows more vigorous with increasing
temperature, and, as it turns out, the strength of this storm
determines how the wire manages its compromise between going straight
across and staying in the valleys.

"When the temperature is high," says Mézard, "the peaks and valleys
have little effect." The buffeting is so violent that the polymer
largely ignores the landscape, and flaps about all over the place. As
the temperature falls, however, there comes a point at which the
buffeting is no longer strong enough to drive the polymer over the
landscape's peaks. Suddenly, the peaks and valleys become far more
influential, and the polymer gets stuck in place, trapped along one
irregular path. This sudden condensation is like the freezing of
glass, or the pinning in place of a magnetic field line.

Mézard and Bouchaud have now discovered that the equations for this
directed polymer model are identical to those for their economy
(Physica A, vol 282, p 536; xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat/0002374). So to
solve their equations they need do no more than pluck out some gems
from the physics literature. And what these equations show is that
under normal conditions, their economy follows Pareto's law.

To see how the model economy and a directed polymer are related takes
a little imagination. Start with the irregular landscape, and throw a
whole bunch of polymers across it. Let them settle down, and take a
snapshot. This is now a picture of the economy over time.

Think of the people in the economy occupying positions on the y-axis
of the landscape, and progressing to the right over time (see Diagram,
p 24). A polymer plots the path of some quantity of money as it moves
from person to person. So at any point, the wealth of a particular
person is determined by the number of polymers that cross over their
y-value.

The irregular returns on investments are reflected in the ruggedness
of the landscape: deep valleys are places where there tends to be more
money, the returns in investments being high; peaks are where
investors fare badly and money is rare. The vigour of trade--how
easily money flows between people--is analogous to the
temperature. "The wealth follows a kind of random walk," says
Bouchaud.

There is, however, more than one kind of random walk.  Which kind
wealth follows depends on how "hot" the economy is. When trading is
easy, and the irregularity of returns on investment not too severe,
the economy behaves like a polymer at high temperature. Just as the
polymer flaps up and down with ease, adopting almost any configuration
without being too strongly affected by the underlying landscape, so
does vigorous trading enable wealth to flow easily from one person to
another, tending to spread money more evenly.

But because the returns on investment are proportional to the amount
invested, rich people tend to win or lose larger amounts than
poorer. Over time, even if all changes are random, wealth ends up
following Pareto's law with an exponent E between 2 and 3. How much
money an individual has need have nothing to do with ability. Chop off
the heads of the rich, and a new rich will soon take their place.

This is not to say that the distribution of wealth cannot be
influenced. The model offers what might be the first lesson of
economics to be firmly founded in mathematics: that the way to
distribute wealth more fairly is to encourage its movement. Taxation,
for example, tends to increase E. This is still a Pareto law, but with
the wealth distributed somewhat more equitably, the rich own a smaller
fraction of the overall pie. With an exponent of 3, for example, the
richest 20 per cent would own 55 per cent of the wealth. It's still
not fair, but it's better than the US today.

The model makes it clear, however, that taxes only work when they are
redistributed evenly: if the rich get a disproportionate
share--because of lucrative corporate contracts with the government,
for example--then the social effect of the tax is wiped out. And
according to economist Anthony Atkinson of Oxford University, economic
texts have long assumed that there should be some kind of "trade-off"
between equality and efficiency: that while spreading the wealth more
evenly, higher taxes will also slow economic growth.

Fairer and freer trade

Yet there may be many ways besides taxes to help wealth move about,
for instance by widening the number of people with which any one
person tends to trade. In other words, Bouchaud and Mézard's model
implies that a more equal society could come from encouraging fairer
and freer trade, exchange and competition. Happily for economists,
this idea dovetails with their experience and expectations, but the
model gives these expectations a robust mathematical foundation.

If hot means vigorous trading and low volatility in investments, cold
means restricted trading and highly irregular returns. As Bouchaud and
Mézard reduce the ease of trade and increase the degree to which
investments are random, they find a sudden change in their
distribution of wealth: in a cold economy, wealth freezes.

Just as the polymer gets trapped into one irregular valley, and so
follows a path dictated almost entirely by the random landscape, so
wealth finds itself unable to flow easily between people. In this
case, the natural diffusion of wealth provided by trading is
overwhelmed by the disparities kicked up by random returns on
investment.  In Bouchaud and Mézard's model, the economy falls out of
the Pareto phase into something much nastier. Now wealth becomes even
less fairly distributed, condensing into the pockets of a handful of
super-rich "robber barons".

Might this be the case today in some developing or troubled nations?
It has been estimated, for example, that the richest 40 people in
Mexico have nearly 30 per cent of the money. According to economist
Thomas Lux of the University of Kiel in Germany, "most economists
would anticipate that wealth concentration will be higher in economies
with limited exchange opportunities--such as Russia, for example".
Unfortunately, he adds, "these are usually the economies for which we
have poor data or no data at all." Mézard suspects that such societies
may have been more common in the past, but again the economic data are
sparse. So testing this prediction of the model won't be easy.

Having illuminated Pareto's law of wealth, Bouchaud and Mézard's
approach is pointing towards a deeper theoretical perspective on
economics. They hope to build more realistic models by moving away
from the assumptions of complete randomness, and that every economic
agent is identical. Their work offers the promise of understanding not
only how the economy behaves now, but also how things might
conceivably change.

Could political instability throw an economy out of the Pareto regime?
Or might wealth condensation be a generic risk if there is too much
central planning in an economy? And are there any other hidden
variables, changes that might tumble an economy over the precipice and
into the depths of inequality? With the global economy becoming more
and more tightly knit, these are questions that should concern the
whole planet.

another excellent topic, Natasha

I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one goes 
"out-of-body" by going on line, all that is visible (other than a typeface) 
is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website, look at a picture, and 
sometimes the beauty inside is reflected outside. But. Too many times ugly 
people have beautiful skins, and they show their "true colors" on a list 
forum or in posts...  or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may 
have Beautiful Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an 
online entity... 
this "inside out" approach is what first fascinated me about meeting people 
thru the net.

As one who is vividly enthusiastic about beauty, I think one of the things 
you might explore is pushing the envelope of *what* we accept as beauty. As 
you know, I believe advertising has much to do with what we commonly eat - 
visually as well as actual fuel nourishment. With your background and 
knowledge of aesthetics and ads, and your cool art series about body 
enhancement, what can you see being needed...

... as the new beauty alarms, repels, attracts, ...look, if people start to 
modify... leopard skins, diamond nails, fish scales, translucent eyeballs, 
extra long limbs, extreme thickness of muscles, etc. Some people won't know 
how to react, will they?

Things that NOW look freakish, because they'd be impossible naturally.
Will there be prejudice against mods? I think so.. unless....
People will accept it ... surely they need to be re-educated... will it be 
cool? Wil it be a trend? um...sure...if it's presented well, and backed by 
sponsorship and ads?
public awareness? endorsments? what....

Any anabolic substances that promote extreme thickness of muscles may/will 
be threatened to be made illegal, we have a serious anti-metahuman bias 
here..

I'm not using the curves.  The curves still say 2020 (although actually,
I haven't recalculated for Blue Gene yet).

There are no project estimates when it comes to basic research, but
2008-2010 is the project estimate I'm not making.  If you see what I
mean.

Space exploration and colonization.  This is one of the biggest, if not the
biggest, endeavor mankind has encountered in the history of civilization.  It
is, however, going to require us to rethink some of our most basic assumptions 
about how we measure value and economy, and how we deal with so-called common
goods, and "unaccounted costs" of business and living.

The basic assumptions about value and scarcity have to be reconsidered.  Things
that we take for granted here on earth (breathable air, clean water, protection
from radiation) are all commodities of a remarkable scarcity on another world.
Unless you are underwater or buried underground, you can always take a breath
(and unless you're near a chemical spill or volcanic eruption, odds are it's
life-sustaining).  In an extra-terrestrial colony situation, however, air is a
limited resource.  The same goes for water, and even food - you can't forage
the surface of Mars, so any kind of food production collapse inherently means
famine.  Thus the basis fr the economy is very different - it isn't based on
the assumption that a life, albeit an uncomfortable one, is attainable even
if you are somehow excluded from the economic system.

The idea o value will also take a radical change.  Things that are considered
economically inviable (i.e. widespread photovoltaic electricity production, 
micro-scale chemical manufacturing, commercial hydroponics) suddenly become 
more valuable given the constraints of limited "traditional" resources (no 
petrochemicals to start with) and limitations of other "non-traditional" 
resources (pure water, volume for production, constant air pressure, human
resources).  Economies of scale are less useful with a limited market and the
specialized needs te environment poses.  This will lead to a rethinking of 
economic production, one would hope, since for a time huge refineries and 
power plants are unlikely at best.

"Unaccounted costs" will be the area where business practices and economic
estimates will have to chang themost, however.  Such "unaccounted" costs of,
say, an automobile-based transportation system include air pollution, water
pollution, noise pollution, increased road maintenance, and the possibility of
increased cancer rates, plus the extra space required to store and maintain a 
vehicle.  In a closed, limited environment with negligible carrying capacity
for pollutants, a slight fouling of the air will not be carried away by the 
breeze or the next storm - there IS no next storm.  Additionally, something
that contaminates water will either have to be filtered or the water discarded,
making water a non-renewable resource in the end.  And any space that becomes
too fouled to use will be lost - at a time when space/volume is limited.

Common goods become critical because those things everyone share will have
to me actively maintained.  It won't be acceptable, for example, for leaky
gas lines in a domed setting - indeed, the enclosed structure in this case 
is a major common good that needs to be maintained.  This requires the 
vigilance and maintenance by some sort of organization - a government, perhaps,
or a "non-aligned" (non-profit?) corporation that maintains, repairs, and
upgrades these facilities.  

The worst possible situation to arise here is that there is no prior economic
system to build up from, or to revert to if mistakes have been made.  The 
economy must be capable of tuning itself and running sustained from the 
beginning, lest it crash and the entire economic infrastructure fail.  This
may be the most difficult task (economically speaking) facing a colony - until
it is constructued and begins to be populatd, it can rely upon external 
economic inputs.  Once it is established, however, it may need to quickly
establish its own economic reality or face irreconcilable economic hardship.

In the end, the old economc models will be inadequate for dealing with the 
critical first year or two of an established extraterrestrial colony's 
existence.  How these questiosn ar edealt with in the planning stages could 
set thestage for the success or failure of mankind's presence as a resident
and habitant of other worlds.

This reminds me of a story I heard about LBJ's early career.
He was running against a popular figure; a fellow who owned a hog farm.  LBJ suggested to his campaign manager that he should surreptitiously spread the rumor that his opponent was more than friendly with his barnyard charges.
"C'mon, Lyndon!", the campaign manager exclaimed.  "We can't ggo around calling your opponent a pig fucker!"
"No, no.", LBJ replied.  "Just get the son-of-a-bitch to DENY it!"

Pity the poor non-Yank here for a moment. I can work out just about
everything American from all the movies & TV that deluge us, but `root
beer' is a very wonderful and disturbing concept when seen from up here in
Oz. In our dialect, a root is an, uh, act of vigorous sexual congress,
often performed with (or impaired by) the aid of many tinnies of beer. So
naturally no gentleman could ever offer a lady such a beverage without fear
of being misunderstood; it would be entirely shocking. Nor could any manly
man possibly sink a root beer with a bunch of other guys while maintaining
a straight face.

As for those fellows coming to the door with their mighty industrial
RotaRooters, it is to faint quite away.

No no Damien. It's not "rooting with beer" we are talking about here. It
is ROOT beer. You guys in Oz are a strange lot, eh? Mind you if I lived in
a country with the most deadly spiders, snakes, jellyfish and octipi on
the planet (to say nothing of the "cane toad") I'd probably do a LOT with
beer!

Or as Tigger once said, plunging thousands of feet from the terrible heights 
is just like falling out of bed.  "Except for the 'splat' at the end, 
they're practically similar."

I've always thought the idea of "rooting for your team" was pretty
interesting. I don't know why we don't have root beer; it would sell in
bulk.

There's a whole field of opportunity with mixed up slang, of course. For
instance, smokers might know that a "fag" is a cigarette in Oz. However,
this doesn't mean you should ask someone here if you can "bum a fag"; it
means something different to what you think it means.

LEF Email List1 - http://www.lef.org

Pharmaceutical attacks against dietary supplements are heating up once
again, and the US General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a 47 page
report on July 11, 2000. It falsely concludes that federal law and
agencies provide limited assurance of the safety of functional foods and
dietary supplements, and strongly encourages unnecessary regulation to
"reign in" our industry.

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00156.pdf This GAO Report has been heavily
influenced by a long time critic of the supplement industry: Center for
Science in the Public Interest, who are staunch supporters of the FDA and
pharmaceutical interests. International Advocates for Health Freedom
(IAHF) warns LEF members that GAO reports of this type always lead to
legislative attacks against the industry, and that if the Democrats should
regain just 6 seats in the House, it would give them a majority in
Congress.

This would put arch enemies of the supplement industry Congressmen John
Dingle of Michigan, and Henry Waxman of California back in control of the
House Commerce Committee and of the Health and Environment Subcommittee,
and both have vowed to repeal DSHEA- legislation that has protected our
access to supplements since 1994. 

Neither the German or American proposals to regulate vitamins currently on
the table before the UN's Codex Alimentarius Committee can be accepted by
consumers, as both severely threaten our access.

In order to learn how you can help fight CODEX, be sure to read John
Hammell's latest Codex article about his recent trip to the Codex meeting
in Germany at: http://iahf.com/codex/20000726.html  IAHF

Pity the poor non-Yank here for a moment. I can work out just about
everything American from all the movies & TV that deluge us, but `root
beer' is a very wonderful and disturbing concept when seen from up here in
Oz. In our dialect, a root is an, uh, act of vigorous sexual congress,
often performed with (or impaired by) the aid of many tinnies of beer. So
naturally no gentleman could ever offer a lady such a beverage without fear
of being misunderstood; it would be entirely shocking. Nor could any manly
man possibly sink a root beer with a bunch of other guys while maintaining
a straight face.

As for those fellows coming to the door with their mighty industrial
RotaRooters, it is to faint quite away.

We were always warned that it was de trop to be seen in school uniform with
a fag in one's mouth.

Which isn't as strange, perhaps, as hearing some red-faced bigot shouting
(and I have witnessed this, I swear to dog) that he has nothing against
hoe-moe-sexuals as such, he just doesn't want them shoving it down his throat!

The concept of physical beauty is a weird one. I'd be surprised if it has
much to do with our physical bodies in the future.

I find myself spending ever more time in the weird disembodiment of online
life. I like it, I think, but it does conflict with the physical realm
somewhat; each competes for limited attention.

I remember reading some predictions by Faith Popcorn (geez, where did she
get that name?), that the near future would be marked by people retreating
into the home-fortress, venturing out less and less often, having everything
delivered to them via the wonderful internet. Although I was dubious at the
time, I can see it more now. Recently I've had a few friends raving to me
about a new Home Shopping service introduced by one of our biggest
supermarket chains; you do your grocery shopping online, and it turns up at
the front door. As someone who relies on walks to the local shops for
exercise (and generation of vitamin D), it doesn't appeal. But then again, I
spend a lot more time at home than most people (teleworking - actually most
of my time is on the 'net, of course, which is not much like being home at
all).

I see two convergent trends. The first is that noted above; the retreat from
interaction, into the home. The second is stronger global service markets,
implying larger distances between supplier & consumer, and so more reliance
on advanced information & communication technology, and less reliance on
travel. That's in its early days still, but is increasing rapidly. As
bandwidth increases and latency falls, as the tools improve and we become
more comfortable with them, how does physical travel (slow, disruptive,
expensive) compete with electronic communications (fast, easy, cheap)?

Back onto the topic of beauty... Maybe I hang out with too many geeks, but I
notice more concern with appearance of people's cars than with their own
appearance (my car is a broken down '81 ford laser, and I think it still
might have the upper hand). The power of the car in the modern psyche (what
does psyche mean again? ergh, well, you know) is immense. I'd imagine that
TH types tend to underestimate the strength of the car as a symbol of
identity in competition with the body itself. It seems to be about trying to
get security & freedom in one package, a little travelling embassy of the
home fortress.

I'm  convinced that "telepresence robots" will be a future move. One path is
as a natural evolution of the car. People love their cars, but they don't
necessarily like being in them. Much better if you could stay at home, and
drive your car from the safety of your loungeroom over your web tv (maybe
the next version of the playstation will support this).

Of course, when it arrives, your car would have to be able to do the things
that you would do, if you had been in it. Not so hard to make it talk, and
listen (speakers and microphones, big deal). It'd have to get a lot smaller,
but that's ok, because there's no passengers in it any more. So it would be
able to go into buildings, talk to people (probably other "cars"). It'd need
to be able to manipulate things, and navigate weird terrain, so it might
have robot arms and legs.

You can see where I'm heading. I think you might find that there is a
significant movement, before body mods are possible, towards external
bodies. You stay at home, and send your personal avatar out into the world.
It interacts with other avatars and those few souls still out there in
person. These things would be quite amazing visually, I think; people would
take great pride in them. Although I wonder if they'd all be same-same, much
like modern cars.

You can see it would meet all kinds of needs; fear of the outside world, a
powerful feeling of not being in danger of physical violence, yet an ability
to interact with the world using a suped-up body which far excedes the
capabilities of the flesh form. Security and freedom, together at last. Or
that's how I'd sell it, anyway.

It's just an intermediate step, on the road between here and an utterly
virtual existence (where b2b means brain 2 brain). But all the steps are
intermediary in reality; life is about the journey, given the uninspiring
destination.

I know it seems like a weird vision of the future. Next time you see a
couple of younguns sitting near each other, communicating by sending text
messages to each other on their mobiles, think about this again.

another excellent topic, Natasha

I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one goes
"out-of-body" by going on line, all that is visible (other than a typeface)
is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website, look at a picture, and
sometimes the beauty inside is reflected outside. But. Too many times ugly
people have beautiful skins, and they show their "true colors" on a list
forum or in posts...  or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may
have Beautiful Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an
online entity...
this "inside out" approach is what first fascinated me about meeting people
thru the net.

As one who is vividly enthusiastic about beauty, I think one of the things
you might explore is pushing the envelope of *what* we accept as beauty. As
you know, I believe advertising has much to do with what we commonly eat -
visually as well as actual fuel nourishment. With your background and
knowledge of aesthetics and ads, and your cool art series about body
enhancement, what can you see being needed...

... as the new beauty alarms, repels, attracts, ...look, if people start to
modify... leopard skins, diamond nails, fish scales, translucent eyeballs,
extra long limbs, extreme thickness of muscles, etc. Some people won't know
how to react, will they?

Things that NOW look freakish, because they'd be impossible naturally.
Will there be prejudice against mods? I think so.. unless....
People will accept it ... surely they need to be re-educated... will it be
cool? Wil it be a trend? um...sure...if it's presented well, and backed by
sponsorship and ads?
public awareness? endorsments? what....

I found an article on the net about that breakthrough in molecular computing

This is a story on one of UCLA's competitors in the race to develop the
first molecular computer. They're pretty optimistic too.

"Breakthrough" is a rather strong word. We should reserve it for truly
special occasions. Demonstrating switching behaviour in an isolated
molecule alone is not new nor particularly useful. The hardly tackled
problem of building macroscopic blocks of designed circuitry by
autoassembly has been and still remains the bottleneck for real-world
circuits. Whether Langmuir-Blodgett 2d array memories or molecular
crystal 3d memories or even molecular circuit cellular automata
machines, the problem of hierarchical complementary-shape
self-assembly has not yet received as much attention as it
should. Without this a mole of the fanciest molecular switch will
remain a featureless coloured goo in a flask, not a machine.

Oh, we should have molecular memories (probably 2d, as single-layer
2d-crystal assemblies of protein-enveloped molecular bits in
polymerized Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers on silicon substrate) 10-15
years from now. But these are not yet computers, only parts of
computers. Singularity will have to wait little a bit longer, I'm
afraid.

After spending countless hours; years?  on chat networks, I have seen a 
predictable counter reaction to immersion, in that people after a time begin 
to crave RL enriched experience.



The concept of physical beauty is a weird one. I'd be surprised if it has
much to do with our physical bodies in the future.

I find myself spending ever more time in the weird disembodiment of online
life. I like it, I think, but it does conflict with the physical realm
somewhat; each competes for limited attention.

I remember reading some predictions by Faith Popcorn (geez, where did she
get that name?), that the near future would be marked by people retreating
into the home-fortress, venturing out less and less often, having everything
delivered to them via the wonderful internet. Although I was dubious at the
time, I can see it more now. Recently I've had a few friends raving to me
about a new Home Shopping service introduced by one of our biggest
supermarket chains; you do your grocery shopping online, and it turns up at
the front door. As someone who relies on walks to the local shops for
exercise (and generation of vitamin D), it doesn't appeal. But then again, I
spend a lot more time at home than most people (teleworking - actually most
of my time is on the 'net, of course, which is not much like being home at
all).

I see two convergent trends. The first is that noted above; the retreat from
interaction, into the home. The second is stronger global service markets,
implying larger distances between supplier & consumer, and so more reliance
on advanced information & communication technology, and less reliance on
travel. That's in its early days still, but is increasing rapidly. As
bandwidth increases and latency falls, as the tools improve and we become
more comfortable with them, how does physical travel (slow, disruptive,
expensive) compete with electronic communications (fast, easy, cheap)?

Back onto the topic of beauty... Maybe I hang out with too many geeks, but I
notice more concern with appearance of people's cars than with their own
appearance (my car is a broken down '81 ford laser, and I think it still
might have the upper hand). The power of the car in the modern psyche (what
does psyche mean again? ergh, well, you know) is immense. I'd imagine that
TH types tend to underestimate the strength of the car as a symbol of
identity in competition with the body itself. It seems to be about trying to
get security & freedom in one package, a little travelling embassy of the
home fortress.

I'm  convinced that "telepresence robots" will be a future move. One path is
as a natural evolution of the car. People love their cars, but they don't
necessarily like being in them. Much better if you could stay at home, and
drive your car from the safety of your loungeroom over your web tv (maybe
the next version of the playstation will support this).

Of course, when it arrives, your car would have to be able to do the things
that you would do, if you had been in it. Not so hard to make it talk, and
listen (speakers and microphones, big deal). It'd have to get a lot smaller,
but that's ok, because there's no passengers in it any more. So it would be
able to go into buildings, talk to people (probably other "cars"). It'd need
to be able to manipulate things, and navigate weird terrain, so it might
have robot arms and legs.

You can see where I'm heading. I think you might find that there is a
significant movement, before body mods are possible, towards external
bodies. You stay at home, and send your personal avatar out into the world.
It interacts with other avatars and those few souls still out there in
person. These things would be quite amazing visually, I think; people would
take great pride in them. Although I wonder if they'd all be same-same, much
like modern cars.

You can see it would meet all kinds of needs; fear of the outside world, a
powerful feeling of not being in danger of physical violence, yet an ability
to interact with the world using a suped-up body which far excedes the
capabilities of the flesh form. Security and freedom, together at last. Or
that's how I'd sell it, anyway.

It's just an intermediate step, on the road between here and an utterly
virtual existence (where b2b means brain 2 brain). But all the steps are
intermediary in reality; life is about the journey, given the uninspiring
destination.

I know it seems like a weird vision of the future. Next time you see a
couple of younguns sitting near each other, communicating by sending text
messages to each other on their mobiles, think about this again.

another excellent topic, Natasha

I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one goes
"out-of-body" by going on line, all that is visible (other than a typeface)
is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website, look at a picture, and
sometimes the beauty inside is reflected outside. But. Too many times ugly
people have beautiful skins, and they show their "true colors" on a list
forum or in posts...  or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may
have Beautiful Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an
online entity...
this "inside out" approach is what first fascinated me about meeting people
thru the net.

As one who is vividly enthusiastic about beauty, I think one of the things
you might explore is pushing the envelope of *what* we accept as beauty. As
you know, I believe advertising has much to do with what we commonly eat -
visually as well as actual fuel nourishment. With your background and
knowledge of aesthetics and ads, and your cool art series about body
enhancement, what can you see being needed...

... as the new beauty alarms, repels, attracts, ...look, if people start to
modify... leopard skins, diamond nails, fish scales, translucent eyeballs,
extra long limbs, extreme thickness of muscles, etc. Some people won't know
how to react, will they?

Things that NOW look freakish, because they'd be impossible naturally.
Will there be prejudice against mods? I think so.. unless....
People will accept it ... surely they need to be re-educated... will it be
cool? Wil it be a trend? um...sure...if it's presented well, and backed by
sponsorship and ads?
public awareness? endorsments? what....

Thanks, John, for posting this pointer.  This is truly breakthrough work.  What comes across clearly is the surprise of the researchers
about how fast the new developments are coming.  Here is a case in which the rate of change of the rate of change (or change acceleration)
is palpable.

On last Wednesdays Oprah I heard Dr. Phil Mcgraw state an extropian notion in 
answer to a question about May/December romance. He said if you live another 
ten years, your life expectancy will reach 125 years. Another ten, 250 years.

Is that naturally occurring human time, Doctor, or subject cosmic overmind 
time?

Extropians,

	There's a great pointer on www.nanodot.org to info about a
grant that his being given to Brown University to fund a project using
nano devices to study, probe, and communicate with the brain on the
neuron scale.

	The most fascinating thing to me is this terse comment:

> The group's proposal is to create a tiny device that would emit
> light to stimulate brain cells and record light from brain cells,
> analogous to a camera.

	Wooow, do brain neurons produce light?  And are they sensative
to real light?  I have never heard anything like this before.  I've
got to do a literature and web search for more information on this.
If anyone has any pointers to more information on this topic please
forward them to me!

	This is fantastic!!!  Ability to communicate with neurons at
this scale is always what I've figured would be required before we can
ever understand what is going on in there.  This MRI stuff, as
unbelievable as it is, is just a big joke!  Can you imagine trying to
figure out what a computer does and how it works without a logic probe
but only using something external like an MRI?

Yes, I agree with you that telepresence is one future direction,
and one will continue to evolve.  I appreciated your emphasis
on the automobile as an extension of the human body, but I don't
understand why you would think that this concept is foreign to
anyone, especially me.  My entire concept for Primo 3M+ is based
on the future body as a vehicle.  The blueprint stats compare
this future body to the current body in a layout design which
is a spin on a car ad.

You are quite right. There are contradictory predictions that people will
start walking a lot more, interacting with local people, getting "back to
nature" (whatever that means).

I think these two things merge well. I see people using advanced comms to
stop having to interact directly with people they don't want to, and to stop
losing time to pointless stuff (like walking around a supermarket, or
commuting to work; like not having to put up with office managers).

But we still need human contact, we just become freer to choose who that
contact is with. For instance, I telework to the US, so no commuting. But I
walk to the local shops (20 minute round trip) at the drop of a hat; for
milk or a loaf of bread. I often do my work in the local cafes - it's nice
because there are people around, like at work, but they don't ask me if I
can fix up their excel spreadsheet; and there's good music instead of some
hideous baby-boomers golden oldies classic crap radio station, and when my
latte is empty it gets replaced. Much of my professional help, like lawyers
and accountants, comes from people in walking distance. I know a lot of
local people in businesses in the main street; I very rarely go into the
heart of Melbourne. I don't run a car anymore.

I'm not saying I'm indicative of the norm; for instance, I don't run a car
anymore. But I think the way I'm making choices will become more popular;
it's the time of "lifestyle". People choosing "lifestyle" (another one of
those weird ill defined words) over corporate slavery. And this will mean
optimizing out stuff that is dreary and avoidable (like commuting), and
replacing it with "lifestyle" stuff.

I'm still waiting for them crazy robots, however. I'm not sure why robotics
people are so hung up on making human-equivalent brains; there's plenty
around now, implemented in wetware. Just give us good, high bandwidth,
immersive remote controls. I'm there!

For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from a US
robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US clients
and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole in
Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.

http://www.senate.gov/~commerce/hearings/1020mcc.pdf<


This is an excellent example of how enhancing the body could
become a legal battle when the world-wide interests of society
along with enormous amounts of money are invested in the business
of the human body and its physical capabilities under the umbrella
of sports. 

The issue of where or not an athlete's enhancing her or his body
while competing is a very involved issue.  What is enhancing?
 If a person performs TM (meditation for lowering he heart rate)
prior to a competition is that person enhancing his/her body?
 What about an athlete who wears contacts, or puts extra padding
in his sneakers?  Such are very mundane enhancements, but enhancements
are relative.  What about the athlete who takes HRT or the diabetic
who needs medication, the long distance jumper who wears knee
pads, or the swimmer who wears a suit that glides through the
water without friction.

The Olympic council will work around enhancing supplements and
augmentations as the years unfold.  I envision a time when the
Universal Olympics will be held off-planet and the athletes,
human and transhuman, will be poster entities for body replacement
parts, upgrades and advanced prosthetics.

But, getting back to this article, there is a part of me that
understands why this is such a strong issue.  Yesterday at Gold's
Gym I saw several human bodies that looked very steroid induced.
 While it wasn't particularly attractive to me, the few I saw
thought they looked pretty darn good.  Should steriod bodies
compete with non-steriod bodies?  Common sense would deem it
an imbalance, and for good reason.  It would be more balanced
if they competed with others who were taking the same enhancing
substances and make this a separate event.

The future Olympics will be different and more varied. There
is no way that in the year 2030 that the Olympics will be solely
and exclusively for biological humans.

Just in case anyone was wondering if my recent posts on The Science
of Beauty are duplicative, they aren't :-)  I just read each
person's thoughts and wanted to reply to each one.  

Thanks,
Natasha

Thank you for your thoughts on this subject.

In the talk I gave at the recent Alcor Technology Conference,
I repeated a phrase several times which I recently put in a large
digital image which now pillars over my studio.  "alphabetical
letters arranged into words written in strings of algorythmic
codes."  This phrase is taken out of the following 2-paragraph
taken from my talk:


"Many of my current friends, I’ve never met. Most of my communications
are alphabetical letters arranged into words written in strings
of algorythmic codes. Most of the time I don’t know what my friends
look like, or what they are feeling. Feelings are sometimes difficult
to express in written words for fear we may come off weak or
soft, vulnerable or naive.

"When I think of our culture, I see it as a body of electronically
connected data filtering messages into its appendages. Out into
the capillaries of culture, our technology has become far more
exacting and more robust than our biological bodies. Our biological
bodies are far too inadequate to keep up with our ideas and the
new landscapes we venture. From the telegraph to telecommunications,
from the Net into Space, it is no longer just the written symbol—the
word—being transported, we are the new transportees."

It is interesting that this story has been reprinted again; I reported it
on TransDot on the 15th, courtesy of the Houston Chronicle.  Despite the
apparent redundancy in major media, the article is indeed very positive,
illuminating Molecular Electronics as being a veritable leading edge
company.  Hey, the more coverage, the better.

I was thinking of fellow members of the geeksquad; we think of travelling to
Mars (or dissassembling it for spares), and forget that other people spend
the same time thinking about getting a Suburban.

I like what you did with the Primo 3M+. I guess I'm wondering how large the
trend will be toward body mods, when an external body (thought about like a
car) might be easier, possible sooner, and more suited to many peoples'
paradigms; especially when people are getting "back to nature" (I think that
might mean eating each other, but I suspect that's not the common
interpretation).

Personally, I don't really care about the body mods in the near future. As
long as I can keep ticking along, decrepitude and all, I'm happy enough. I'm
brute-force time travelling into the future.

One path is as a natural evolution of the car. People love their
cars, but they don't necessarily like being in them. Much better
if you could stay at home, and drive your car from the safety
of your loungeroom over your web tv (maybe the next version of
the playstation will support this).<

Yes, I agree with you that telepresence is one future direction,
and one will continue to evolve.  I appreciated your emphasis
on the automobile as an extension of the human body, but I don't
understand why you would think that this concept is foreign to
anyone, especially me.  My entire concept for Primo 3M+ is based
on the future body as a vehicle.  The blueprint stats compare
this future body to the current body in a layout design which
is a spin on a car ad.

I would imagine that the Para-Olympics would be a good place to look at
trends in this direction. Those guys deal with issues of human-mods now.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE AUGUST 25 2000

IN THIS ISSUE AUGUST 25 2000:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Estrogen
replacement fails to protect heart patients; PROTOCOLS:  Female Hormone
Modulation Therapy, Male Hormone Modulation Therapy;  LIFE EXTENSION
MAGAZINE, August 2000:  Hormone replacement and heightened cancer risk;
PRODUCT OF THE MONTH:  ProFem; BLOOD TEST SPECIAL!

Estrogen replacement fails to protect heart patients

The lead article in this week's (August 24, 2000) New England Journal of
Medicine reiterates what we've been hearing for months now: hormone
replacement therapy in women may not protect against the progression of
cardiovascular disease.

Studies reported in the news recently have warned that hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) can lead to a woman's increased chances of breast cancer.
Physicians have known that HRT could increase the risk of breast cancer,
but have stressed its supposed heart protective benefit as justifying that
risk. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in this country,
followed by cancer, with breast cancer being among the most common types
of cancer experienced by women.

In an attempt to confirm findings of a previous study, researchers
conducting the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial assigned 309
women with coronary disease either 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily,
estrogen plus 2.5 mg of synthetic progesterone, or a placebo. The women
were followed for a mean 3.2 years. Although the women receiving the
hormones experienced lower LDL and higher HDL levels which have been
correlated with a lower incidence of heart disease, coronary angiograms
taken before and after treatment did not show a significant difference in
the progression of atherosclerosis between the groups, nor was there a
significant difference in the amount of cardiovascular events experienced.

The abstract concluded with the statement, "These results suggest that
such women should not use estrogen replacement with an expectation of
cardiovascular benefit." The authors added that it is unknown whether
estrogen replacement could effect the development of primary coronary
artery disease. They speculate that estrogen's benefit in  preventing
atherosclerosis could be offset by its promotion of inflammation, and
refer to several studies that show an elevation in C-reactive protein in
women using both estrogen alone or combined with progestins, which is
associated with increased inflammation and an elevated risk of
cardiovascular events.


PROTOCOL
Female Hormone Modulation Therapy

Concern about the life-threatening side effects of synthetic hormone drugs
has caused many women to be deprived of the benefits of safe natural
hormone replacement therapy.

Proper hormone modulation can prevent degenerative disease and improve
functioning in both the physical and emotional spheres of life, both at
menopause and throughout life. For example, many sexual "dysfunctions,"
including lack of desire, can be mitigated when hormone levels are
naturally restored to a youthful profile.

Starting around age 45 to 50, women face a perplexing dilemma regarding
estrogen, one of the primary sex hormones. The amount of estrogen
naturally produced by their bodies dwindles. This estrogen deficiency
causes a wide variety of menopausal miseries, including hot flashes,
depression, vaginal dryness, anxiety, and forgetfulness.

The following nutrients and drugs are suggested to restore hormone balance
in aging women or women with symtoms of an imbalance:
1. Natural progesterone cream (ProFem): Apply topically to the skin
(follow directions as outlined in this protocol).
2. Natural Estrogen: Take one capsule, 2 times a day.
3. DHEA: Take one 15 mg capsule, 1 to 2 times a day.
4. Life Extension Mix (multivitamin supplement): Take 3 tablets, 3 times a
day.
5. Melatonin: Take 2 to 3 mg only at bedtime.
6. Consider supplementation with fish, flax, or Perilla oil to restore
fatty acid balance.
7. Consider estriol or TriEst if menopausal symptoms are not alleviated by
nonprescription therapies. Blood or saliva testing may also indicate the
need for additional estrogen or progesterone.
Blood or saliva testing after 45 days is mandatory to verify you are
taking the proper dosages.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2930/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

PROTOCOL
Male Hormone Modulation Therapy

As men age past year 40, hormonal changes occur that perceptibly inhibit
physical, sexual, and cognitive function. The outward appearance of a
typical middle aged male shows increased abdominal fat and shrinkage of
muscle mass, a hallmark effect of hormone imbalance. A loss of feeling of
well being, sometimes manifesting as depression, is a common psychological
complication of hormone imbalance.

A remarkable amount of data has been compiled indicating that many of the
diseases that middle aged men begin experiencing, including depression,
abdominal weight gain, and prostate and heart disease, are directly
related to hormone imbalances that are correctable with currently
available drug and nutrient therapies. To the patient's detriment,
conventional doctors are increasingly prescribing drugs to treat
depression, elevated cholesterol, angina, and a host of other diseases
that may be caused by an underlying hormone imbalance.

If doctors checked their male patients' blood levels of estrogen,
testosterone, thyroid, and DHEA (instead of prescribing drugs to treat
symptoms), they might be surprised to learn that many problems could be
eliminated by adjusting hormone levels to fit the profile of a healthy
21-year-old.

When embarking on a hormone modulation program, medical testing is
critical. First, a baseline blood PSA must be taken to rule out existing
prostate cancer. Then free testosterone and estradiol tests are needed to
make sure that too much testosterone is not being converted into estradiol
(estrogen). If estrogen levels are too high, the use of aromatase
inhibitors can keep testosterone from converting (aromatizing) into
estrogen in the body. Follow-up testing for estrogen, testosterone, and
PSA are needed to rule out occult prostate cancer and to fine tune your
program. It's possible that testosterone patches and creams can increase
testosterone levels too much. In that case, blood or saliva testing could
save you money by allowing you to use less of the testosterone drug.

LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE, August 2000
Hormone replacement and heightened cancer risk

A NEW PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ABOUT the adverse effects of hormone replacement
therapy has emerged from a recent mainstream scientific study. Use of the
synthetic estrogen/progestin drug combination can more than double the
risk of a certain type of breast cancer in menopausal women, according to
a study completed recently at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
in Seattle, Washington.

This is the latest in a series of studies to connect estrogen and
progestin to a heightened risk of cancer. As one bit of damning evidence
after another has emerged, even mainstream, establishment researchers have
begun to question the advisability of this astonishingly widespread
treatment.

The new findings, reported in the journal Cancer (88:2570-2577, 2000),
pertain to a relatively rare form of breast cancer. But they indicated
that, in those cases, the magnitude of hazard is substantial.
Investigators focused on what is known as lobular breast cancer. This
malignancy occurs in the milk-producing lobules of the breasts and
accounts for 10% to 15% of all cases.

"Our finding is only preliminary, but it is significant on several
counts," lead researcher Christopher Li, M.D. told LIFE EXTENSION. "First,
it establishes a danger of considerable significance."
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2932/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

PRODUCT OF THE MONTH
ProFem

Pro Fem contains USP natural progesterone from soy. Pro Fem is used by
women to prevent osteoporosis, premenstrual syndrome, some cancers and
some of the side effects of estrogen replacement therapy. Massage into
soft tissue areas such as chest, breast, underarms, wrist, abdomen or
inner thighs and apply to a different area every day to avoid saturating
the fat cells.
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2933/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html

BLOOD TEST SPECIAL

Life Extension Foundation, in collaboration with American Metabolic
Laboratories, is offering the Longevity Profile  for the special price of
$750.00. This is a saving of $35.00 off the regular Life Extension member
price and $504.00 off a commercial laboratory's patients' price. In
addition, to promote measures of disease prevention, when a member
requests the Longevity Profile,  our staff physician will order a PSA
prostate cancer test for men, or a CA-15-3 breast cancer test for women at
no additional charge.

The Longevity Profile is the most comprehensive series of blood tests that
every individual is strongly recommended to have performed annually. It is
composed of:

Chemistry Profile and Complete Blood Count (40+  blood tests for   general
health)

Cancer Profile for possible early detection of cancer and/or followup of
therapy,including DHEA-S and TSH for thyroid function

PTH for detection of bone loss due to calcium deficiency, etc.

IGF-1 (Somatomedin) the youth hormone

Sex Hormones: Estradiol, Progesterone, Free-Testosterone,

Heart Disease Prevention markers: Homocysteine and hs-CRP

Stress Hormone tests: Cortisol a.m. and p.m.

This blood testing panel can reveal a number of developing diseases. If
abnormalities are found at an early stage, reversal can often be
accomplished.

The SPECIAL is effective through November 13, 2000

I like this idea.  It may grow out of the teleconferencing industry.  I suspect
we will go a long way with just projecting your image, but when it comes to
actually manipulating objects, you need some hands.  You would expect to see
this start in the area of very specialized activity.  For example, it would nice
for local police to maintain a teleoperated bomb disposal robot, so that when
the need comes up, they dial up a contract expert somewhere and go do the job.
The same would be true for teams of rescue workers, and cleanup for hazardous
spills.

About 20 years ago, I spent some time thinking about this for teams of
teleoperated robots that would work in earth orbit.  They would be doing things
like putting together space station sections, fixing communication satellites
and running experiment labs.  The operators on earth would have a staff that
"plugged in" during shifts giving 24-7 coverage for the team.  The economics did
not work out for this as a business then, but robots are getting cheaper, and
space construction more desirable.

I am, however, now active on the other end of the size scale.  This is to make
teleoperated robots in the micro world.  When I get this together, teams of
workers will be able to get into their VR stations and be transported to a
construction site that is actually deep inside a scanning electron microscope.

It's easy to tell whether two posts are duplicates; just see whether
they were sent at different times.

These seem like large technical challenges, but relatively minor changes in
our economic models and assumptions.   Externalities and public goods are
familiar issues, though the details may change.

I worked on systems which allow barter among scientific experiments on
spacecraft, and so I know that there do tend to be more externalities among
nearby systems, at least on the small scale.  These include vibration,
pressure failures, and radiation shielding.  But the costs of monitoring
such externalities should be very low, and we are already used to having
lots of substantial externalities among humans on small space scales.

Having a viable space colony economy is very challenging, mainly because
that economy has to be very self-sufficient in all physical goods.  I think
this is why we won't see such colonies for a long time to come.  (I say a
bit more on this at http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html )

 This is to make teleoperated robots in the micro world.  When
I get this together, teams of workers will be able to get into
their VR stations and be transported to a
construction site that is actually deep inside a scanning electron
microscope.<

Visionary idea.  I would imagine that the architecture for the
teams of workers would be quite fascinating, and even stunning
to look at.  

I haven't read this book _Cellular Robotics and Micro Robotic
Systems_ by T Fukuda & T Ueyama (Nagoya Univ.), but references
I did read references about it and it covers ideas on cellular
robotics and micro robotic systems with pointers to concepts
stemming from the organic architecture of the physical body.
 An aspect of this I like a lot is focus on swarm intelligence
and emphasis on the technology of micro robotics.

Regarding telepresence, I enjoyed reading the synopsis below
by an unknown author:

"The term telepresence is often encountered in the literature
and it deserves special attention. Three definitions of the term
telepresence are in common use: the simple, the cybernetic, and
the experiential. In the simple definition, telepresence refers
to the ability to operate in a remote or computer-mediated world
generally. In the cybernetic definition, telepresence is an index
of the quality of the human-machine interface. In the experiential
definition, telepresence means a mental state in which a user
feels physically present within the remote world.

The critical difference between cybernetic and experiential telepresence
is that the cybernetic definition refers to efficiency while
the experiential definition refers to something experienced by
the human user. Cybernetic telepresence is the projection of
human capability into a remote world and experiential telepresence
is the projection of human consciousness into a computer-mediated
world.

Although the importance of experiential telepresence is widely
accepted, some authors question the value of the concept because
of the paucity of data demonstrating the existence of the phenomenon
or its relationship to task performance. Experiential telepresence
may also be criticized from the perspective of scientific parsimony:
although it postulates an additional construct lacking in the
cybernetic definition (the illusion of presence), it does not
seem to provide a more powerful explanation of observations of
teleoperator performance."  (unknown author)

Corey, while you are doing this rethinking be sure to keep in mind that the
technology available at this future time will often make modifying people to fit

What surprises me more is that life expectancy went up so high in the first
half of the 20th century -- continuing a trend from the 19th -- in the West,
but then seemed to level off in the upper 70s.  Why didn't the trend
continue, especially since the estimate for maximum human lifespan is about
125 years?

Any ideas?  explanations?  corrections?  speculations?  rants?

	while i too have undergone the process of focusing away from the
physical body in my personal experience, i can not say the same for
society as a whole. turning on the tv or taking a walk outside, it seems
to me that despite lip-service to the contrary, the public places more
significance on physical beauty than ever before. the societies of the
first world, freed by technology from the necessities of subsistence but
not quite automorphic gods, seem to be preoccupied by evolved standards of
physical beauty in this technological limbo.

	if i may assume for a minute that the standards of physical
beauty, like preference for suger and fat, is mostly an evolved
adaptation; then it follows that this kind of beauty (to distinguish it
from pure artistic beauty, if such exists) can be reduced to a measuring
heuristic for utility. thus, if our destiny is toward increasing
rationality, we might increasingly find what is useful (powerful,
beneficial) to be beautiful.

	on the other hand, in the absence of radical modification
technology (ie, hardware), i suspect that humanity will remain
predominantly adaptation executers and the majority of people will
continue the trend toward more preoccupation with evolved physical beauty
instead of less.

Age-specific mortality rates have fallen at a steady exponential rate for
the entire last century.  The classic source on this is

     Modeling and Forecasting U. S. Mortality, by Ronald D. Lee,
     Lawrence R. Carter, J. American Statistical Association,
     87(419):659-671, Sep., 1992.

There was also a recent Nature article showing that this model applies
also to a half dozen other countries.

Given the initial age distribution, this steady exponential decline in
age-specific rates produced a rapid decline in life expectancy in the
early part of this century, and a slower decline in the later part.  But
the fundamental trend has remained amazingly steady.

Hi folks.

Well, I need some help/advice.  It's a copyright issue... (ah, how the worm
has turned... :)

Some of you have seen my portfolio website-- and it contains work that I
have produced while an employee of another company.

It is not my intention to break the law-- and this prior company is now
demanding that I take down the images and video I produced while in their
employ.

Do I have legal recourse here folks?  It will be tremendously damaging to me
to be unable to show my previous work.

Educated comments appreciated.

Spike, I'd like to think that this is automatically true, but I don't think 
it is.  Small rural communities were very transparent in the past, and they 
weren't necessarily characterized by high levels of tolerance.  Check out

What part will the internet, and whatever it becomes, have in shortening the
time?  Highly technical information is instantly available to peers, who can
critique it, rework it, and respond to it.  Brainstorming has never been
easier.

I'm afraid they are talking about a normal camera, albeit very small.  It
generates light and takes pictures of the reflected light.  It is not
communicating with the neurons with light.

	Wooow, do brain neurons produce light?  And are they sensative
to real light?  I have never heard anything like this before.

I assume your former employer does not have a copyright over the material...
That leads me to ask: Did you sign any agreements with your former employer
stating that this material belonged to it?  If not, there still could be a
legal showdown over it, but it's less likely.  (Amy I right about this

I stand corrected.  It still seems to me rather surprising that life
expectancy has risen more.  (Of course, I'm probably biased here.  I want my
increased life expectancy now!:)

Let's try listing these mental abilities for comparing profiles:

memory of all kinds 
spatial/mapping/visualization abilities
logic of all kinds
verbal abilities
other?

On which would humanoids with state-of-the-art technology (no budgetary
limitations) surpass humans and vice-versa?

I'd guess that humanoids could eventually surpass humans in all these categories
except for "other."

Humans would still excel in knowing which questions to ask.

Perhaps not, because the article also includes the following:
"We want to have the man-made and the nature-made structures communicate,"
Nurmikko said.

The Brown proposal was entitled "Coupling of Brain with Microstructured
Electronic/Optoelectronic Arrays: Interactive Computation at the Bio/Info/Micro
Interface."

Note also that the grant comes from the Defense Department.
(Don't expect detailed updates if the scientists discover anything truly
useful... national security concerns will prevail.)

Several years ago, Francis Crick suggested the brain composes images while
visualizing objects, and that it does so at the rate of forty cycles per
second -- faster than the frames change in 35 MM motion pictures.

I've a couple ideas: cigarettes, warfare, highway accidents, recreational 
drugs, poor diet and lack of exercize.  For the first million years or so we 
died young because we didn't know better.  For the last 100 years or so we 
die young because we know better, but don't care.

As we go into this Olympic season we are again reminded of the
traditional nature of sports.  All the games have had the optimal
strategies long since worked out, the athletes have honed all the
same skills to within a hairs breadth of perfection, all the competitors

in each event look alike, all doing the same tricks, etc.

Booooorrrrringggggg.

What we need now are new sports, where the optimal strategy
is still debatable.  Consider the Survivor game, which you have
surely  heard about.  I didnt see any but the last half hour of the
last show, but I understand there were three remaining players
who participated in a challenge, the winner given the opportunity
to vote off one of the others.  The last three included an unpopular
man, a moderately popular woman and a very popular man.

There is a strange loop here, for the unpopular man must have
realized that the only possible way he could win the prize is
to lose the challenge!  Reasoning:  if he won the challenge, then
he would face a vote by the last 7 contestants between himself
and either the moderately popular woman or the highly popular
man.  So, he lost the challenge, which was won by the woman,
who acted in her own best interest in voting off the popular man
(to whom she would have lost in the final election) but in so doing,
she lost popularity with the jury of seven and so lost the final
election to the unpopular man!

Now thats a cool strange-loop.

In the spirit of survivor, I propose a new sport, the optimal
strategy of which is unclear.  The game is to see who can
walk (or run) the greatest distance, assuming that the competitor
must carry *all* necessary supplies, food, water, whatever else
might be needed.

To make the competition end in a reasonable time, we would
make the competition in Death Valley in the early fall, so its not
so very hot, but is very dry.  This means most of the payload
would be water.  Again to speed the competition, the walk
ends if the competitor stops for more than 5 minutes.  All the
competitors get a GPS receiver connected to a phone.  If
that receiver gets the same number for 4.5 minutes, a warning
tone sounds, and if it hasnt changed 30 seconds later, the
pickup crew is called.  This of course would preclude sleeping,
so the contest is unlikely to last more than about 30-40 hrs,
the winners having traveled perhaps 150 km.

Under those conditions, men and women could compete
equally, for it is unclear what advantage, if any, accrues to
the biggest.  Also, there may be an advantage to the tall
skinny people, for they would cover more real estate with
each step, yet throw off access heat efficiently, thereby
making the best use of their water and food.  For this
reason, it may be clear why I like this game.

Has anyone ideas or suggestions?  spike

Small rural communities differ from a transparent world in one huge way.  
People who live in small rural communities tend to have a common culture.  
They go to the same churches, belong to the same organizations and because 
the community is small, each member tends to have a much greater influence 
on his friends and neighbors than he would have living in, say, New York 
City.  Whereas in a ubiquitous transparent society, the culture would be an 
amalgam of many disparate cultures (again like you have in New York) and 
since no one culture will hold sway over any other, tolerance will be the 
natural result, as you have (for the most part) in New York.

Right!  It is *not* automatically true, we need to *make* it true.  Past
transparent societies have failed in this regard.  Transparency is increasing,
there is little we can do to reverse that.  There are no laws to stop people
from developing the technologies.  We must make it illegitimate and unethical
to oppress people for doing anything from S+M to good old fashioned
butt-scratching.

Society's values *can* be changed, even if it is a long, slow process.  As
transparency increases, we must compensate with fewer laws and fewer

manages to work out space hab modules, there will be very little privacy

Do you mean you created it on company time and with company resources?  If 
so, then unless you have an agreement with them to the contrary, it will be 
deemed to be a "work for hire" and the company owns it.  On the other hand 
if you created it on your own time, using your own resources and did not use 
it in anyway for the benefit of your employer, its yours.  Anything between 
these two extremes (and assuming you have no agreement with the employer 
specifying ownership) the answer is a definite "maybe."  Hope this helps.

Ive another thought on this.  In historical transparent societies, one reason
religious oppressors gained power is that the population consisted largely
of farmers.  They tended to be superstitious, believing that if evil existed
in the society, god would send plagues upon the sinners.  If god is plaguing
the wicked neighbor, he will be pissed at you too, for allowing the wickedness
to go on without stopping it.  Perhaps this time around we can at least be
free of that notion.  Since everyone can see that surveillance equipment is
getting faster, better, cheaper, ubiquitouser, etc, perhaps we can get our
society to *wake up* in time to arrange for most tolerant, individualistic and
freedom loving people among us be placed in positions of leadership.  spike

Right!  We as extropians may have been exactly wrong about one thing:
our notion that greater freedom comes from having freedom from religion.
Perhaps we need *more* religions, lots of different ones, lots of them that
are mutually exclusive!  That way, people can get all the religious fixes that
humans seem to need, yet there is plenty of evidence for anyone who cares
to see, that these ridiculous notions cannot *all* be true, but they definitely
*can* all be wrong.

Let us encourage all religions, and hope none of them get more popular
than the others, so there are a jillion little churches, all fighting for market

share.  "You guys worship buddha, you other guys worship yhwh, you
over there worship cucumbers..."  All with different rules of moral conduct
and none with a majority.  Welcome them all, and offer an alternative
for those who see the madness of it all.   spike

no, there should be heavily color-driven, geometric games where
average kinetic energy, and total capacity take stage center.  do the
olympics have to be knocked over in order to reoptimize and place new
games?  or are these games that we speak of already in place in

Knowing that we can't afford to pay sane people enough to entice them into
positions of leadership, many savvy extropians may elect to lead our own lives
in tolerant, free-form collaboration.

No, no! A high profile is fine, as long as it's very transparent. Trying to keep
secrets from the Singularity will make it do a HAL 9000 on you.

AI may not be the greatest barrier to robotic success. Someone needs to figure
out how to synthesize sanity (so we can mass produce it).

Submarine crews don't have much privacy, and they seem to get along all right.
That they are men-only probably doesn't explain *all* their success in this

Excerpt from US NEWS and WORLD REPORT: 
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/000828/trials.htm


The backbone of American medical research is broken. The 41,000 clinical 
trials now testing new treatments for humanity's plagues have been intensely 
scrutinized, after tragic mishaps last fall spurred concerns about patients' 
safety and researchers' reliability. The conclusions are devastating. Within 
the past week, a variety of critics have declared that trials are rife with 
conflicts of interest, that the analysis of women is inadequate, and that 
study results can be all but useless because so many patients lie when they 
claim to have followed instructions...

[I have suspected as much for years. Have can I not, what with the unending 
stream of seemingly contradictory studies that flood the media.
Surprising to see this story finally break, considering all the money at 
stake.]

...But over the long haul, to truly make human trials safer, more accurate, 
and faster, most experts agree that biotechnology that minimizes the use of 
humans as guinea pigs is the ideal solution.

[Now you're talking. How about cooking up some psuedo-humanoid brainless 
guinea pigs? ]


Already, new software makes it possible to simulate entire trials and answer 
many questions about a new therapy, without ever risking the health of a 
single person. But whether it's software or something not yet envisioned, 
it's clear that the current system has outlived its usefulness and is beyond 
repair.

Thats only half the problem.  The other half of the problem is
that the patients unintentionally forget the instructions.  The
third half of the problem is that patients dont really *know*
when they are doing something wrong or stupid, and the
more stupid the patient the more likely something goes wrong.

A couple years ago, I suggested developing a device of
some sort which would accurately measure all the inputs
into the body, and measure the results in some objective
fashion which is not dependent upon the unreliable
verbal communication channel.  Of course, some serious
info-nudists are required to make this happen.

The first step I have heard of in this direction is dna.com,
whereby the volunteer fills in a questionaire about your
medical history, then they set up an appointment, come
to your home, draw some blood, analyse the DNA,
and if enough volunteers step forward, a big picture
will begin to emerge.  Of course I volunteered, and
they are coming in a couple weeks for the blood.

If you wanna be part of that, goto www.dna.com.  spike

Yeah.  Probably has something to do with the fact that they are in the 
*military* and disorderly conduct and the like will quickly get you some 
brig time.  Not to mention the fact that if you are not into teamwork while 
doing sub duty you run the risk of living something akin to the recent Kursk 
nightmare.

Plus there's the hostage syndrome.  You know, Patty Hearst becoming an SLA 
revolutionary, etc.  People isolated in close quarters for long periods of 
time tend to bond (if they don't kill each other first).

Before you can produce it at all, you'll need to be able to produce a spec.
That's the really tough part.

    Tuesday August 8 2000
    A tiny, man-made island is causing an international incident, says
    Gary Slapper

    How a law-less 'data haven' is using law to protect itself

      When is a state not a state? When it is a playground on stilts in
      30ft of water, some might say, looking out at Sealand, the world's
      newest self-proclaimed state, off the Suffolk coast.

      The Government has apparently allowed itself to be painted into a
      corner over an intriguing issue of international law. A story that
      began in an apparently risible way in September 1967, and was
      nothing much more than a minor item of local news about a small
      eccentric family, has metamorphosed into an international incident.

[...]

      The commonly accepted criteria among jurists for determining
      whether an entity is a state are taken from the jus gentium - the
      law of nations. This law is derived from the Institutes of
      Justinian, the major treatise written by the command of the Roman
      Emperor Justinian and published in AD 533. One thorny problem for
      the Government is that according to the three major criteria of
      statehood, Sealand does appear to have a good claim.

      The requirements are: a national territory; a people coming
      together as a nation; and a sovereign state authority. It does not
      matter that it is only 932sq yd in size because there is no minimum
      area legally articulated for something to be a state. Vatican City
      is classified as a state even though it is minuscule. Neither is
      there a requirement that the population rises above a certain
      minimum. Nor is it an argument that the structure was created by
      the Government as it was legally terra nullis - abandoned land -
      when it was taken over.

      Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of
      States, signed in 1933, itemises the same criteria as the jus
      gentium, plus the capacity to enter into relations with other
      states. Sealand appears also to have satisfied this criterion. If
      Sealand is an independent state, it could legitimately claim its
      own coastal waters and regulate its own airspace. The Government is
      also in difficulties over this because on two occasions it has
      appeared to endorse the idea that Sealand is both beyond its
      jurisdiction and has the status of a state.

Cabine fever is a reality, and submarine crews only do manage to
function for a limited time, under military law. I'm sure if
occasionally things run less well than expected, it is not exactly
makes the news. Resident former army/navy people care to comment?

I've heard the Russians have been routinely screening the crew for
mutual compatibility for their long-term orbital missions (but they
still do rotate the rest of the crew). Also, astronauts are typically
kept occupied virtually 100% of the time -- not only because people
LEO time is expensive.

As to privacy, we automatically assume small, cramped quarters when we
talk about space. A near-closure lunar habitat must maintain a certain
ecology footprint for each team member if it to be sustainable, and
lunar material is cheap, as is oxygen produced from lunar rock. While
I'm not sure whether pressurizing (so far hypothetical) sublunar lava
tubes makes all that much sense, one could certainly imagine burying
an airlock-connected gridwork of metal cylinders in lunar rock (both
against radiation as a means to contain leaks) as habitat volume,
being constantly expanded.

Personally, I find recent news about development of a small lunar
rover melting regolith with a portable solar oven and sputtering
photovoltaics cells upon resulting glass sheets heartening. This is
still very far from being self-rep, but at least people are not blind
to local resources, anymore. A lunar factory can churn out a lot of
cubic meters of habitat before even first crew will move in.

What if I said they can surpass humans now in all categories, except for
other, as long as we put enough money into the hardware and software?

That's a good point and I think it takes us into "metaphysics". Do humans
have some kind of "psychic" ability beyond any physical structures and
functioning which would always put them on a higher level?

Not having a spec has not stopped anyone from producing other things --
albeit of low quality.

And that's the key.  Most people (the nukes, anyway) are hellishly
busy.  Constantly.  If you're not hellishly busy, you're trying to get a
few hours of sleep before your next thirty hour, randomly inserted into
the diurnal cycle, stretch.  Long periods underway really do turn into a
blur.


Everybody does not really get along.  Most people's nerves are shot,
depression is rampant, and privacy longed for. But (God, I can't believe
I'm sounding like this) all this takes a back seat to getting the job
done.  Don't know how well that'd translate into a civilian culture where
everyone has this delusion of "rights."

OK, Spike. Your suggestion of a new sport seems fun (eventhough a bit 
unclear).

But remember that one of the improvement for the "traditional" sports wich 
hasn't been allowed (and even outlawed) is the modification of the athletes 
in chemical and biological ways.
That could put even more fun into the games.

Sincerely,

Waldemar

In my experience, private cliques, rather than individual privacy issues, have
contributed most to social problems. Whether ID implants help or hinder societal
evolution will depend IMO on whether humans can overcome tribal instincts which
precipitate conflict.

Not having a spec has not stopped anyone from producing other things --

N - I had another couple ideas about beauty ...relating to advances in 
biotech engineering technology and life extension ...conceptual factors
part one:
youth = beauty 
the mythology of "a short life"

Will increased life span and/or immortality make old age attractive in new 
ways?

For now, we are mostly interested in youth. A plain person can be famous as a 
beauty (see any of the teen idols today) if they are just young enough.  
Women (including myself) seem far more preoccupied with "looking" young than 
men, at this time. Especially good looking ones. For youth is beauty.

Of course, this is because prime mating time is early twenties for both men 
and women, and particularly in women. This is perhaps why elderly men are 
allowed to have gray hair and jowls on TV while their co-host counterparts 
have hairdressers and more facelift needs. Some men can still have babies 
even in "ugly" decrepitude, if they can convince a woman young enough to 
accept such a path.

Is this enough? No. Men still hate to look old, and so succumbing to the 
embarrassing "mid-life crisis" syndrome associated with the dreaded male 
passage out of the hard body youth image - resisting transforming into those 
balding, secondary sexual male bellies and wrinkled, puffy faces they see in 
the mirror. Hoping to look young, feel young again, people do comb-overs, 
work out relentlessly, apply cosmetics, even buy sassy little convertibles 
and young lovers, ever aspiring to regain that elusive youth. Proving to 
ourselves that we still have some "juice".\

Of course not everyone, for many age gracefully and/or resist aging in 
sensible ways, taking care of themsleves and being lovely emotionally well 
balanced people. Beauty is always inside anyway. The outside is merely a 
reflection, is it not?

With biological tinkering allowing women the option of childbirth at later 
and later in life, and men the option of staying at levels of endurance that 
early youth fondly brings, the mating window will open, as will the career, 
and the beauty window. Even today the strict ageist barriers are coming down 
and sex symbols being harmonious with middle age, Nick Nolte and Lauren 
Hutton for examples.

With the advent of longevity, perhaps youth (the power of longevity) will go 
out of fashion. Perhaps enduring and mastering a long passing of time will be 
seen as beauty, and the evidence of time - not hormone loss - but character, 
wisdom, grace, knowledge and poise- will give one "beauty"...


20th centurions may become highly sought after individuals: ancient, rare, 
complex and exotic, compared to the new crops of baby immortals who never had 
to face dying, never knew what it was like.

Okay, we'd better get started then.

The need to define sanity indicates a desire to prove ourselves sane.

But the whole history of humanity proves that humanity lacks sanity as much
as it lacks anything. Basically, humanity proves itself insane by fighting
five thousand wars in the last three thousand years. The greed, jealousy,
and selfishness that prevails throughout human social orders indicates the
dominance of something other than sanity.

Sane people exult in doing what comes naturally, in satisfying a congenital
appetite for the beauty of reason, the thrill of understanding, the
excitement of knowing reality directly.

A wise man once defined sanity as "coming out of the mind into the open,
into the silence, where no thought, no desire disturbs you. In that pool of
silence, with not a single ripple upon it, sanity abides."

Sanity means to secure your happiness, and by extension, the happiness of
your neighbors, family, friends, and community, since one cannot really feel
happy when surrounded by misery.

When your means fulfill your ends, if you can manage that -- the harmony
between the means and the end -- then you've got sanity. When your means
don't satisfy your end, and you continue to repeat the same means, never
arriving at a gratifying end, then you've got a neurosis. "Make every act of
your life dedicated to love and sanity arises out of it," a romantic man has
said.

When liberated people want to play the game of sanity, they live as sanely
as anyone can live. Then they can outdo Aristotle with logic and reason.
They can follow every rule and regulation. But if they want to play the
lunatic game, then they can become as demagogic, theologic, and ideologic as
any other maniac.


The perfectly sane brain thinks only when necessary. It reverts to ecstatic
tranquility (i.e., it allows  thought-noise to dissipate, clearing the way
for the emergence of superlative sentience or learning) whenever it can, for
as long as it can. Conversely, the insane brain cannot stop chattering.

A psychologist asked a psychonomer, "How do you deal with neurotics?"

The psychonomer replied, "We trap them?"

"Oh? And how do you do that?" asked the psychologist.

"By making it impossible for them to ask any more questions," answered the
psychonomer.

Low-quality sanity corresponds to simple minded sanity.
So, high-quality sanity would correspond to highly evolved and complex
knowledge.
It's easy to be sane when you don't know anything.

The device would need to be "tiny" indeed, since the microtubules which connect

Hi Extropians,

As I am not very knowledgeable about this organization, could familiar
members comment on the organization's viewpoint. It's a very chilling one.

Thanks

Yes, definitely.  The term old age will change and new phrasing such as
young-old, which is already in use, will soon prop up along with many other
words and terms to describe those who enjoy increased life span and
youthfulness.  But this is of course just a beginning.

The concept of youth can be a bit misleading because youthfulness is indeed
desirous, but youth as in looking young is not necessarily alluring.  I do
not find young looking males particularly attractive or sexual, but find
the deeper age much more alluring and beautiful -- meaning I am physically
and emotionally attracted to a bloom than a blossom.  Same for females.

In a world of depth, but not always.  Although I prefer to blend the inner
and outer beauty, the visual image and what catches the eye is the physical
appearance, and I rather enjoy admiring beauty on many animals.

When individuals can pick and choose what we want to look like, striving
for beauty will no longer be such a major preoccupation because physical or
non-biologically physical beauty can be easily achieved.  When it is no
longer such a preoccupation, other elements of an individual or entity will
take precedence.  I find it similar to achieving a goal.  Once the goal is
achieved, I look for the next goal.  I don't think it is a small matter or
a wasteful preoccupation to want to be youthful, vigorous and attractive
just as I don't think it is a needless preoccupation to want to be
intelligent, creative, generous, kind and successful.  More people
preoccupy their time trying to make money than trying to be beautiful. 

I don't think youthfulness will become passe or beauty out of vogue, just
as I don't think we have any idea now what will become future cultural
preferences other than making projections based on potential evolutionary
trends.  One thing I do know is that most people tend to appreciate (with
awe) a beautiful sunset.

Relics of the past are unique.  A wonderful book to read which covers some
relics of the past is _An Underground Education_ by Richard Zacks.  I'll
confess, I don't find the relics of some of the past very exotic - but
horribly stricken by the constraints and unhealthy environments in which
they resided.  

My mother, in her mid-80s, is beautiful because she is both lovely and
generous.   I don't, however, look at her with rose-colored glasses.  Her
mind causes her to be irritable and impatient, but I know that she cannot
help what goes on in her mind.  She is a young-old person who is frustrated
that she cannot produce ideas as she once did or to be as mentally
adventurous.  I don't find this aspect of her beautiful, but very sad that
she, presently, cannot grow beyond her mental limitations.  What I do
appreciate enormously is that she has survived much.

Hi All,

As someone who works in the dot com, health media industry, I have to say
that even Extropians have only begun to scratch the surface of what Life
Extension and Radical Health opportunities are already available.

In addition to supplements, there are a host of herbs which have not been
subject to scientific study. The few herbs which clinically have been
proven effective for different conditions, such as green tea, ginsing,
ginko biloba, st johns wort, etc. are only a few.

Thosands of years of trial-and-error with "mythological attribution of
effects" has discovered some natural substances which may or may not have
clinical properties. With the addition of scientific methodology, we have
the ability to assess these substances, and discover their scientific
mchanisms of action.


> Yes, definitely.  The term old age will change and new phrasing such as
> young-old, which is already in use, will soon prop up along with many other

> youthfulness. 

It is certainly time for new Immortalist and Life Extension-ist memes and
metaphors!

*In addition, there are several body-modalities, which have often been
popularized in "new age wrappers" which are physical practices to prolong
life and improve health. Because of the pseudo-religious sales-pitch used
to promote these methods, Extropians haven't turned-on to them yet, but
these include.... karatie, massage, yoga, hot-tubs, saunas, and various
forms of bodywork including the Feldenkris method, and neuro-muscular
repatterning.

Be Well!

Neuro-muscular repatterning is a form of bodywork. Muscles are extended,
allowing them to fully return to an unused position. I don't know much
about physiology, so that might not be accurate. But the theory is that
through this very rough form of massage, habitual movement patters are
interrupted, thus breaking habits and patterns. I did five or six
sessions of this a year ago for stress, and found it to be a profoundly
altering experience.

Through movement exercises, visualization, and hands-on techniques you will
learn repatterning for functional problems that can be the underlying cause of
chronic physical stress. You will learn the kinesiological principles that
govern coordination to improve all movement from the everyday to the most
demanding skill. Sessions will draw from the neuromuscular education disciplines
of Laban Movement Analysis, Bartenieff Fundamentals, the Alexander Technique,
and Ideokinesis.

In earlier research Krasnow noted two well-known practices in use for dance
training. One is a collection of somatic practices known as body therapies which
emphasize neuromuscular repatterning: that is, their focus is to alter alignment
or movement habits by addressing how the brain sends messages to the muscles.
"The body therapies, such as the Alexander Technique and Sweigard's Ideokinesis,
put the emphasis on whole body integration and connections," she explains. "The
other is physical conditioning practices, which address specific muscles and
physical structures. These methods include activities like weight-training."
What Krasnow attempts to do is combine the potential benefits of each into her
C-I Training program.

OK, Ill be more specific.  I am interested to see how far a person
can walk or run given the person must carry everything needed
and no stopping.

I have already begun to plan an optimal strategy.  I hiked about
15 miles today thinking about it.  First thing I need is a thobe, one
of those flowing white thingies that the sheik-ey type Saudi
Arabians wear in the desert.  Then I need to figure out a way to
carry about 30-35 pounds, but a simple backpack wont do, nor
a fanny pack, but maybe both together might be the ticket.  I
figure I should be good for about 25-30 hrs or so.  My goal is to
traverse 100 km in that time.

You guys that are cluey on GPS, is there a device available
that can mark and store a position about every minute for
at least 30 hrs?  How much does it weigh?

Anybody know where a man might purchase a thobe?
Any ideas on how to carry about 10 liters of water or
sports drink?

I remember watching TV when some of those sheik-ey types surrendered to GIs
wearing T-shirts and camo pants in the Persian Gulf desert. Extreme hikers would
do better, I think, by discarding the fashionable throbe and going for something
more practical (unless, of course, this new sport involves some kind of ethnic
devolutionary regimentation).

Is an Arakis still-suit permissible? In fact, is such a thing yet
technically feasible? I assume this would be a closed garment that used
incident and body heat to evaporate sweat, capture it (and urine) and
somehow sequester the wastes, returning warm water via a mouth tube,
capillary flow presumably powered by the motion of the limbs.

"The waste is processed using pumps that are powered by the legs while walking."
[no capillary action required]
" ...reverse osmosis is probably a more viable method using the power of walking
to drive pumps. Along with rebreather technologies being developed by the US
navy, explorers could survive in hostile environments longer carrying only food.
Along with similar technologies being used in the spacecraft, this allows for
significant reduction in basic supplies required. Some of these properties are
probably available in existing space suits but more work should go into
extending the time someone can survive on their own."

My intuition suggests that there is a thermodynamics problem with this,
at least as far as keeping the body cool goes.  In a hot climate, sweat
would either have to be collected before it evaporates (preventing the
cooling effect) or the evaporated sweat would have to re-radiate the heat
it has absorbed (impossible to do passively if the ambient temperature is
above the body temperature), again effectively negating the cooling
effect.  Actively powered systems would work, but defeat the purpose. 
Basically, wearing such a system would be like wearing a wetsuit on a hot
summer day; you would overheat very quickly.

Which illustrates the point of why we sweat in the first place; if it was
not a priority for survival, the body would conserve water and keep
us hydrated instead.

Could you carry a well-shielded container of near-zero K helium (or
whatever) across which the evaporated sweat passes? Would this be
mass-cost-effective compared with carrying water? Is the required thermal
shielding too heavy? Yes, clearly you'd need a powered system at *some*
point to re-freeze the coolant, but maybe this would get you further than a
bag of H2O you have to piss away?

I've done a fair amount of desert hiking (including a solo hike across Joshua 
Tree in late July without caches and in about 54 hours) and quite naturally 
thought a good bit about equipment.  For clothing, I prefer army surplus 
desert pants.  They fit loosely, have conveniently placed pockets, and tie 
about the ankles to avoid snags on brush.  For shirts, I've purchased 
light-colored, long-sleeved, buttoned shirts from a "tall and big" store.  
It's more important to get cover from the sun than to expose your skin to the 
air, and the loose fit allows pretty good circulation.  The buttons and long 
sleeves allow you to regulate heat loss with the widely varying desert 
temperatures, too.

I've experimented with a couple of hats, neither of which I rate as ideal.  
The standard-issue army desert cap works OK, but has a fairly narrow brim 
that won't protect you from sidelong light and reflected glare.  I thus 
currently prefer a modified baseball-style cap.  I've ironed a dark, 
glare-reducing patch to the underside of the bill and attached over the top a 
sort of loose hood that drapes about the sides of my head and neck.  It's 
white cotton; silk would work better.  The hat would also ideally have more 
"loft" room to allow heat to rise off of my head.

A good backpack (and back) can easily manage 35 pounds.  The water goes 
there, natch.  A fanny pack won't make much difference in poundage, though it 
can prove convenient.  Pocket will do the same, though.

SoCal Extropians interested in desert hikes ought to email me privately.  
I've got a kick-ass Joshua Tree hike mapped out that will go from the 
Colorado Sonoran Desert, over the park's southern range through 
high-elevation forests, and back down into the Mohave desert.  It'll take a 
couple of cars to set up and two or three tough days to accomplish.

The article is correct in all its scientific details, as far as I can 
tell.  I minored in Biochemistry in college and learned some 
gene-splicing technologies which are now out of date.  Programming 
DNA is very much like programming a computer.  There are often 
unexpected side-effects.  I believe that the big companies have 
lobbied the FDA to ignore scientific questions that remain, and have 
gotten permission to skip drug trials that would be required of new 
food additives.  The descriptions of the the processes in the article 
are correct.  Nature swaps around major pieces of DNA, and does not 
insert random genes in random sequence.  We are doing much more 
precise tampering than is possible in nature.  Such gene splicing 
techniques take years to develop, because early attempts often have 
catastrophic unexpected failures.  Usually these are in the form of 
complete death or obvious defomation of the crops.

I am personally in favor of programming our own food, our own bodies, 
and our own brains.  But, I am very afraid of our current inability 
to produce perfectly flawless designs.  Until our computers stop 
crashing, our toys stop breaking, and our entertainment industry 
stops producing flops, I fear that our ability to design and predict 
the results of our tampering is not robust enough to bet my life on.

I like that definition.
High-quality sanity would (in contrast to low-quality sanity) exhibit robust
adaptability and resilience. In addition, it would tolerate exposure to various
chemical and physiological insults as well as intense stimulation via sensory
input (and sensory deprivation).

I wonder if "femtochemical movies" could help.

See Coherent Thinking:
http://broccoli.caltech.edu/EngineeringAndScience/articles/zewail/zewailtxt.html

<<In order to shoot bonds in sharp focus, you need a shutter speed faster than
the fastest atomic motion. Explains Zewail, "A femtosecond is shorter than the
period of any nuclear vibration or rotation in the molecule, so we are able to
freeze the system in time. The atoms in the molecules inside you are vibrating
at about a kilometer per second, and they're so tiny that we measure their
relative positions in a unit called the angstrom, which is 10-10 meters-one
ten-billionth of a meter. A typical chemical bond is a few angstroms long. If
you combine these numbers, you see it takes about 100 femtoseconds for an atom
to move an angstrom. So we have to be substantially faster than that to catch
them in the act." And then there's the daunting task of getting all the
molecules in step. When Eadweard Muybridge took his groundbreaking stop-motion
photos of a galloping horse in 1887, one horse was ridden past a row of a dozen
cameras. But each of Zewail's photographs contains millions of molecules, as if
Muybridge had run a whole herd of horses in lock step past one camera. Even when
they are undergoing the same reaction, molecules don't run in lock step, so how
do you synchronize their gaits? >>

The peculiar epistemology used by Hubbard involved long, long lists of 
definitions of terms - defined very differently than their common usage.  A 
couple of decades ago, I picked up a set of Hubbard's "serious" works at 
some garage sale, and took a look at how he thought.  My impression was that 
the definitions and concepts he used were themselves part of the programming 
that scientologists receive, and that none of it was accidental.

A normal definition, as we non-scientologists use the term, consists of a 
super-set - say "animal" - and then the criteria which distinguishes the 
subset named from other members of the superset - as in "rational" for the 
term human - "a rational animal."

Hubbard's definitions, as I recall, were more of the form: "human" - "an 
unaware Thetan," altho I just made up that particular example.  Like a nazi 
defining a Jew, not by the religious heritage, but as "a subhuman enemy of 
all humanity," Hubbard included his personal opinions and evaluations in the 
definitions and often used them as the essential defining characteristics of 
a term.  I do recall that I was impressed that many of his definitions did 
seem to strike at a core of meaning that Websters would not consider, but 
that still leaves the problem of the many that appeared to be simply 
imposing an evaluation.

Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness to accept 
such nonsense as part of the "training," could easilly lose all grip on 
reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.  Out of consistency, 
they would feel obligated to act in accordence with the conclusions that 
would follow, once having accepted the epistemology and the conceptual set - 
however bizarre those conclusions might be.

I don't know much about Scientology other than what I've seen on the
internet. but I've known a person who practiced it and lived for a while in
their Florida community.  This person was one of the most disturbing
individuals I've ever talked to.  Whenever he spoke of a topic related to
Scientology (and as their training is broad, many things in daily life seem
to be related to Scientology) he would begin to speak in a monotone, as
though he were reciting words that had been fed into his mind under
hypnosis.  Some of the stuff they believe would ordinarily be pretty funny,
but it was a bit frightening to see someone taking it so seriously. If I
tried to reason with this person, for example by pointing out internal
inconsistencies in his bullshit, he would change the subject and refuse to
even consider the idea the Ron Hubbard might have been wrong, even about the
smallest item. The CoS had even taken a huge sum of money from this person
through fraud, and he himself said that he'd been defrauded. I think they
even kicked him out of the church when he asked for his money back, and even
though he'd been so shabbily treated, his greatest desire seemed to be to
get back into the Church.  It was quite pathetic.

I don't think the CoS is any worse than other religions, but all religions
have the potential of being deadly, and this one seems more dangerous than
many others because it's on the rise, in its fanatic stage rather than being
a mature religion.

There is no hypnosis practiced in Scientology.  People learn by the unique
method of reading books and being tested on what they've read.  The most
esoteric thing they do is have people model key concepts in clay as part of
the test.

This is frightening, folks.  You all seem fairly objective and level headed
on most subjects... but on this one, I'd have to give the whole list an "F".

Scientology is silly.  It's eastern religion altered by a science fiction
writer to take on the trappings of a "scientific" belief system.

However... they don't hypnotize people, they don't tear families apart and
they don't eat babies.  They ARE over litigious and a bit paranoid... but
they have ample reason to be that way.  They have real enemies that use real
nasty tactics.

The cult of christianity in all it's forms, from catholics to mormons, is
much much worse.  You are wasting time and energy on the wrong target.

Loree

P.S.  I've never met any scientologist who behaved like you describe,
Barbara.  I have met massive numbers of christians who fit that description,
however.

I'll bet we all have.

It means that between the hours of 8 am and 9 pm, you can park there a 
maximum of 15 minutes; it also implies that between the hours of 9 pm and 8 
am, there is no time limit.

The World Trade Center has lots of bronze-looking engraved signs
reading "No trespassing violators will be prosecuted." That sounded
like a rather friendly policy till I did a double take and put
the comma in.

What do you think it the fastest way to get from here to there -- there
being a world where the nanotechnology Singularity has happened?  (Is it
good to take the fastest route?)

I think we can choose paths where we go from simple stuff that works --
building a tugboat that floats as opposed to an ocean liner that sinks -- at
first and spreading that.  We might also try to use the market: build stuff
that targets areas that will pay a lot -- be financially profitable -- and
use not only those profits to produce more but also to attract other
investors (in terms of both money and skills; researchers invest their time
and talent, right?) to the field, ones that currently aren't involved.

What do you think?

Speed is one concern.  Quality is another.  If you concentrate just on
getting nanotech developed...well, a world that has dissolved into grey
goo *does* have nanotech.

That being said, the sooner nanotech can be developed and gotten into
the general public knowledge base, the less time any lone crazy or small
group of people seeing the world as their enemy - i.e., just about the
only type who would deliberately destroy the world - will have to
develop nanotech on their own.

That is definitely one avenue worth pursuing, though in order to play
the market, you'll have to be able to convince investors that you're
close enough to something that will sell well - say, being able to mass
produce reliable, useful, and commercially feasable quantum or molecular
computers - that their investment will carry you the rest of the way.
You'd also have to worry about competition, though if you will be doing
much more extensive development than just repeating other peoples'
experiments, patents may be able to help (this being exactly the kind of
situation they were designed for).

I'm actually thinking of using this process myself, but in another field
- cybernetics - where I think I may be able to more easily assemble the
resources and develop the products needed to get a business going.  But
the field choice is just due to my own circumstances; there are
undoubtedly people who would personally find this easier for nano than
for cyber.

Just to throw in my two cents, I concur with what Tom suggested.  I've
spent a lot of time in the deep desert and dress in a similar fashion,
with minor differences.  A big thumbs up for the military surplus desert
pants.  However, I would recommend selecting the lightweight cotton
ripstop fabric instead of the heavier polyester/cotton fabric.  The
polyester blend provides much better insulation and doesn't breathe as
well, whereas the ripstop cotton is designed for hot weather use at the
expense of durability.  Both fabrics are military issue and are used for
all standard military patterns.  I personally go for straight khaki color,
without a desert camo pattern.

For shirts, I use long-sleeve cotton mock turtlenecks in a light color. 
However, actually finding one of these shirts in a lightweight fabric with
a loose cut takes some searching, as most people assume turtlenecks will
be worn in cold weather and design them accordingly.  Occasionally, I will
wear two layers of shirts, a relatively tight inner one (e.g. a cotton
tshirt) and a baggy button-down outer layer.

There are actually multiple "army issue" caps, so I am not sure which one
is being referred to.  I personally use military issue "boonie" hats,
though I tend to put the sides up using the retention strap.  I've found
this to work reasonably well for me, giving me front and back cover in the
way that I wear it and keeping the head cool quite well (it has vents near
the top).  I do wear appropriate sunglasses, so glare is not too much of a
problem.

And plenty of water.

I've settled on this general configuration for most of my desert time. 
The most extreme conditions I've put this through was four days in the
desert south of Tucson, Arizona last summer with the temperature doing
120+F during the day.  Hot but comfortable.

The fact that Monarch butterflies are killed by GM wheat is a minor 
concern.  The real issue is that the wheat was designed to be safe to 
butterflies, but turned out to be unsafe for them.  Obviously, the 
original design was flawed in some way.  Trusting GM foods to be safe 
is like trusting Microsoft products to be secure.  Past history tells 
us they aren't.

This doesn't mean throw away all computers or all GM foods.  But 
claiming that a particular technology is always harmless is just 
blind faith.

One thought is that we don't have to produce all our own new content. 
There are a lot of educational programs that have covered science, 
genetics, biology, psychology, computers, etc.  We could get replay 
rights to these and have a mix of new and repeat programming on 
appropriate subjects.

Yes. I argued what I take to be your point on this

Perhaps your references will prove informative and
therefore persuasive.

Thank you for posting this, Greg.

Harvey:
       You are far more up-to-date than me with my doctoral area defense
and dissertation in behaviour genetics from 1971. Could you please tell us
how the A-G, T-C sequence in DNA profiling compares to the older notion of
a "gene profile"? Is a gene locus now an AREA on the double helix with a
number of A-G, T-C sequences? Is an allele more than one A-G, T-C set?

I had a chance to briefly meet Ralph Merkle last week at the Crypto
conference.  (Ralph, in addition to being a nanotech pioneer, was
a co-founder of public key cryptography back in the 1970s).  I know
many list members know him, but I was suprised at how friendly and open
he was.  I think we may have been the only two cryonics subscribers at
the conference.

He was chatting about nano with some other folks, and there was discussion
of the MEMS approach to nanotech (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems,
basically microtech).  This is similar to the original Feynman conception,
little tools which make smaller ones.  You'd use MEMS devices to help
position, organize and convey the smaller nanotech elements which might
be produced by conventional chemistry.

It's kind of a vague conception, but it is economically attractive
because there are a lot of commercial applications for MEMS and they
are technically feasible right now.  You could envision a succession of
ever smaller MEMS devices until the field overlaps with nanotech.

No, no and no.

Not only can I not answer your "questions", I can't even understand 
how they could come from a PhD.

Did I pass your test?

It's not a test. If the only sequencing on DNA is A bonded to G at site x
or T bonded to C at a site, then I just assume that a DNA sequence would
be A-G or T-C sequences. That would be a DNA profile. Just asking. Anybody
else?

BTW, anyone heard of or from Laurence Gale lately?  He was one of the 
original founders of Alcor (originally Manrise), quite  smart guy.  Then he 
disappeared as far as I've heard - nothing since the mid-80's.

Anyway, reason I thot of Laurence:  He was once fairly high up in the 
Dianetics Org in England, had gone "clear" long before, was an auditor.  
Then he returned to the U.S. and introduced himself to the U.S. local 
scientology organization, where they informed him, after standard testing, 
that he had all kinds of engrams, etc., and would have to start over from 
zero.  He decided that this pretty well demonstrated that any claim to 
scientific validity on their part had been reduced to near zero and left 
instead.

I notice that you seem to have somehow forgotten "auditing," or are they no 
longer doing that?

I've known a couple of former auditors, who described the procedure briefly. 
  Basically, you hold on to two tin cans, which are the inputs to the 
"E-Meter," which is a glorified skin resistance meter, as in the little 
lie-detector kits you could buy from Radio Shack.  The auditor asks you a 
set of standardized questions and watches the E-Meter responses for 
indications of tension related to a topic.  Tension indicates an internal 
state of conflict.  Once the exact nature and source of the tension has been 
isolated and identified, the person is asked to make a choice to do 
something about the problem.  Only when the person has genuinely committed 
to positively resolving the underlying problem - as indicated by the 
reduction of tension - are they allowed to continue.

Thru many, many expensive auditings, a person is lead systematically to 
resolve all the internal contradictions and conflicts in their lives, until 
they are "clear."  At this point, nothing budges the needle on the E-Meter.

While this methodology sounds very good, and seems to work reasonably well 
in practice, at least initially, in straitening out conflicted persons' 
lives, the drawbacks and problems are severalfold.  Here are a few of the 
obvious problems:

First, it is very well established that the galvanic skin response is 
extremely easy to condition.  Thus, a person can learn to control the meter 
without even realizing they are, just by the conditioning of the process 
itself.  Thus, going clear may simply indicate a person has learned to 
control his GSR, not that anything has been solved.

Second, pathological lyers, sociopaths, psychotics, CIA and KGB agents, 
among other nice people, are notorious for being able to ace much more 
sophisticated polygraph tests, from training or pathology (or both).  These 
people may well quickly move to "clear" and become star members of any 
organization that relies upon anything like an E-Meter - which could explain 
some of the internal problems and purges I've heard rumors of from the 
scientologists I currently know.

Third, the guidance by the auditor itself may lead or coerce the person into 
decisions and acceptances that are contrary to reason or their real 
interests, and may be a major part of a process of real hypnosis.  See 
"Explorations in Hypnosis," for a good explanation for how the process of 
hypnosis actually works - and it does.  It always requires the person to 
first accept some minor breach with reality, which has the effect of 
disconnecting the critical faculties.

I saw an even worse one today.  The local cop car had a big sign saying:

STAY BACK, Police Dog.

Nowthen, Im sure the boys in blue are frustrated from the K9 hoisting
a leg on the tires once too often, but they should know that dogs cant
read.   spike

Of course they can read. How else could Police Dog have signed his name?

If he was really a "smart guy" it would not require such a demonstration for him
to figure out that CoS was an L. Ron Hubbard joke that got out of control.
Hubbard created CoS because he was pissed off that churches don't have to pay
tax. So he invented his own church to confound the System. When his "church"
started making millions, he fell for his own line of voodoo-scientific claptrap.

Guess the whole theory of "Be public and open, so that you have some
influence in how things go" turned out to be a load of horse hockey. 
Nice-sounding theory, didn't work in practice.  Drexler gambled and
lost.

As Galileo could have told you, being public and open can get you in trouble.

A Pinch of Salt

WHEN a dream is born in you 
With a sudden clamorous pain, 
When you know the dream is true 
And lovely, with no flaw nor strain, 
O then, be careful, or with sudden clutch 
You'll hurt the delicate thing you prize so much. 

Dreams are like a bird that mocks, 
Flirting the feathers of his tail. 
When you sieze at the salt box, 
Over the hedge you'll see him sail. 
Old birds are neither caught with salt nor chaff: 
They watch you from the apple bough and laugh. 

Poet, never chase the dream. 
Laugh yourself and turn away. 
Mask your hunger; let it seem 
Small matter if he come or stay; 
But when he nestles in your hand at last, 
Close up your fingers tight and hold him fast. 

Robert Graves

A hundred years ago, that was true.  A hundred years from now, it will
be true again.  It is not true right now.

Hmmm... close, but not exact.

Auditing has nothing at all to do with training... two different areas
completely.

About the only thing that approaches the type of auditing you describe are
ethics sessions... but those are VERY rare.

99% of auditing is asking the person to recall incidents of past emotional
or physical pain (the infamous engrams) and if after going over it a few
times the response on the e-meter doesn't diminish in intensity, that is an
indication that there is an earlier, similar incident... so you have them go
back to the earliest incident of a particular type.  That, btw, is how
people end up "recalling" incidents in past lives.

Once a person is "clear" (no engrams?), the auditing becomes a self directed
thing... there is no auditor, you do it yourself, holding the cans in one
hand and using the other to adjust the meter to keep your response in
range...

These standard questions are written on a work sheet... these are the "OT"
(operating thetan) levels.

I'm not really sure exactly what the meter is reacting to on the OT
levels... the stuff sounds so silly it's completely unbelievable... souls
(thetans) being trapped by advanced electronic means and implanted with
desires for physical bodies... happening long long ago in a galaxy far far
away.

It really doesn't much matter how you try and twist it, there isn't any type
of brainwashing going on.  What is there is information (mostly non true...
and non verifiable) being presented and then the real experience of
auditing.

The package was slick enough to hold my interest for two or 3 years in my
youth... but in the end it was still just a bunch of people operating on
faith, like any other religion.  I could have spent those years at an ashram
and gotten just as much out of it.

As far as ethics investigations go... the E-meter is a very very inaccurate
lie detector.  Nobody with any brains thinks that it actually works as one.

Real lie detectors don't work very well.

Where is Halperin's truth machine anyway?

If you attempt to bypass the mainstream, you should not be surprised

Also assuming a test was actually an accurate reflection of reality is just
blind faith as well. A better test would be to go around, do a count of
butterflies in the area, then collect all the dead butterflies found. Such in
situ research is far more accurate than force feeding ONLY collected milkweed to
test butterflies. The force feeding prevents the butterflies from making a
choice as to what plants to eat from, thus altering actual mortality rates. Give
a starving man bread with rat poison in it, he'll eat the bread...

Since I've seen camping coolers that use a small solar panel to power a solid
state cooling device, I would imagine that a still suit would have PV devices to
power the cooling of collected water by similar means...

I realize that in the pre-Nazi Germany the philosopher
Max Scheler clearly saw the danger of the fascist tendencies
(youth movement, radical conservatives) and of the dictatorial
tendencies (Marxism, Nazi).

He pictured an integration of vital drive and spirit:
the Allmensch, the Total-Man.

"The man who is most deeply rooted in the darkness of the earth
and nature....... the man who, simultaneously, as a spiritual person,
in his consciousness of self, reaches the outmost heights of the
luminous world of ideas, that man is approaching the idea of Total-Man,
and wherewith, the idea of the substance of the very source of the world,
through a constantly growing interpenetration of spirit and drive."
(Scheler)

"The person who thinks most deeply, loves what is most alive." (Hoelderlin)

So the process of a universal, cosmic becoming in time has two
increasingly mutually penetrating poles:
an uncreated vital drive, or impulsion, and spirit.
Without life, which is the form of impulsion, spirit is shown to be
impotent to bring anything into existence. Spirit needs realizing factors
such as life-conditions, history, economics, geo-politics, social and
geographic conditions that make possible for spirit to realize ideas with
them.

This Total-Man (Allmensch) seems quite different from Nietzsche's
Transhuman (Ubermensch) and perhaps similar to the Renaissance
concept (Leonardo da Vinci & co.).

Anyway I really do not know how much these
speculations are useful.

Extropians,

	I noticed in the review of "Seeping With Extra-Terrestrials:
The Rise of Irrationalism and Perils of Piety" by Wendy Kaminer at the
Amazon.com page for this <URL:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067944243X/extropyinstitute/>
has the following comment:

	I take this comment against '"cyberspacy" claims made by
boosters of technological progress.' to indicate this book isn't to
hot on extropianism?  I plan on getting and reading the book some time
to see what it has to say about this, but I wonder if any of you know
what is contained on this topic in this book and if any of you had any
thoughts or comments.

Very true.  It is easy to have blind faith on both sides of an issue. 
Most people agree with whichever side their on.  I'm afraid that I 
see both sides of most issues being totally unscientific, citing 
whatever references help their case, and ignoring the ones that 
dispute their case.  It is very rare to find a truly impartial 
observer.

Actually this metaphor is really GOOD for blind faith. While optimistic and 
excited about genetic engineering for obvious reasons, I am amused at the 
level of gung-honess displayed here about GM. A crappy corperation that can't 
get cereal right, and this list defends them tooth and nail because JUST LIKE 
starving men, we want this technology to keep us alive.

ones I want to be true.


VANDANA SHIVA


      Recently, I was visiting Bhatinda in Punjab because of an epidemic of 
      farmer suicides. Punjab used to be the most prosperous agricultural 
      regionin India. Today every farmer is in debt and despair. Vast 
      stretches of land have become water-logged desert. And as an old 
      farmer pointed out, even the trees have stopped bearing fruit because 
      heavy use of pesticides have killed the pollinators - the bees and 
      butterflies.
      And Punjab is not alone in experiencing this ecological and social 
      disaster. Last year I was in Warangal, Andhra Pradesh where farmers 
      have also been committing suicide. Farmers who traditionally grew 
      pulses and millets and paddy have been lured by seed companies to buy 
      hybrid cotton seeds referred to by the seed merchants as "white 
      gold", which were supposed to make them millionaires. Instead they 
      became paupers.
      Their native seeds have been displaced with new hybrids which cannot 
      be saved and need to be purchased every year at high cost. Hybrids 
      are also very vulnerable to pest attacks. Spending on pesticides in 
      Warangal has shot up 2000 per cent from $2.5 million in the 1980s to 
      $50 million in 1997. Now farmers are consuming the same pesticides as 
      a way of killing themselves so that they can escape permanently from 
      unpayable debt.
      The corporations are now trying to introduce genetically engineered 
      seed which will further increase costs and ecological risks. That is 
      why farmers like Malla Reddy of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers' Union had 
      uprooted Monsanto's genetically engineered Bollgard cotton in 
      Warangal.
      On March 27th, 25 year old Betavati Ratan took his life because he 
      could not pay pack debts for drilling a deep tube well on his two-
      acre farm. Thewells are now dry, as are the wells in Gujarat and 
      Rajasthan where more than 50 million people face a water famine.
      The drought is not a "natural disaster". It is "man-made". It is the 
      result of mining of scarce ground water in arid regions to grow 
      thirsty cash crops for exports instead of water prudent food crops 
      for local needs.
      It is experiences such as these which tell me that we are so wrong to 
      be smug about the new global economy. I will argue in this lecture 
      that it istime to stop and think about the impact of globalisation on 
      the lives of ordinary people. This is vital to achieve sustainability.
      Seattle and the World Trade Organisation protests last year have 
      forced everyone to think again. Throughout this lecture series people 
      have referred to different aspects of sustainable development taking 
      globalisation for granted. For me it is now time radically to re-
      evaluate what we are doing. For what we are doing in the name of 
      globalisation to the poor is brutal and unforgivable. This is 
      specially evident in India as we witness the unfolding disasters of 
      globalisation, especially in food and agriculture.
      Who feeds the world? My answer is very different to that given by 
      most people.
      It is women and small farmers working with biodiversity who are the 
      primary food providers in the Third World, and contrary to the 
      dominant assumption, their biodiversity based small farms are more 
      productive than industrial monocultures.
      The rich diversity and sustainable systems of food production are 
      being destroyed in the name of increasing food production. However, 
      with the destruction of diversity, rich sources of nutrition 
      disappear. When measured in terms of nutrition per acre, and from the 
      perspective biodiversity, the so called "high yields" of industrial 
      agriculture or industrial fisheries do not imply more production of 
      food and nutrition.
      Yields usually refers to production per unit area of a single crop. 
      Output refers to the total production of diverse crops and products. 
      Planting only one crop in the entire field as a monoculture will of 
      course increase its individual yield. Planting multiple crops in a 
      mixture will have low yields of individual crops, but will have high 
      total output of food. Yields have been defined in such a way as to 
      make the food production on small farms by small farmers disappear. 
      This hides the production by millions of women farmers in the Third 
      World - farmers like those in my native Himalaya who fought against 
      logging in the Chipko movement, who in their terraced fields even 
      today grow Jhangora (barnyard millet), Marsha (Amaranth), Tur (Pigeon 
      Pea), Urad (Black gram), Gahat (horse gram), Soya Bean (Glycine Max), 
      Bhat (Glycine Soya) - endless diversity in their fields. From the 
      biodiversity perspective, biodiversity based productivity is higher 
      than monoculture productivity. I call this blindness to the high 
      productivity of diversity a "Monoculture of the Mind", which creates 
      monocultures in our fields and in our world.
      The Mayan peasants in the Chiapas are characterised as unproductive 
      because they produce only 2 tons of corn per acre. However, the 
      overall food output is 20 tons per acre when the diversity of their 
      beans and squashes, their vegetables their fruit trees are taken into 
      account.
      In Java, small farmers cultivate 607 species in their home gardens. 
      In sub-Saharan Africa, women cultivate 120 different plants. A single 
      home garden in Thailand has 230 species, and African home gardens 
      have more than 60 species of trees.
      Rural families in the Congo eat leaves from more than 50 species of 
      their farm trees.
      A study in eastern Nigeria found that home gardens occupying only 2 
      per cent of a household's farmland accounted for half of the farm's 
      total output. In Indonesia 20 per cent of household income and 40 per 
      cent of domestic food supplies come from the home gardens managed by 
      women.
      Research done by FAO has shown that small biodiverse farms can 
      produce thousands of times more food than large, industrial 
      monocultures.
      And diversity in addition to giving more food is the best strategy 
      for preventing drought and desertification.
      What the world needs to feed a growing population sustainably is 
      biodiversity intensification, not the chemical intensification or the 
      intensification of genetic engineering. While women and small 
      peasants feed the world through biodiversity we are repeatedly told 
      that without genetic engineering and globalisation of agriculture the 
      world will starve. In spite of all empirical evidence showing that 
      genetic engineering does not produce more food and in fact often 
      leads to a yield decline, it is constantly promoted as the only 
      alternative available for feeding the hungry.
      That is why I ask, who feeds the world?
      This deliberate blindness to diversity, the blindness to nature's 
      production, production by women, production by Third World farmers 
      allows destruction and appropriation to be projected as creation.
      Take the case of the much flouted "golden rice" or genetically 
      engineered Vitamin A rice as a cure for blindness. It is assumed that 
      without genetic engineering we cannot remove Vitamin A deficiency. 
      However, nature gives us abundant and diverse sources of vitamin A. 
      If rice was not polished, rice itself would provide Vitamin A. If 
      herbicides were not sprayed on our wheat fields, we would have 
      bathua, amaranth, mustard leaves as delicious and nutritious greens 
      that provide Vitamin A.
      Women in Bengal use more than 150 plants as greens - Hinche sak 
      (Enhydra fluctuans), Palang sak (Spinacea oleracea), Tak palang 
      (Rumex vesicarious), Lal Sak (Amaranthus gangeticus) - to name but a 
      few.
      But the myth of creation presents biotechnologists as the creators of 
      Vitamin A, negating nature's diverse gifts and women's knowledge of 
      how to use this diversity to feed their children and families.
      The most efficient means of rendering the destruction of nature, 
      local economies and small autonomous producers is by rendering their 
      production invisible.
      Women who produce for their families and communities are treated as 
      `non-productive' and `economically' inactive. The devaluation of 
      women's work, and of work done in sustainable economies, is the 
      natural outcome of a system constructed by capitalist patriarchy. 
      This is how globalisation destroys local economies and destruction 
      itself is counted as growth.
      <snip The globalisation of non-sustainable industrial agriculture is 
      literally evaporating the incomes of Third World farmers through a 
      combination of devaluation of currencies, increase in costs of 
      production and a collapse in commodity prices.
      Farmers everywhere are being paid a fraction of what they received 
      for the same commodity a decade ago. The Canadian National Farmers 
      Union put it like this in a report to the senate this year:
      "While the farmers growing cereal grains - wheat, oats, corn - earn 
      negative returns and are pushed close to bankruptcy, the companies 
      that make breakfast cereals reap huge profits. In 1998, cereal 
      companies Kellogg's, Quaker Oats, and General Mills enjoyed return on 
      equity rates of 56%, 165% and 222% respectively. While a bushel of 
      corn sold for less than $4, a bushel of corn flakes sold for $133 ... 
      Maybe farmers are making too little because others are taking too 
      much."
      And a World Bank report has admitted that "behind the polarisation of 
      domestic consumer prices and world prices is the presence of large 
      tradingcompanies in international commodity markets."
      While farmers earn less, consumers pay more. In India, food prices 
      have doubled between 1999 and 2000. The consumption of food grains in 
      rural areas has dropped by 12%. Increased economic growth through 
      global commerce is based on pseudo surpluses. More food is being 
      traded while thepoor are consuming less. When growth increases 
      poverty, when real production becomes a negative economy, and 
      speculators are defined as "wealth creators", something has gone 
      wrong with the concepts and categories of wealth and wealth creation. 
      Pushing the real production by nature and people into a negative 
      economy implies that production of real goods and services is 
      declining, creating deeper poverty for the millions who are not part 
      of the dot.com route to instant wealth creation.
      Women - as I have said - are the primary food producers and food 
      processors in the world. However, their work in production and 
      processing is now becoming invisible.
      Recently, the McKinsey corporation said: "American food giants 
      recognise that Indian agro-business has lots of room to grow, 
      especially in food processing. India processes a minuscule 1 per cent 
      of the food it grows compared with 70 per cent for the U.S...".
      It is not that we Indians eat our food raw. Global consultants fail 
      to see the 99 per cent food processing done by women at household 
      level, or by the small cottage industry because it is not controlled 
      by global agribusiness. 99% of India's agroprocessing has been 
      intentionally kept atthe small level. Now , under the pressure of 
      globalisation, things are changing. Pseudo hygiene laws are being 
      uses to shut down local economies and small scale processing.
      In August 1998, small scale local processing of edible oil was banned 
      in India through a "packaging order" which made sale of open oil 
      illegal and required all oil to be packaged in plastic or aluminium. 
      This shut down tiny "ghanis" or cold pressed mills. It destroyed the 
      market for our diverse oilseeds - mustard, linseed, sesame, 
      groundnut, coconut.
      And the take-over of the edible oil industry has affected 10 million 
      livelihoods. The take over of flour or "atta" by packaged branded 
      flour will cost 100 million livelihoods. And these millions are being 
      pushed into new poverty.
      The forced use of packaging will increase the environmental burden of 
      millions of tonnes of waste.
      The globalisation of the food system is destroying the diversity of 
      local food cultures and local food economies. A global monoculture is 
      being forced on people by defining everything that is fresh, local 
      and handmade as a health hazard. Human hands are being defined as the 
      worst contaminants, and work for human hands is being outlawed, to be 
      replaced by machines and chemicals bought from global corporations. 
      These are not recipes for feeding the world, but stealing livelihoods 
      from the poor to create markets for the powerful.
      People are being perceived as parasites, to be exterminated for 
      the "health" of the global economy.
      In the process new health and ecological hazards are being forced on 
      Third World people through dumping of genetically engineered foods 
      and other hazardous products.
      Recently, because of a W.T.O. ruling, India has been forced to remove 
      restrictions on all imports.
      ** Among the unrestricted imports are carcasses and animal waste 
      parts that create a threat to our culture and introduce public health 
      hazards such asthe Mad Cow Disease.**
      The US Centre for Disease Prevention in Atlanta has calculated that 
      nearly81 million cases of food borne illnesses occur in the US every 
      year. Deaths from food poisoning have gone up more up more than four 
      times due to deregulation. Most of these infections are caused by 
      factory farmed meat. The US slaughters 93 million pigs, thirty seven 
      million cattle, two million calves, six million horses, goats and 
      sheep and eight billion chickens and turkeys each year.
      Now the giant meat industry of US wants to dump contaminated meat 
      producedthrough violent and cruel methods on Indian consumers.
      The waste of the rich is being dumped on the poor. The wealth of the 
      poor is being violently appropriated through new and clever means 
      like patents on biodiversity and indigenous knowledge.
      <snip As humans travel further down the road to non-sustainability, 
      they become intolerant of other species and blind to their vital role 
      in our survival.
      In 1992, when Indian farmers destroyed Cargill's seed plant in 
      Bellary, Karnataka, to protest against seed failure, the Cargill 
      Chief Executive stated, "We bring Indian farmers smart technologies 
      which prevent bees from usurping the pollen". When I was 
      participating in the United Nations Biosafety Negotiations, Monsanto 
      circulated literature to defend its herbicide resistant Roundup ready 
      crops on grounds that they prevent "weeds from stealing the 
      sunshine". But what Monsanto calls weeds are the green fields that 
      provide Vitamin A rice and prevent blindness in childrenand anaemia 
      in women.
      A worldview that defines pollination as "theft by bees" and claims 
      biodiversity "steals" sunshine is a worldview which itself aims at 
      stealing nature's harvest by replacing open, pollinated varieties 
      with hybrids and sterile seeds, and destroying biodiverse flora with 
      herbicidessuch as Roundup. The threat posed to the Monarch butterfly 
      by genetically engineered bt crops is just one example of the 
      ecological poverty created by the new biotechnologies. As butterflies 
      and bees disappear, production is undermined. As biodiversity 
      disappears, with it go sources of nutrition and food.
      <snip The world can be fed only by feeding all beings that make the 
      world.
      In giving food to other beings and species we maintain conditions for 
      our own food security. In feeding earthworms we feed ourselves. In 
      feeding cows, we feed the soil, and in providing food for the soil, 
      we provide food for humans. This worldview of abundance is based on 
      sharing and on a deep awareness of humans as members of the earth 
      family. This awareness that in impoverishing other beings, we 
      impoverish ourselves and in nourishing other beings, we nourish 
      ourselves is the real basis of sustainability.
      The sustainability challenge for the new millennium is whether global 
      economic man can move out of the worldview based on fear and 
      scarcity, monocultures and monopolies, appropriation and 
      dispossession and shift to a view based on abundance and sharing, 
      diversity and decentralisation, andrespect and dignity for all beings.
      Sustainability demands that we move out of the economic trap that is 
      leaving no space for other species and other people. Economic 
      Globalisation has become a war against nature and the poor. But the 
      rules of globalisation are not god - given. They can be changed. They 
      must be changed. We must bring this war to an end.
      <snip As Gandhi had reminded us: "The earth has enough for everyone's 
      needs, but not for some people's greed".
      QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
      **Sujata Gupta, the Tata Energy Research Institute:         I'd like 
      to hear your views on sustainable use of scarce inputs like water for 
      agriculture. What I gathered from your lecture was total condemnation 
      of the market system.  Vandana Shiva:         Let me first respond by 
      saying - I love markets. I love my local market where local "subgees" 
      are sold, and one can chat with the women. The tragedy really is that 
      the market is being turned into the only organising principle for 
      life, and Wall St is being turned into the only source of value, and 
      it's the disappearance of other markets, other valuesthat I am 
      condemning. In terms of water, the solution to water conservation and 
      scarce water management is not putting it in the hands ofthose who 
      can afford to buy the last drop, but to put it in the hands of the 
      community, to use it sustainably within the limits of renewal. The 
      water must be returned to the communities and managed as a commons - 
      it has to be taken beyond the marketplace.
      **Professor Marva, University of Delhi:         Can there be 
      sustainable development without sustainable population?  Vandana 
      Shiva:         I think non-sustainable population growth is a symptom 
      and productof non-sustainable development. It's not that population 
      grows by itself as a separate phenomena - you look at the data - 
      Indian population had stability till 1800 - colonisation, 
      dispossession of land started to make our population grow. Highest 
      growth rates of population in England is after the enclosures of the 
      commons. It's the loss of resources of the people that generate 
      livelihood and the replacement of resources by labourto be sold on 
      markets in an uncertain daily wage market that triggers population 
      growth. Population growth is a result of non-sustainable development.
      <snip Gulgit Choudhury, Ram Organics:         I have worked earlier 
      with Monsanto. I have a simple question to ask you. Suppose you were 
      given the opportunity to develop parameters of a social governance 
      which ensures sustainability - what would you suggest for countries 
      like India.?  Vandana Shiva:         We are in fact involved for the 
      last few years - generating the kind of criteria through 
      participatory democracy building - through ensuring that people at 
      every level have the information, through ensuringthat communities 
      are organised, to manage collectively the resources that can only be 
      sustained collectively. If I have the money and power to drilla deep 
      tube well I can make dry my neighbour's shallow well and she will 
      usually be a very poor woman. And therefore the only way a village 
      can conserve its ground water is to do what the "Paani Panchayath" 
      did in Harash - ensure that water is used within limits. Systems of 
      governance have to begin with where people feel the impact, and 
      therefore we do require the rebuilding of decentralised direct 
      democracy. I do not see growers as isolated individuals because the 
      consequences of their action are felt by their neighbours. If I am 
      growing b.t. corn on my field I killthe monarch butterfly of my 
      neighbour's field. Communities, collectives are cohesiveness of 
      societies are important to talk about not individual growers, and 
      that is the bottom rung of decision making to which both which 
      corporations as well as governments need to be accountable - that 
      isthe experiment that started after Seattle and that experiment in 
      accountable localisation to ensure that decisions are made at 
      appropriate place and production is carried out at the appropriate 
      level is really thenew enterprise of democracy that societies are 
      involved in around the world, even while globalisation threatens our 
      lives.
      <snip **Finally, we had this from last year's Reith lecturer Anthony 
      Giddens - addressing you Vandana he says -         "I congratulate 
      you on your challenging presentation. I have to say though I don't 
      agree with much of it. Isn't it a contradiction in terms to use the 
      global media to put a case against globalisation?"
      Vandana Shiva:         I don't think BBC is a product of the economic 
      globalisation regime that the World Trade Organisation gave us or the 
      new recent trade liberalisation has given us. I think it was created 
      in l922 and international integration, international communication is 
      not what economic globalisation is about. Corporate concentration, 
      corporate control is what recent economic globalisation is about and 
      in fact the BBCis a counter-example to that because the real example 
      of globalised media and communication is Time Warner, now bought up 
      by American on Line, Disney, and the News Corporation.
      **Prof. Vinod Chowdhury, reader in economics at St. Stephen's 
      College:         It strikes me as very extraordinary that Vandanaji 
      should have such a one sided approach. And I'm saying that with due 
      respect to the sheer vivacity of her presentation. Vandanaji seems to 
      believe that there are two clearly antithetical paradigms. One is a 
      paradigm that essentiallyis based on decentralisation, 
      democratisation - all the good things in life - - women are cared 
      for, poor people are cared for - this, that and the other. And other 
      is terribly evil. Everything's wrong with it. Now surely life cannot 
      be like that Vandanaji may I plead with you to please consider third 
      paradigm, where we take bits and pieces from here and thereand get an 
      eclectic, practical approach, and I support Boopinder Singh Hooda - 
      the President of the Haryama Congress who asked you - and you didn't 
      answer that - what is the alternative at a time when no country 
      canopt out of the WTO - it's not a piece of paper madam - it is a 
      commitment that countries have to make or they will be paraiah 
      countries and we cannot afford to be a paraiah country - please 
      react?  Vandana Shiva:         I did react to him. And I said 
      rewriting those rules - rewriting those rules that are one sided. In 
      fact it's the WTO rules that are totally one sided because they 
      really only protect the interest of one sector of the global 
      community which is the global corporations, not in the local 
      industry, not even local retail business, not small farmers anywhere, 
      not in the north and not in the south. And those rules can be 
      rewritten. That is the point I'm trying to make. Do not treat WTO 
      rules inthe Uruguay Round Treaty as the final word on how trade 
      should be carried out. Those rules are being reviewed. What we have 
      called for in Seattle isa more democratic input in what sustainable 
      and just rules would look likefor agriculture on intellectual 
      property rights, in the area of services, in the area of investments, 
      the four new areas which were brought in. Before that - no-one had 
      problems with the GATT. The old GATT was about real trade in real 
      products beyond national boundaries. The new GATT with the Uruguay 
      round - is about invading in every space of our everyday lives... and 
      if you are a woman you do have a somewhat different point of view. 
      That's why we talk of gender. If you are poor, you will have a 
      different point of view from the rich. To have different points of 
      view because of differences in location in society is not a problem. 
      It is opportunistic though to take a little element of the 
      perspective of the rich , a little element of the perspective of the 
      poor and put it into a little jigsaw of opportunistic statements. 
      Societies live by coherent principles, organisational systems, values 
      and world views. And what we are calling for is to balance out that 
      one sided idea that we live by commerce alone.
      **Rovinder Raki, student:         You seem to eulogise the fairness 
      and efficiency of traditional agricultures, societies and production 
      patterns. But the reality is that the farmers were exploited in these 
      societies by moneylenders and feudal lords. With the market reaching 
      these societies that exploitative social system certainly declines. 
      Now what I have to ask you is what restrains you from appreciating 
      this sanitising effect of the market?  Vandana Shiva:         Well 
      the sanitising affect of the market does end up treating people like 
      germs. Wipe them out. And it is that view of dispensability, the 
      disappearances of the small that I was trying to draw attention to in 
      my lecture. There has always been exploitation, and I agree with Mr 
      Hooda, but no exploitation before this period of current, economic 
      globalisation, ever organised itself in ways that it could totally 
      dispense with the exploited. Even the slave system needed the slave. 
      Even the worst of British rule which created the Bengal famine, and 
      led to the "Faybehaga" movement to rise against the exploitation, it 
      needed to keep the peasants alive For the first time we have a system 
      where no-one needs the peasants,unless we realise as societies we 
      need them, that we've reached a period where people are actually 
      talking in India, in other countries that you can get rid of small 
      producers. It's assumed that everything, real growth,real prosperity 
      is going to come out of cyber space, but as you can see, you can have 
      the best of IT technologies floating above the carcasses of people 
      dying in Rajisthan and Gujerat right now -- and it will not help them 
      out. We have to pay attention to the ecological base of our survival 
      and the needs of all. I personally am committed to feeling and 
      believing that the smallest of species and the smallest of people 
      have as much a right to live on this planet with dignity as the most 
      powerful corporation and the most powerful individual.

  Below this report from Dr Gabe Mirkin is the abstract
  of the study Mirkin cites on the possibility of a link
  between Alzheimer's disease and zinc, which is followed
  by the abstract of a recent study (2000) on this topic:

http://www.drmirkin.com/archive/6325.html

ZINC CAUSES ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?

Report #6325 9/6/94

More than 20 years ago, scientists reported a link between
aluminum and Alzheimer's disease, a condition that causes
senility. Now, most serious scientists do not consider
aluminum a factor, but a recent report in the journal,
Science, shows that another mineral, zinc, may be associated
with that disease.

Scientists have known for years that an abnormal protein
called beta amyloid accumulates in the brains of people with
Alzheimer's disease. Previously, scientists thought that it
takes years for beta amyloid to form, but Dr. Rudolph Tanzi
of the Massachusetts General Hospital was able to form beta
amyloid a couple of minutes after adding high doses of zinc
to brain tissue. Brain tissue normally contains very small
amounts of zinc.

You certainly should not try to avoid foods that are rich
sources of zinc, such as meat, liver, eggs, and seafood.
Lack of zinc can cause loss of taste and smell, decreased
ability to fight infections and loss of memory. However, it
may be prudent to avoid zinc pills. In 1991, a study from
the University of Melbourne in Australia was discontinued
after only two days because giving zinc supplements to
subjects with Alzheimer's disease caused a rapid
deterioration of their mental abilities. In 1980, another
study showed that taking large doses of zinc lower blood
levels of the good HDL cholesterol that prevents heart attacks.

I'm Dr. Gabe Mirkin on Fitness.

Rapid induction of Alzheimer A beta amyloid formation by zinc.

A beta 1-40, a major component of Alzheimer's disease cerebral
amyloid, is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and remains
relatively soluble at high concentrations (less than or equal
to 3.7 mM). Thus, physiological factors which induce A beta
amyloid formation could provide clues to the pathogenesis of
the disease. It has been shown that human A beta specifically
and saturably binds zinc. Here, concentrations of zinc above
300 nM rapidly destabilized human A beta 1-40 solutions,
inducing tinctorial amyloid formation. However, rat A beta
1-40 binds zinc less avidly and is immune to these effects,
perhaps explaining the scarcity with which these animals form
cerebral A beta amyloid. These data suggest a role for cerebral
zinc metabolism in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid deposits
within the neocortical parenchyma and the cerebrovasculature.
The main component of these predominantly extracellular
collections, Abeta, which is normally a soluble component of
all biological fluids, is cleaved out of a ubiquitously
expressed parent protein, the amyloid protein precursor (APP),
one of the type 1 integral membrane glycoproteins. Considerable
evidence has indicated that there is zinc dyshomeostasis and
abnormal cellular zinc mobilization in AD. We have characterized
both APP and Abeta as copper/zinc metalloproteins. Zinc, copper
and iron have recently been reported to be concentrated to 0.5
to 1 mmol/L in amyloid plaque. In vitro, rapid Abeta aggregation
is mediated by Zn(II), promoted by the alpha-helical structure
of Abeta, and is reversible with chelation. In addition, Abeta
produces hydrogen peroxide in a Cu(II)/Fe(III)-dependent manner,
and the hydrogen peroxide formation is quenched by Zn(II).
Moreover, zinc preserves the nontoxic properties of Abeta.
Although the zinc-binding proteins apolipoprotein E epsilon4
allele and alpha(2)-macroglobulin have been characterized as
two genetic risk factors for AD, zinc exposure as a risk factor
for AD has not been rigorously studied. Based on our findings,
we envisage that zinc may serve twin roles by both initiating
amyloid deposition and then being involved in mechanisms
attempting to quench oxidative stress and neurotoxicity derived
from the amyloid mass. Hence, it remains debatable whether zinc
supplementation is beneficial or deleterious for AD until
additional studies clarify the issue.

   FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF "GOOD SHOT" ON WACO SWAT TAPE

   (c) 8/28/00 Ian Williams Goddard

   On August 4th I posted an audio file from a videotape
   made by a member of the FBI SWAT team at a sniper nest
   outside Mount Carmel in Waco on the day that Mt Carmel
   burned down (http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm).
   The cameraman is a couple hundred yards from Mt Carmel.
   On the tape, as you watch Mt Carmel burn a gunshot sound
   is heard followed by voices near the camera that appear
   to say "Good shot?" followed by "A good shot!" This may
   be a snipper asking his spotter if his shot hit a target
   followed by the spotter confirming it was "a good shot."

   After I posted that audio I contacted Mark Swett. [1]
   Swett is one of the people who transcribed audio tapes
   from bugs planted inside Mt Carmel. His transcriptions
   suggest that the Davidians started the fire. About the
   "good shot" audio track, Mark reported the following:

     "I picked up five shots. The beginning of the
     audio has what may be a shot that I include in
     the five - most in the distance, but one towards
     the end is closer to the video mic. The dialogue
     sounds like 'good shot' followed by 'good try.'"

   The straightforward interpretation of men near the
   camera saying "Good shot ... Good try" is basically
   the same as their saying "Good shot? ... A good shot!"
   with the exception that in the first case the shot was
   a miss. Both interpretations suggest a scene where men
   are shooting at targets and commenting on the accuracy
   of the shots. About another audio clip from the same
   SWAT-team tape, [2] Mark Swett offered this analysis:

     "I picked up six shots. The dialogue sounds
     like 'Bullseye' twice followed by 'ha-ha-ha.'
     The last portion is heard as 'good hit.'"

   Having found possible evidence of Davidian culpability in
   his analysis of the Mt Carmel audio tapes, nobody could
   rightfully suggest Swett hears what he wants to hear due
   to an anti-government bias, and the easiest explanation
   for what he and others of us hear is that the voices are
   some men a couple hundred yards from Mt Carmel shooting
   at targets and commenting on the accuracy of the shots.
   Moreover, if Swett's hearing of gunshots further and
   closer is accurate, a possible interpretation is that
   not all shots heard can be attributed to coming from one
   location, such as Mt Carmel, and thus they may be either
   a long-range gunfight or shots from several sniper nests.


   OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF SWAT-TAPE AUDIO

   While the majority of respondents agree that they hear
   "Good shot," someone suggested that the two statements
   are "I been shot" followed by "I've been shot." The
   second statement can sound like that if you listen with
   that in mind. However, after using the "noise reduction"
   function in the Goldwave.com program, [3] I could not
   be more sure that it's: "Good shot? ... A good shot!"

   A big problem with the "I been shot" interpretation
   is explaining why anyone would say that. If it was an
   agent joking around after hearing a Davidian gunshot,
   there is no joking quality to the voice. If it was a
   person actually being shot, there are no sounds that
   follow the alleged "I been shot" statements that would
   corroborate the hypothesis that someone was shot. One
   might expect to hear agonizing moans or cursing if in
   fact the speaker had been shot. Instead there is no
   further talking for some time (except as a voice breaks
   in over a police-type radio), and when the voices in
   the background return, the atmosphere is casual and
   you even hear people laughing. Nobody got shot there.

   Other suggested interpretations are "Got a shot" or
   "Gun shot" instead of "Good shot." Let me know what
   you hear: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav
   Same file with Goldwave.com "noise reduction" applied:
   http://egroups.com/files/WacoInvestigations/goodshot4.wav


   HEAR AND SEE THIS WACO EVIDENCE FOR YOURSELF

   I recently acquired a second VCR so I could fulfill
   several requests for copies of the SWAT-team tape and
   the Waco FLIR. If you are interested in copies of the
   Waco SWAT-Team video or the Waco FLIR, I can send you
   a copy, all I ask is 7 dollars per tape (check or m.o.
   to Ian Goddard, PO Box 10235, Rockville, MD 20849-0235)
   to cover all costs. Each tape is approximately an hour.
   My master copy of the Waco FLIR is a copy of Davidian
   attorney James Brannon's copy and the visual clarity
   is superior to that seen in any of the popular Waco
   documentaries. The FLIR covers everything that was
   analyzed by Carols Ghigliotti and Dr Edward Allard.
   Unfortunately the SWAT-Team tape is of a poor visual
   quality and much of it is meaningless footage of cattle
   and the countryside around Mt Carmel. The cameraman then
   does a tour of the sniper nests on the last day. As Linda
   Thompson, who initially acquired the tape, says, there's
   a lot of surprising intelligence on the SWAT-Team tape.
   The audio files on-line sound as good as on the tape.

 This is virtually indistinguishable from an existing sport. There is a
race where people run from Badwater (in Death Valley) to Whitney Portal
(which appears to be nearly 150 km by road). I know someone who plans to
run this race next July (he hopes to make it in 40 hours, which precludes
sleeping), and then climb Mt. Whitney. It's sufficiently similar to races
he has run in the past that I won't be surprised if he finishes as he expects.
It isn't clear that your 5 minute rule would have much effect on his strategy.
Rules about contestants carrying their own water presumably affect the
maximum distance people can manage, but I wouldn't expect them to have
major effects on the character of the race.

 For a truly new (and not yet feasible) class of sports, I suggest ones
where contestants can't learn from direct experience, but instead need
to learn by observing copies of themselves. My inspiration(?) for this
class of sports comes from Monty Python's "Being Eaten by a Crocodile"
competition (which should provide a hint about how serious it is), but
I haven't been able to work out details that would make it a good test
of skill.

Hey guys/gals, guess what I found this weekend at an antique shop around the
corner? A Commodore VIC-20, no kidding. Bout a dozen games, and oh my god, a
whole 8K memory expansion card. I may put on the shelf next to my fossilized
dino-turd, though maybe I'll fire it up. It came with the original manual and
tape drive...  Maybe I'll put it on ebay...

Ah, yes, like the old Vogon favorite, "Toss a hitcher out into space"
competition.

All current forms of competition typically rate by one or more of the following
criteria:

time
distance
height
quantity
speed
style
accuracy
smarts/stupidity
memory
beauty/ugliness
strength
dexterity
smelliness
brutality
anything else???

Coming up with a new sport would obviously require combining criteria that have
not in the past been combined, in environments not encountered, with equipment
not yet devised.

Now, things like the slalom boogieboarding through an alligator infested squamp
(in an evening gown) might be interesting.

Thank you for the correction. Is an AT, GC sequence a DNA profile?

I've been following the thread and was pleased when James Rogers

the sands of a dormant volcano, the Navajo Indian Reservation,

diverse treks that have given me the greatest satisfaction.

A new sport that excites me (in this body and at this time)is
a meta-athlon (metathlon) of diverse terrain by multifaceted,

sailing, swimming, surfing, rollerblading, scatbording, parachuting,
flying, and virtually simulated performance.

Several years ago I designed a concept VR Fitness device to allow real exercise
in many different VR environments. Of course, it would have been frightfully
expensive.

Other sports I'd go for:
human powered submarine races
stratospheric ramjet hangliding
solar sail racing
Jovian Chicken (who can go deeper before boosting out).
bicycle powered ion drive races.... ;)

Well, the "et al." lets this list be never ending.:)

While stationed at Ashiya AB, Japan, 1956 - 1959, I took several of the base
Special Services trips around Japan, mostly by train to sight-see many
different things. One of them was the pen feeding operation in Kobe, Japan,
where the famous steaks originated. The pens were extremely small, one
animal per pen, and the cattle were fed a ground up mixture of many
different types of food. Once the animal grew to a certain size, it was
placed in a sling so that it's feet barely touched the ground and it was
force fed several times a day and massaged with Sake and/or beer. The object
of the alcoholic rubdowns was to calm the frustrated animal, which was
highly stressed after being placed in the sling. When it came time for
slaughter they injected Papaya juice into the animals veins so that it would
go throughout the entire animal and help in softening and marinating the
flesh. The Japanese didn't have the space nor facilities to breed and raise
beef in that country, so most of the cattle came from Australia, New
Zealand, and the U.S., when they were very young. I never had a steak
anywhere near as good as an original Kobe steak.

Al Brashear:
It is my understanding, from roaming the Orient since 1960, and listening to
the locals, that Kobe beef refers to the city/area in which the process was
started long ago, and to the way the cattle are treated. The cattle are
imported from lots of places, Washington State for one.

The cattle are not allowed to move around too much, fattened up on whatever
the Japanese feed them, and supposedly massaged frequently with, of all
things, beer.

Never saw the process. Never cared to since I enjoyed the Kobe style of
steaks.

But they'd be damned hot to wear, in turn, I think.

A data point: evaporating/venting one gram of water takes off 2.4
kilojoules of heat. I don't know how that would compare with slowly raising
the temperature of a capillary mesh of liquid helium (4.2 degrees K) or
whatever.

Folks, I've been as frustrated by certain of the science media's
pseudoanalysis of nanotech theory as anyone. At the same time however,
without sugar-coating any erroneous anti-nanotech arguments, it's worth
noting that some of the opposition to Drexler was probably pretty honest
in intent originally, even when mistaken. For instance, _Nano_, Ed
Regis' book on the subject, is seemingly quite accurate in depicting
the heady atmosphere generated by Drexler's ideas back in the 1980's.
Generally, it would be rare for scientists such as Drexler and company
to see themselves as in charge of quite such an  earth-shaking
revolution -- and of course this was going to generate some kind of
determinedly "rare" sorts of opposing views. Even relatively recently,
such a far-out scientific visionary as Freeman Dyson can say that he is
in some way "skeptical" of Drexler. So if Mr. "Astro-Chickens will
explore the solar system" Dyson can express general skepticism, we can
only imagine what what the regular, staid, back-of-the-laboratory
science worker must think!

Anyway, as far as the United States NNI program outline document is
concerned, it is not so surprising that the initiators of the key ideas
would not be mentioned in the document. Historical analogy: if extremely
high-level government committees had been in charge of checking
Einstein's theories, would the directives have even mentioned Einstein,
or just some of the people who might be sent on eclipse viewing
expeditions? More to the point, if someone started handing out lifetime
acheivement awards, and they ostentatiously missed Drexler, that *would*
be something remiss -- but beaurocratic program outlines aren't really
about that, right?

Say, *here* is a nice media report on nanotech, in RealAudio format,
from the Dec 11, 1999 edition of the Canadian weekly science show
"Quirks and Quarks". It's at
http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/quirks/archives.htm. If I recall right,
the report is near the beginning of this 50 minute long science program,
so you should be able to click right on it and hear the nanotech
comments of Richard Smalley and Nadrian Seeman right away -- though
Drexler wasn't in this report, and neither, I think, were Merkle nor
Freitas, "sigh" :^) .

1.  I don't think Drexler "lost."  OK, so he isn't mentioned in the NNI 
paper.  So what?  I'm sure that everyone who *is* mentioned knows that 
Drexler is the leading visionary in the field.

2.  That fact that Drexler & Co. are not formally recognized by the 
governmental effort, I think, attests more to the radical uses Drexler sees 
for strong nanotech than the transparency he advocates.  Absolutely *no one* 
who needs the vote of middle America to keep his job is going to push a 
national nano initiative and at the same time give official recognition to a 
guy who says that nano will be used for things like giving people indefinite 
lifespan and unlimited wealth.  It sounds just a little to far out for mere 
entropians to grasp.  Not to mention the fact if you give recognition to 
Drexler’s contributions you will inevitably have to confront his writings on 
the “gray goo” problem.  That’s definitely *not* something you want 
associated with your nano initiative if you are a politician.

Bottom line, if Drexler was in it to have a positive impact on the 
development of nano he has done, and is doing, that.  On the other hand, if 
he was in it just to be recognized by Joe Q. Public as the ground-breaking 
pioneer in the field, OK, perhaps he lost.  But if that was his motivation, 
I’m glad he lost.

Interestingly, this is precisely what Alan Turing suspected. If you read his
original paper proposing the "Turing test" for determining whether an AI has
human-equivalent intelligence, you will see that Turing believed that ESP
could be a significant factor. It's quite curious that this fact has been
conveniently forgotten by so many of Turing's intellectual heirs.

Below is the relevant section from Turing's paper "The Imitation Game" in
COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE.
(http://www.abelard.org/turpap/turpap.htm)

(9) The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception  I assume that the reader is
familiar with the idea of extra-sensory perception, and the meaning of the
four items of it, viz. telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
psycho-kinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual
scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the
statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very
difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in. Once one
has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts and
bogies. The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of
physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar,
would be one of the first to go.
This argument is to my mind quite a strong one. One can say in reply that
many scientific theories seem to remain workable in practice, in spite of
clashing with E.S.P.; that in fact one can get along very nicely if one
forgets about it. This is rather cold comfort, and one fears that thinking
is just the kind of phenomenon where E.S.P. may be especially relevant.
A more specific argument based on E.S.P. might run as follows:
"Let us play the imitation game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a
telepathic receiver, and a digital computer. The interrogator can ask such
questions as 'What suit does the card in my right hand belong to?' The man
by telepathy or clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times out of 400
cards. The machine can only guess at random, and perhaps gets 104 right, so
the interrogator makes the right identification." There is an interesting
possibility which opens here. Suppose the digital computer contains a random
number generator. Then it will be natural to use this to decide what answer
to give. But then the random number generator will be subject to the
psycho-kinetic powers of the interrogator. Perhaps this psycho-kinesis might
cause the machine to guess right more often than would be expected on a
probability calculation, so that the interrogator {p.454} might still be
unable to make the right identification. On the other hand, he might be able
to guess right without any questioning, by clairvoyance. With E.S.P.
anything may happen.
If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up. The
situation could be regarded as analogous to that which would occur if the
interrogator were talking to himself and one of the competitors was
listening with his ear to the wall. To put the competitors into a
'telepathy-proof room' would satisfy all requirements."

Your argument might have merit if they'd managed to also steal Drexler's ideas
about the massive impact of nanotech and the need for safe development.

Ja, a competitor in the Badwater to Portals is a friend and former
neighbor, Gil Cornell.  They made a huge deal of his competing and
(I believe) winning that race when he was a grandfather.  Nowthen,
it was a bit misleading to suggest a wisened old man winning
an ultramarathon, for tho he was technically a grandfather, he got there
by getting in trouble in high school, then his son grew up and did
likewise, so Gil was only 34 when his granddaughter was born. I
can assure you, he was very much at the top of his game.

My comment to Gil was that golf and ultramarathon are among
the few sports that will not be totally dominated by children, since
much of the competition in ultramarathon is mental discipline, which
the teenagers have yet to develop generally (this was before Tiger
Woods).

Gil added that ultramarathon is one of the very few sports where
men and women may compete more or less equally, and further
speculated that in a much longer race women may have the advantage
over men with their legendary greater pain threshold, etc.  This has
been shown in the recent Eco-challenge.  Comments?

> Rules about contestants carrying their own water presumably affect the

My notion of carrying everything puts greater emphasis on strategy and
less on who is the strongest.  Of course the one in the best condition
still has a big advantage, but a desk jockey who does everything exactly
right could still make a respectable showing.  It also emphasizes choosing
the right equipment, which will change depending on the conditions.

Nowthen, I have in mind designing this sport so that CRers would
have a shot.  Generally CRers have small muscles, which takes them
out of the hunt for almost any competition except long running or
walking contests.  Having the event in Death Valley favors the boney,
for with leanness comes great efficiency of the body's own
cooling system.  A very thin person can reject sufficient heat thru
the lungs alone to obviate much sweating thru the skin.  If you are curious,
go to Death Valley in late September and see how it feels when
it is about 100 degrees F and nearly zero humidity.  Its comfortable!
Lungs are great cooling devices.

Lastly, I want a competition that allows a shot by those of us who
labor away our lives making micro-changes in the magnetic domains
on a spinning metallic disc in a climate controlled office.  This would
include most of us here.  The distance walk with no stopping, no caches and
no jettisoning of anything you started with has all these elements.  Ive
already started choosing my equipment.  spike

When I used to race bicycles, I couldn't come close to keeping up with the
men in short races over flat ground.  But in long road races through hilly
terrain, I could beat many of the men due to my lighter weight and greater
endurance. It wasn't that I bore pain cheerfully, though.  I hate pain.  I
could just keep going all day with no pain.

Actually Ian

It is pretty annoying to read this Waco stuff all the time. I understand the
local interrest for it, but Extropians is an international list, and I
personally don't care about the Waco shooting all the way over here in
Denmark.

Besides I find that it is rather of topic.

Kind regards Max M

The reason I question his inclusion was because I doubt he is a "total man"
and I also question whether he is an "enlightened master."  What, in
particular, makes you think he is?

Agreed, though that's also true of lots of human-made drugs and other
supplements.

The problem: so many substances, so little time and so little money.

I'd like to see better methods of studying the problem.  Elsewhere I
suggestion using genetic algorithmns to search the space of potential
cryoprotectants.  Perhaps a similar tack could be used searching the space
of potential life extension chemicals, though that's probably too broad.
Maybe if we limit it to specific properties, such as antioxidant
capabilities, we could reduce the amount of nonvirtual work to be done.

The point of this post is? Cattle are, by far, about as high a body mass to
brain mass one can get in a mammal. There may be animals more stupid than
cattle, moose for instance, though that may be due to parasites rather than
physiology. Making them more stupid, without causing them to cease involuntary
functions altogether, would basically turn the animals into the meat equivalent
of a plant, which makes one wonder why there would then be any objection to
eating them if they are in fact mammalian vegetables.

Japanese agricultural methods should be the ideal that vegans aspire to. The way
they breed, coddle and polish each and every apple, tomato, or other fruit,
vegetable, or in this case, cow to acheive the highest possible food quality is
a testament to their tradition of gourmet food excellence.

Instead, what many primitivist vegas seem to want is for everyone to have to eat
pest ridden, rotting vegetable matter without the aid of refrigeration,
freezing, irradiation, canning, preservatives, or any other means of growing,
storing or preparing food in order to reduce spoilage. Such policies can only
result in increasing the amount of wilderness plowed under to eat the masses.
Vegans are the problem, not the solution.

I don't know why they'd be hot to wear. Solar cells are actually rather light,
as are these thermocouples I'm talking about. Utilizing heatsinks behind the
solar cell, venting air up through a sink that has a large amount of surface
area (as much as ten times the surface area of the device footprint) would
dissipate any extra heat in the system. Lets say you have a 20cm x 50cm heat
exchanger on your back, that has a radiative surface area of 1 sq meter. Human
skin evaporating sweat is actually far less efficient than the standard black
body (unless of course, that skin is itself black, which is another thing
entirely), and yanking heat from the body via a fluid cooling system to be
cooled by a combo of the heat exchanger and solid state thermocouples powered by
solar cells (likely mounted on a hat or sunshade).

Does anyone know to what degree the tan or tint a person has in their skin aids
them in cooling? Does dying your skin dark help measurably?

Yes, I think they're a little embarrassed that the great man could say something so apparently
silly, but I don't think he was silly. Turing made no excuses, he knew that If ESP really did exist
then all out current theories about intelligence and consciousness, including his own ideas,
would be sent to the junk pile. Turing never liked ESP but his scientific integrity forced him to
take it seriously because near the end of his life he really thought "the statistical evidence,
at least for telepathy, is overwhelming".

I doubt it one scientist in thousand would say that today. Turing's only mistake was to assume
that the ESP "experiments" done in the 1940's and 50's that seemed so convincing to him were
performed at the same high level as in other areas of science, and not incompetently performed
by carnival barkers (they liked to call themselves "researchers") who were either incredibly
dumb, as naive as children, or just simple frauds.

I think it's been examined enough and it's time to move on to more productive things, but If you
insist on studying ESP then you should go to the experts to help you set up the experimental
protocol, find yourself a good stage magician.

Quite so.  I recommend a great article called "The Most Precious Thing We Have: The Difference Between

The article is about the Turning Point Project.

The Turning Point Project appears to be the first antitechnology organization
aimed specifically at the Singularity - they specifically oppose genetic
engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence.

http://www.turnpoint.org

I'm not sure what the implications are - whether this means that technologists
should try to create the future quietly and unobtrusively, or whether this
means we can make all the noise we want, since the Luddites already know about
us.

I don't *think* these people will have a decisive influence on the future.  I
doubt that Congress or the public-at-large will have strong reactions to
nanotech or AI until the first applications actually make it to the market, or
at least are demonstrated in the laboratory.  But I could be wrong.

Where are these people getting their funding?

Yes...While it's certainly true that the Luddites are,
generally speaking, full of it, one should also never
forget that the forces that mankind is about to
unleash could crush our world like an eggshell. The
Singularity is coming, and NO FLESH SHALL BE SPARED! 

Actually, something like the above, maybe in
combination with Vinge's famous quote, a skull and
some 0110101001/CgACTCACTATAg stuff might make a nice
t-shirt...

You are, of course, factually incorrect, but we've already run those debates.

Ditch the skull.  Primates, including us, have built-in fear reactions to
skulls, because it's generally a bad idea to hang around places where others
of your species have died - whatever killed them might still be around and
able to hurt you.

Besides which, a standard Galactic Shining Human Figure transcendence-shot
does a better job of conveying the theory.

Some of the main players in this project, such as Miyoko Sakashita, have
their personal ideologies moderately well-referenced on the net.  Their
ideal world is a pre-corporate barter economy.

Of course, they don't like the Internet either, since it can't be used for
"ecospiritual" purposes and is a tool of oppression for the Big Corps (tm).

The Turning Point Project has apparently been sued by the Western Fuels
Association for commercial defamation or similar, apparently in response
to a global warming ad in the New York Times.  The regular old corporate
interests aren't terribly pleased with these individuals either.  They
would certainly have an uphill battle, as they are stepping on the toes of
the entrenched powers-that-be with their advertising campaigns.

 
> Where are these people getting their funding?


Apparently from them same sources as the other eco-nazis.  They have close
ties to Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network, and other
eco-fundamentalist organizations.

They are apparently well-funded.  Turning Point Project has, by the
references I've been able to dredge up, been spending in excess of $1.5
Million per year on advertising alone and has been spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars in other venues.  They certainly are not cash poor
and have a non-negligible operating budget.

Ha ha!  Typo.  (Could be quite messy if it's a Greek skatboard;

applications in Costa Rica and Panama include ongoing revenues to be
derived by AMCI's monitoring services."

& Gas, Cross Timbers Oil & Gas, among others. In addition to hardware sales,
AMCI generates monthly revenues from airtime sales. AMCI is an applications
service provider (ASP,) providing data access, tracking, and analysis packages
for customers via the Internet. AMCI continues to actively consider additional
acquisitions or business combinations that would compliment the Company's
core business. www.amc-wireless.com

One of the webmasters appears to be Ang Lee, who is known to be a leader in the
Ruckus Society and trains leftist commandos at the Societie's boot camp.
Miyoko Sakashita is also a co-founder of the Berkeley BREAD Project, a regional
currency program, similar to many that seem to sprouting up in leftist
communities around the country as a means of keeping consumer money in the city.
Amy Bricker seems to work closely with Sakashita, and they both appeared
together for an interveiw on ENN' chat site, the transcript of which is here:

http://chat.enn.com/transcripts/110299turning.htm

Amy also is a project directory with the Center for Food Safety, an anti-GM
group in Washington DC. That she is project director of these two 'groups'
indicates to me that these groups are merely fronts for some larger umbrella
organization. After more searching, I found that she works with TPP director
Andrew Kimbrell on the International Center for Technological Asessment

>From the CTA website at http://www.icta.org
Executive Director
Andrew Kimbrell is a public interest attorney, activist and author. He has been
involved in public interest legal activity in numerous areas of technology,
human health and the environment. After working eight years as the Policy
Director at the Foundation for Economic Trends, Kimbrell established the
International Center for Technology Assessment (CTA) in 1994 and the Center for
Food Safety (CFS) in 1997. Kimbrell has written several books and given numerous
public lectures on a variety of issues. He has been featured on radio and
television programs across the country, including The Today Show, the CBS
Morning Show, Crossfire, Headlines on Trial, and Good Morning America.  He has
lectured at dozens of universities throughout the country and has testified
before congressional and regulatory hearings. In 1994, the Utne Reader named
Kimbrell as one  of the world's leading 100 visionaries. 

Legal Director 
Joseph Mendelson, III joined CTA in the Summer of 1995. He brings a career of
significant litigation, public advocacy and environmental grassroots organizing
to the CFS. Mendelson worked as a staff attorney with the Foundation on Economic
Trends and directed the Friends of the Earth's stratospheric ozone protection
project. He has authored numerous articles in environmental and legal journals.
He has also appeared in numerous media outlets including NBC National News, CNN,
CBS News, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. His writing has appeared
in numerous publications including the Ecologist, Boston College Environmental
Affairs Law Review, Environmental Law Reported, and the Utne Reader. 

The rest of the staff at ICTA:
Kay van der Horst
Research Director,
Director Defense and Security Policy

Amy Bricker
Research Coordinator

Jeff Kellog
Senior Analyst

Jennifer Beck
Administrator

The CTA is part of a big lobbying group in Washington. They take money from
other groups AND corporations to put together 'campaigns'. For example, early
indications are that the opposition to the Bt corn varietal is being funded by
pesticide companies. Their legal work against automobile pollution is funded by
the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other groups which are all funded by
Edison Electric, which obviously has the goal of forcing the widespread
electrification of automobiles. This reminds me of the way that nuke companies
tend to fund groups fighting against the 'Greenhouse Effect', while coal
companies used to fund anti-nuke groups. They are playing against people's
ignorance to gain their own wealth and influence in government. This is just the
sort of thing that many of us are disgusted about with government, however, it
is now US whose ox is being gored. We can sit back and take it, or put together
some group of our own to affect change if ExI itself wants to maintain a
'non-partisan' attitude.

Sure, when world population gets so high, humans displacing so many animals in
the ecosystem, and all that protein going to waste when they die.... ;)  Eat
Soylent Green Crackers!!! Protein Rich and Good for YOU!!!

As humanity speciates, you'll have humans who are plants and live off the sun,
humans who are herbivores and live off of plants, and humans who are carnivores
and live off of herbivores. When the entire ecosystem is made up of intelligent
beings, then intelligence will no longer be a criteria for not eating someone...
when a plant/body wears out, the mind uploads to the metasphere, leaving the
husk for others to feed off of. The only crime will be to eat a body before the
mind has uploaded.

Extropsensorians,

"Driftin' into darkness,
Pretty soon you'll drift away."

Folks who are inclined to mystical explanations of reality tend to take
anything that is not yet explained--or not explained fully or with great
confidence--by the methods of science, and attribute its features to
mystical agencies, and to claim that it cannot now, cannot ever be
explained by science, and that therefore science is--hurray!! we
win--inferior to faith and mysticism.  Well, I want people to be happy.  I
don't want to rain on anyone's parade, to deprive them of the warm feeling
of celebratory ebullience or the pleasures of self-confidence or the sense
of self-importance or superiority which they derive from their faith, but
neither do I bother to spend any significant amount of time in microscopic
analysis of their foolishness.  The discovery of scientific truth requires
time and effort, intellectual talent, discipline, and diligence. Mysticism
on the other hand, springs from intellectual rigidity, insipidity, and
laziness.

>The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception 
>I assume that the reader is
>familiar with the idea of extra-sensory perception, and the meaning of the
>four items of it, viz. 

>telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and

I'll deal with these four in a moment.

>These disturbing phenomena seem to deny

There is "seeming", and then there is "being".  "Seeming" is the gift of
perception and its (sometimes noble and capable, sometimes fawning and
inept) co-conspiritor, intellect.  "Being"--simply "is": egoless,
dispassionate, unconscious, and unselfconscious. 

>all our usual scientific ideas.

Today's usual, tomorrow's trash.  Get over it.  Or at least stop the
incessant whining.

>How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the
>statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. 

My God!, telepathy could be--no, it IS-- real?!  How shocking!  And we
don't understand it!  How unprecedented!  We don't understand everything?!
Oh, the pain!  How devastating to our sense of self-importance!  Oh, the
ignominy!  We had all that twisty glassware, all that stainless steel, the
white crisply-starched lab coats that seemed almost magically to renew
themselves (though we knew of the agency of their renewal:  peons, a lower
order of humanity, with servile obeisance and hushed reverence, shuffling
through the hallowed halls in the dead of night, collecting the barely
wilted raiment of the scientific priesthood for transport to some fetid
cell, where, aided by an underclass of merely *industrial* (pthtoowie!)
machines, they would perform the venal and offensive--but nonetheless
necessary--process of cleansing and restoration), and all those nifty
dials, guages, and flashing lights.  And then to be unmasked and degraded
by the condemnation--the stain--of the existence something as yet unknown
to us.  Oh, Death, please, come and take me now, life is naught but shame
and despair.

>It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts
in.

Everything's hard till you know how to do it.  Do it, or accept the
undeniable fact of your INADEQUACY!!!  And, please, stop your whining.

>Once one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in
ghosts and
>bogies. 

And the tooth fairy, and the Easter bunny, and the Devil, and Santa Claus.
The canonical premise that ignorance proves mysticism, proves something
alright.  It proves that he who believes should not engage in a battle of
wits with a turnip, lest the turnip prevail by the application of superior 
strategy, to wit, prudent, parsimonious, and sagacious SILENCE!!!

>The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of
>physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar,
>would be one of the first to go.

Start with nonsense, and all that follows will be corrupted.  The Greeks
had a word for it: logikos.

>telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
>psycho-kinesis.

(1) telepathy.  The turnip is wise.  It knows its limitations.  It will
never offer a funky theory to explain telepathy.  It will never suffer
embarassmnent.  It will never be proved wrong.  The turnip is a very down
to earth fellow.  It will have no truck with mysticism.

The human organism is shot through with neural tissue, which conducts
electrical currents.  When electrical charges are accelerated they emit
electromagnetic radiation.  The structure which transmits is also apt to
receive, thus the antenna which is the human body and which transmits is
the antenna which is the human body which receives.  This may not be the
final word regarding explanations of telepathy, but it is quite adequate to
demonstrate my point: only the impatient and hysterical unterturnip
intellect would despair/declare that the answer to this question is beyond
the reach of science.

(2) clairvoyance: (definition)The supposed power to see objects or events
that cannot be perceived by the senses.

The gross and obvious sensory capabilities are quite familiar.  Is there
not room for more subtle--perhaps the term "second order" is
apt--perceptual capabilities?  Why is this so hard?  There are radio waves,
and infrared, and magnetic fields whizzing all about us.  Invisible
phenomena which, despite their invisibility, are well known to us,
manipulable, useful, and much used.

Probably those who defined and delimited that which constitutes sensory
perception, were just limited in the depth and detail of their
understanding.  They were new at it.  That was then, this is now.  Perhaps
there's nothing "extra" about it.  Time for a revision then.

He who has his head up his ass knows only dimly lit colonic vistas. Does
this confirm the nonexistence of more aesthetically uplifting visuals?
Also, the tree in the forest falls without a sound.  Right.

(3) Precognition.  Doesn't the Einsteinian plasticity of space and time,
and the as-yet-unresolved weirdness of quantum,...er,...weirdness., give us
plenty of wiggle room here?  No need to drag out that greasy and tattered
fudge-factor cum security blanket called mysticism.  The darkness and
uncertainty of primevil night may have been terrifying to our wild
progenitors.  The modern "darkness" and uncertainty of
that-which-is-yet-unknown is, by contrast, our personal and sacred
invitation to explore and discover all that lies beyond the veil of maya.
The adventure of awakened consciousness.  That's the surprise in the
Crackerjack box of life.  If you're reading this, you're a winner!

Alternate answer: er,... I don't know.  Did that kill me?  Nope.  In fact,
it didn't hurt a bit.  (But then, you knew that ahead of time, didn't you?) 

(4) Tele-kenesis.  Magnets do it.  Masses do it with gravity.  Radio waves
do it.  Action at a distance mediated by an unseen, perhaps-yet-undetected,
but presumably material agency.  That was easy.  Next.

                 ------------------------------------------------------

We'll meet again
Don't know where 
Don't know when,
But I'm sure we'll meet again some sunny day.

			Best, Jeff Davis

This is a link regarding work by Geron (watch their stock price tommorow) 
and Duke University about using telomerase as a target for a universal 
cancer vaccine. If I understand correctly, it would be a vaccine which 
trains the immune system to attack telomerase producing sources.
If it turns out that the telomere theory of aging is correct, and that 
telomerase can prevent/reverse aging, what's the workaround to create an 
anti-aging therapy which is not attacked by the subject's own immune system? 
(besides not getting the cancer vaccine in the first place).

I've a feeling (and it's only my opinion BTW) that he's happy enough that
ppl are at least taking the technology seriously.  I guess he knows that if
he at least gets the ball rolling, sooner or later those who take up the
torch will come full circle and realise the kinds of things he'd talked
about all along, have become possible.
I'm sure he's aware that most radical thinkers aren't appreciated in their
time.  But at least if they take up his ideas, in the future he came come
back and bask in the glory:)  He'd have earned it too.

At least, if it were me, that's how I'd handle it...

(Just my tupence worth)

Ah, Nostalgia,

Reminds me of the time back in the late 80's when a friend of a friend gave
us an old Commodore PET he had in his pigeon loft.  It would flip open like
a car hood, with a little bracing bar!  He'd propped it open and let the
pigeons roost in it:)

I believe it stayed on my friend's shelf for several years after.  Never
did find out what happened to it...

Even worse, I owned and Oric-1 computer many moons ago;)

 Bullshit.

 If you knew people who were mystically inclined, you would know better.
Please quit projecting your personal biases onto others.

 I'm mystically inclined and have no problems with scientific explanations for
phenomena. It does not effect the subjectivity of experiences or the fact that
there are phenomena which we cannot be readily explained because they have
occurred outside of the lab. The late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan was a proponent of
meditation within the Jewish religious tradition and of Kabbalah. He was well
respected. He was also a nuclear physicist and was well respected there as
well. Your explanation does people a disservice with its simple minded
thinking and dislike of people different than yourself.

My understanding is that now that his basic premises are being accepted,
he his moving on to even more radical proposals (i.e. his public
endorsement of cryonics) that he felt were counter-productive to mention
when he was still trying to get people to believe that molecular machines
were even possible.

Given this, it is understandable that he is still on the "outside".

There's great books on this subject; most notably "Leaps of Faith" and of 
course, "Demon Haunted Planet: Science as a Candle in the Dark"

Almost  every situation of ESP and mysticism are explainable and so therefore 
debunkable. When shown the facts, almost everyone agrees. There is only one 
circumstance in which on cannot un-convince someone. That is when they have 
experienced it first hand. I have experienced a video-like crystal clear 
death premonition of a loved one who lived hundreds of miles away and I had 
not seen for years. I cannot ever be convinced otherwise. This does not imply 
that this psychic event happened. It does not imply I agree with the turnip 
that ESP exists. But still my memory of it remains untarnished, unexplained 
and beautiful.

Correction, I *could* be incorrect. As a matter of fact, the above slogan 
can be interpreted in at least two different ways, that's the beauty of it. 
It can either mean extinction or that mankind moves beyond its highly 
limited biological form and uploads (or whatever); "no *flesh* shall be 
spared". Same with the slogan "technology will set you free"; it can be 
interpreted cynically, as a variation on "arbeit macht frei", or 
optimistically, meaning actual liberation by means of technology.

Exactly, and that's what makes it such a potent symbol. There is IMO no 
more appropriate symbol for the end of the human (biological) era than the 
good old skull. It basically says: "one way or the other, biology is finished".
The digital sequence leaves little doubt as to who, or rather *what*, will 
be its successor. The ones and zeros could be projected over the skull, for 
example, and/or form the background. A version with just the DNA sequences 
and the 0/1 would also be nice, as a more subtle approach, but would IMO 
also be less powerful. It *would* be quite suitable for a website, though, 
as a "flowing" animation (a la Matrix). Out of this flowing background you 
can then make your actual logo and/or text slowly materialize. As a matter 
of fact, I think I'll use this on my own website one of these days...One 
slick animation can have a greater impact on us emotional, visually 
oriented humans than a thousand words, after all.

>Besides which, a standard Galactic Shining Human Figure transcendence-shot

This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, Age of Aquarius...la, la! Well, 
I think that we agreed that 50% either way is the most reasonable 
compromise, so both the grim skull and the shiny happy starman are 
legitimate symbols. Whatever you prefer. Selling t-shirts might be a good 
idea, though.

This misses the point in a rather grand way.  As Eliezer pointed out,
we have fear impulses in response to skulls; it triggers our "run
away" response.  The notion of "prevention of harm" becomes foremost
in our minds.  It makes us think "avoid this; avoid this URGENTLY."

You don't want to communicate the notion that "those who view this
T-shirt should avoid the end of biology," if I understand you
correctly.  You want to communicate the *inevitability* of the end of
flesh.  But a skull necessarily registers an "avoid this" response on
the part of the viewer.  So that's not the one you want.

What may perhaps be a consoling thought to many of us, there IS no
symbol for the inevitability of death in Western culture.  Death
itself, and dying, has many symbols: the skull, the grave, the coffin,
the funeral dress; they may suggest inevitability if one is in a
thoughtful mood and you happen to think that death is inevitable.

But, so far, there is no symbol which, itself, communicates that
"death will come to you."  If there were one, that is the symbol that
you'd want to put on your T-shirt.

My biological body, as such, will die.  It may be the case that I can
store a copy of it elsewhere, and use that copy to reconstruct me when
my current body fails.  But even if that happens, the copy will not be
exact; the bodies will be different.

The information stored in the body, of course, need not die.  It can
be replicated exactly, backed up, preserved.  The information has, if
not an infinite lifespan, then a very very long one.

If you think that you are your current body, if you think that you die
if your body dies, (even if there's another copy on hand or ready to
go,) then the fact that the information stored in your body can be
preserved will not lead you to think that you have a chance at
immortality.

With that having been said, people have taken great pains to achieve a
lot less and called that immortality.  Immortality in one's works, for
example.  In one's family line.  In the memories of others.  While I'm
not suggesting that you HAVE to call it "immortality" if I make a copy
of all the information stored in your body, I think you do have to
admit, it's the closest you'll ever be able to get.

This leads me to conclude that whether you believe that you are your
current body or not, your best chance at immortality in the material
world is the recording and storing of your body in a replicable form,
because your current body will die.

When we can figure out how to do this, we'll be right near
Singularity.

---------------

I've heard a number of different charts to a variety of different
things that might be called "Singularity."  There are large deviations
between them; one of the largest rifts is the divide between those who
think that we should build an AI to figure out how to do the relevant
recording, (or, to be more precise, build a seed AI and hope that it
performs the relevant recording), and those who think that we should
try to upload ourselves without help from AIs; that, if we do employ
AIs to help us, we should only use those AIs stupid enough to be
completely controlled by us and to serve our bidding unflinchingly.

(We might also try a little bit of simple biological enhancement to
hurry us along either path.)

Either route will require a lot of thought, and a lot of intelligence.
We have market mechanisms and governments to coordiate this work for
now; this might be sufficient to bring us a seed AI before we blow
ourselves up, if seed AIs are pretty easy, but it's not enough if seed
AIs are very hard.  Uploading is hard by everyone's estimates.

We'll get around to solving one or both of these problems eventually,
but as far as I'M concerned, this problem has a time limit.  If this
problem isn't solved within my lifetime, I have no use for the
solution.  If it isn't solved before we blow ourselves up, then it's
no use to anybody.

Other than biologically enhancing humans (non-PC, forbidden almost
everywhere), acquiring funding (either by performing useful work or by
begging for it, even begging the government), or actual lab work, what
more can be done to bring one of these two about SOON?

The answer is borganization, in which one or more intelligent people
get their heads together and think as a single entity of unified
intelligence.  (Some cybernetics are probably required, but certainly
not the clunky stuff you saw on Star Trek.)  The market and, to a
lesser extent, the government, is designed to coordinate our efforts
in this way, but it does so slowly and inefficiently.  Direct neural
inputs and outputs coupled with even a mechanism as simplistic as an
e-cash market would lead to thoughts and conclusions many times faster
than our society can output.  Everything would happen faster,
including our science.

If we're trying to build a seed, borganizing will get us there
faster.  If we're trying to upload, borganizing will get us THERE
faster, too.

Is borganizing easier (or faster) than simply uploading, or than
building a seed?  I very much think so in the case of uploading, and I
largely believe so in the case of building a seed.  Uploading already
looks like it will be too hard a project to win the race against my
death.  If it requires nanotech, then we risk that nanotech being
abused before it can be used effectively to upload me.  If uploading
does not require nanotech, then the sort of technologies which would
be required for borganization seem to me to be enabling technologies
for uploading.

As for building a seed, I happen to hold a fairly pessimistic view on
the question of how long it will take before we get our seed; I worry
that we won't get it before we blow ourselves up.  My pessimism aside,
it should also be noted that borganization, if not called
"borganization," is also a substantially lower future shock level than
seed AI, especially when you see it as a simple trend of accelerating
communications.  This is mostly based on hunches, which is why I
suggest that I only "largely believe" that borganizing will be easier
than building a seed.

So, right now, I think borganization is my very best chance to survive
the death of my body.  What do you think?

Mike,

I really enjoyed your story of finding a precambrian era VIC-20 that sounds still ready for use!  In storage I have an Atari 800XL with a large library of games that for the time were excellent.  Ironically, I bought it a few years ago at a church bazaar and never hooked it up due to some missing cables.  

Last week while going to throw out the garbage at my apt. complex I came upon a near mint condition copy of the Timothy Leary book, "Design for Dying."  I was quite shocked to see it there in a clean cardboard box next to the dumpster.  There was also a little house on the prairie book and the Jehovah's Witness book called, "You can live forever on paradise earth."  I left those two there...

I really enjoyed reading the book and got a kick out of seeing Eliezer mentioned in it(must be old news here, but not to me).  The end of the book where various people who knew Leary tell stories about him was my favorite.  He was a flawed man but still quite brilliant.

I now rush to the dumpster each morning hoping to find another great book in mint condition just waiting to be adopted!  Maybe I can get a copy of "The Spike" this way! lol!

best wishes,

John :)

I am grateful that information about this philosopher has been shared with me.  I had no knowledge of this man and his ideas.  When I have more time I will pour over the website given.  The concept of the Allmensch appeals to me very much.  The rest of you can be Ubermench but I will go for something a little different...

If nanotech shows up and nobody has a seed AI around, then we might want to
try hacking up some kind of neural-computer interface, or hack up an
interbrain connection by yoking random neurons together.  The trouble is, I
don't see how an interbrain connection could be implemented on the necessary
scale - say, a hundred-million-neuron crossover - without nanotechnology or
something similar.

But if someone figures out how to yoke neurons together using optical fibers,
and automate the implantation process so it can be done on the necessary scale
- then I say go for it!  Get a dozen suicide volunteers; try yoking together
one neuron in every minicolumn, or one minicolumn in every macrocolumn, or
select an entire macrocolumn and wire it up.  Either you'll get telepathy, or
the volunteer will keel over and die, or nothing will happen, or the cognitive
processes will be damaged in ways that range from the subtle to the
horrific...

Obviously this is a measure of desperation.  Realistically, I don't see anyone
getting a permit to use the necessary medical nanotechnology before military
hell breaks loose.  I got my start in human IE, and neurohacking is a
bona-fide path to the Singularity, but currently I'm sticking with seed AI.

Darn it.  It's here in the Yale Library, but they're closed.  (Classes
don't start for a few days.)  However, there's no doubt at all in my
mind that you appear in this book, coauthored with R.U. Sirius.

http://www.spikemagazine.com/1097dead.htm

"Yet Design For Dying's discussion of the various current and future
technologies that could outwit death - everything from cryogenics to
downloading the mind onto hard disk and regenerating the body through
nanotechnology - shows a keen, analytical intelligence at
work. Inevitably, he focuses on drugs as a means of achieving insight
into what happens beyond death. Underpinning his optimism is the Leary
Theory that death is 'a merging with the entire life process.' For all
his hyberbole, Leary's sense of humour remains intact: 'The idea of
keeping someone's head in cryogenic suspension pushes people's taboo
buttons even more than whole-body suspension, which is one fun reason
to do it'. "

Hmmm.  Alllmost.  Doesn't quite do it for me, though it might for
some; to me, the Grim Reaper is just a scary looking skeleton (or
whatever) in a robe w/ scythe.  In that respect, it triggers the
"fear" response more than it makes me think of inevitability.  But
putting the skeleton in clothes or concealing the body entirely does
help subdue that response.  And the Reaper has certainly been used in
the context of inevitability often enough that, under the right
circumstances, it might make one think of inevitability.

Anyway, definitely better than the skull.  I COULD imagine a
compelling T-shirt with a robot in the Reaper's shroud, (you only see
the hands/fingers, which are metal) carrying a scythe w/ 0s and 1s
comprising the blade.

On the front: that image, with the words:  "YOUR BODY WILL DIE"
On the back: the transcendent glowing image, bathed in hex.  "YOUR
BODY WILL DIE \n SAVE YOUR LIFE"

http://transhuman.ai has a great picture of Death in a crosshairs, with the
words "Acting in Self Defense" underneath.  I think that'd go great on a

No... it's on the right track, but you don't notice the cross hairs at
first glace... and even if you do notice them, without the glowing
transhuman, it's not hopeful enough.  Even if you DO notice the
crosshairs, it gives the impression to people who don't think it's
possible to fight back that the sentiment is "Rage against the dying
of the light!" instead of "We can do it!"

(I assume you've read Vernor Vinge's 'A Fire Upon The Deep.' If not,
it's a particularly interesting / entertaining exploration of the type
of composite consciousness you describe. )

How much new sophistication would we need to start playing with these
ideas? We can build tiny electric stimulators. We can build tiny,
sensitive, EMF meters. We can build tiny radio transceivers. One would
think we could put the three together and build a smallish (micro,
rather than nanoscale) brain implant. Two sets could be then
engineered, each listening to a member of the other and firing when
its counterpart detects some threshold signal.

I imagine an experiment with two infant chimps: you inject maybe 500
or 1000 such devices to corresponding sites scattered around the
visual, motor, etc, areas. Don't do any sophisticated wiring - just
let them sit, acting on medium-scale neural groups, and see what
happens. Do the chimps just go into seizure, do their brains learn to
ignore the affected groups, or are the self-organizing properties of
the developing brain powerful enough that something interesting
happens?  (Has someone already written this story?)

Anyway - the general idea you raise is attractive. I'm sick of being
the sole generator of my own thoughts, stuck listening to the same
stack of patterns all day. Being locked behind a single pair of eyes
is claustrophobic, and squeezing one's inner life through inadequate
language skills feels like dropping message bottles off a desert
island. I can't imagine what poor eye-sight must have been like before
glasses. Maybe one day we'll look back at existential loneliness the
same way.

I hereby appeal to everyone on the list to send me a complete list of the
books in which I appear.  The ones I know about are:

"The Spike" by Damien Broderick
"Design for Dying" by R.U. Sirius and Timothy Leary

I would also like to know about any major media appearances - mentions in
magazines, articles in the New York Times, debates on 60 Minutes, PBS
docu-dramas based on my true story, interviews on the nightly news, et cetera.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

Well, he's dead now. So he isn't enlightened anymore. I equate the term "total
man" with "enlightened master" because the two terms seem to me to describe
identical beings. I put Mohammed in the same category with Buddha, Moses, Lao
Tzu, Christ, Krishna, Socrates, and Kabir because all these were fully awakened
beyond words. So, why did you single out Mohammed from the others?

That itself should tell you that some kind of disconnect with reality is 
taking place.  What you're saying is close enough to what I heard 20 years 
ago that I'm wondering if there hasn't simply been a shift in technique.

Funny you should mention that...  I perhaps got the idea for the "Truth 
Machine" from my 2nd hand info on Scientology.  In the late '70's, when the 
voice stress response stuff first broke surface, it occured to me that one 
could found a real profit making revolutionary movement on a real "Truth 
Machine."  I even approached a number of high-tech companies about 
developing a product.  By the time I met Halperin and laid out the plot for 
the novel to him, I had given up on the idea, as I ran into too much NIH.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - An enzyme that cancer cells use to keep themselves
immortal" might provide a target for a universal cancer vaccine, researchers said on Tuesday.

Experiments in mice suggest a vaccine based on the enzyme telomerase might work against
a range of cancers, a team at Duke University in North Carolina and Geron Corp. <GERN.O>
reported. [...]

Gilboa's team found that the active part of telomerase can stimulate development of immune
cells that can kill several different kinds of mouse and human cancers.

Many researchers are working on cancer vaccines. But there are many different
kinds of cancers, and the cells often have their own specific surface proteins that the
vaccines target. These proteins are known as tumor-specific antigens.

"The thinking has been that because every cancer is different -- melanoma, breast, et cetera
 -- that each cancer has its own specific set of antigens that must be used for a vaccine,"
said Gilboa. "We're looking for a universal antigen -- one antigen to try to treat every cancer patient."
Telomerase might do the trick, he said.

"However, by itself, telomerase is not a strong antigen, so to make an effective, broadly
applicable cancer vaccine we will need to optimize and possibly combine it with other
universal antigens," he added. His team's vaccine stimulated an immune response that
slowed tumor growth of melanoma, breast and bladder cancers implanted into mice.
It also worked in human cells in laboratory dishes, they reported. The cells produced
immune responses that killed a variety of patients' cancer cells in the lab.

Actually, last time I checked the online computer auction sites, there were 
several VIC-20's and C64's both for sale and wanted.  I still have my 
original VIC-20 somewhere, and my C-64.  They probably still work.  I ran a 
little word-processing business in the early '80's on the C64 and a Brother 
HR15 daisy-wheel, which cost me $500.  In the mid-80's, the C64 came with 
the GEOS GUI OS, with full desktop publishing capability, on about 30K of 
free RAM and a 165K floppy drive.  Today, there are people surfing the web 
on C64's.  Amazing how little real advance we've made, due to MicroSloth...

Enlightenment happens when the ego disappears. Consequently, "you" become
something totally incomprehensible in your current state of consciousness.
Despite that no one can convey the meaning of enlightenment in words, verbal
descriptions and poetic references can provide guidance for attainment.
Similarly, no one can tell you how it feels to be in love. You have to
experience it for yourself.
Since hope derives from ego, hoping for enlightenment produces yet another
obstacle to its attainment.

Just a few thoughts:  The other night I accidentally tuned in to "Red
Dwarf."  The computer convinced one of the characters to erase part of its
"memory."  Problem was that it had read every single book ever written -
supposedly stored in its "library" - and was bored.  So it wanted all the
Agathe Christy novels erased so that it could have the pleasure of reading
them again.

Question: What is the precise difference between having the novels in
"memory" and in "storage?"  Presumably the computer could access the
information in the library via any number of algorythmic searches or even
spawn intelligent agents to do more sophisticated access to the actual
informational content and meaning.  What additional factor is involved in
actually reading it that isn't present in intelligent transclusion?

In terms related to uploading, what would be the difference between my
moving the library of congress - or just a single book - into my RAM or the
equivalent and my actually "reading" the material in question?

If nanotech shows up and nobody has a seed AI around, then we might want to
try hacking up some kind of neural-computer interface, or hack up an
interbrain connection by yoking random neurons together.  The trouble is, I
don't see how an interbrain connection could be implemented on the
necessary
scale - say, a hundred-million-neuron crossover - without nanotechnology or
something similar.

But if someone figures out how to yoke neurons together using optical
fibers,
and automate the implantation process so it can be done on the necessary
scale
- then I say go for it!  Get a dozen suicide volunteers; try yoking
together
one neuron in every minicolumn, or one minicolumn in every macrocolumn, or
select an entire macrocolumn and wire it up.  Either you'll get telepathy,
or
the volunteer will keel over and die, or nothing will happen, or the
cognitive
processes will be damaged in ways that range from the subtle to the
horrific...

Obviously this is a measure of desperation.  Realistically, I don't see
anyone
getting a permit to use the necessary medical nanotechnology before
military
hell breaks loose.  I got my start in human IE, and neurohacking is a
bona-fide path to the Singularity, but currently I'm sticking with seed AI.

As List member Hal Finney wrote:
"Extropianism is a philosophy of life. Max More, editor of Extropy, has identified five Extropian principles [referring to an earlier version of the Extropian Principles]:
- Boundless Expansion 
- Self Transformation 
- Dynamic Optimism 
- Intelligent Technology 
- Spontaneous Order

"You can see that the basic point is a belief that the future will allow virtually unlimited expansion in the possibilities for our own personal lives. Extropians reject limits imposed by outsiders on what we can do and what we can become. We embrace the future, with all of its awe-inspiring possibilities.

"[Referring to the reading list at the Extropy Institute website,] The role of [these] books is to show that these aren't just idle musings and hopes, but are well-grounded expectations about what we are going to have to work with in the next century. Without having read those books, such common-place Extropian ideas as immortality or a world without governments might seem absurd.

"If you haven't read these books but want to ask questions about these and other Extropian ideas, the problem is that the answer is usually going to be, first read the book. You can't answer a question about the possibility for [physical] immortality in a page or two, not in any kind of convincing way.

"Now, after you've read some of these books, you still may not agree that all of these ideas are practical, but at least you can discuss them on common ground with other list members. That kind of discussion is practical, helpful, and informative. Extropians are not dogmatists. If there are practical problems standing in the way of the realization of their hopes and ideals, we should be discussing them now, so that solutions can be found.

"Of course, some people will be opposed to Extropian ideas not because they seem impractical, but because they seem immoral. Re-read the list of Extropian principles above. If you don’t agree with them, if you don’t agree that we should attempt to break through all the limits that constrain us today, then you probably won’t benefit from discussion with Extropians.

"To sum up, the Extropians lists welcome members who share an interest in the exciting, optimistic, future-oriented philosophy of Extropianism. If you're new to these ideas, they can offer suggestions to help you find books, authors, and other resources to learn more about what we can and will become. If you're more experienced, they offer discussion and feedback with a high level of quality and responsiveness. The future is coming, and the Extropian lists offer you a chance to get ready for the fantastic opportunities that await us all."

I don't know about you guys, but the recent trends among Corporate
America to strengthen Intellectual Property Laws beyond the DMCA has got
me very concerned and agitated.  I'm all for seeing creators of
intellectual property be compensated fairly for their work, but recent
moves within our legal system are really starting to disturb me.  I
think the story "The Right to Read" by Stallman at:

http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/right-to-read.html

paints a very compelling reason to limit the protections of current
intellectual property.  The intent of copyright in the first place was
to grant the creator, for a *limited* time, a monopoly on that idea for
personal or financial gain as an incentive to spur further creativity in
society.  But now corporations have managed to co-opt this principle by
extending such protections indefinitely.  Its been the principles of
'Fair Use' that have allowed our knowledge pool to grow and evolve.  It
has been compellingly argued that if Shakespeare were alive today, he
would not have been able to publish the majority of his plays under
current IP restrictions.  Regardless of any other free-market principles
that's a pretty sobering thought.  Limiting and locking up knowledge to
the extent that corporations are now trying to do can only mean a deeper
poverty of knowledge and capital down the road.  As a person who
believes in a diverse competitive free-market the current trends in
Corporate America have really gotten me down.  Is it time for a
reassessment?  Is capitalism the problem, or is what we have so
perturbed by regulation that it can't truly be called capitalism?
Either way, their is definitely a growing unrest as to what many people
see as Corporate Power gone out of control.  The recent scuffle in
Seattle is only the beginning of more civil unrest over the issue of
Corporate Profits vs. Individual Liberties.

Jusr in the last year or so Microsoft's has campaigned successfully to
change existing ownership laws and rights in 5 states to favor their
leasing paradigm.  Is this a sign of much worse things to come?  Already
Microsoft has taken a strong position that when you buy their software
by saying you do not own your copy, you are only licensing the right to
*use* it.  And along with that granted right to license this software
you will be subject to all the stipulations of said license.

Beyond the fact that I wholehearted disagree with the ludicrous idea
that I  can't own software I buy, ultimately Microsoft has every right
to do with their product (I mean service) as they please.  This is all
encompassed in their their new .NET strategy by the way.  Luckily for
now, LINUX is defying this leasing model.  But what really bothers me
about this is the trend of many software companies moving away from
private ownership of software into the 'leasing a service' paradigm.

--> Already Microsoft has put into some of their licensing agreements
stipulations forbidding any user of their service from disparaging the
company in any way.  In other words, as long as your using a Microsoft
product (damn, I mean service) you have no freedom of speech, as you
signed that right away when you signed up for their service.  If you
violate this part of the license they'll yank your privileges.  It is my
understanding that a new feature implemented in Office Suite 2000, has a
mandatory connection to Big Brother (damn, I mean Microsoft).  If a
connection is severed for a certain period of time your license will be
revoked.

Hopefully big business around the world will not catch on to this nifty
loophole in our legal system as a way of stripping everyone of their
freedoms as a condition to use their service.  Of course you don't have
to use their service, but if they are the only game in town (through
sufficient merging and consolidation), your only alternative would be to
live in the proverbial tent.

I have always tried to maintain freemarket principles, but when I see
corporations gaining this much power over individual lives, I begin to
doubt those beliefs and my appreciation of capitalism as usual.  Now,
here is a scary question - is capitalism now at odds with the spirit of
a free market, and more importantly individual liberty?  For those with
strong reactions to this question, I am urging you to respond as
intelligently and rationally as you can.

Paul Hughes

P.S. Lets not forget the DeCSS case as a clear cut example of how big
business can get laws changed to successfully infringe on freedom of
speech.

Heh... not very likely!  The primary job of the Ethics branch of CoS is to
PREVENT anybody from "altering the tech"...  It's the biggest ethics
violation there is.

Besides... my knowledge of the CoS IS from 20 years ago.

I'm sorry phil...  I'm fairly new to this group and I don't know you by
reputation, so I can't tell whether this is meant as a joke or if you are
being completely factual or even delusional.

My guess would be the second option,  but I'm so gullible that I ended up a
member of the CoS for 3 years.  When I was young, my dad told me I was
gullible... and I believed him. ö¿ö

Perhaps, for the computer, intelligent transclusion *is* "reading" the
book.  Given the attitude of the builders of the ship Red Dwarf (for
humans, by humans - perfectly understandable, given that at the start of
RD, the Singularity is still a ways away), it makes sense that the
library would be stored as, say, ASCII text English.  The AI's memory
must be in some other format, if only because ASCII text English is
unsuitable for perfectly representing the memory of a sentient being.
The computer was apparently made to think of itself as similar to a
human, so it could well use the metaphor of "reading" something by
translating text into whatever format its memory uses.

The side effects.  Wear and tear on the book, transportation to/from the
LOC, temporary inavailability of the material to other patrons of the
LOC, memory of having done one process or the other, and so forth
(probably including a siimilar litany for side effects of translating it
into your RAM, depending on how that is implemented).  And this is
assuming your auto-reading software (which translates from text to your
memory format) perfectly duplicates whatever nuances you'd interpret the
book with when "actually" reading it.  (Which is unlikely since the
book's contents would presumably go through a faster - and thus,
presumably different - path to get to your memory, unless the paths are
specifically engineerd to produce identical results.  Unless the
differences are detrimental to your use of the contents - which is
probably true of imperfect "learned" skills like reading - then why
would you want to duplicate the nuances - and bugs - of the "natural"
approach exactly?)

Just a minor point about the above, the repetition of "innovative

Some more about experiments already performed 
http://www.princeton.edu/~rdnelson/index.html

and also this very speculative paper published in 
Foundations of Physics, Vol. 21, pp. 197-207,
1991, (c) Plenum Press.

Title:          Biological Utilisation of Quantum NonLocality[1]
Authors:     Brian D. Josephson[2] !!! and Fotini Pallikari-Viras[3]
(square brackets denote footnotes, round brackets references)

Abstract: The perception of reality by biosystems is based on
different, and in certain respects more effective principles than
those utilised by the more formal procedures of science.  As a
result, what appears as random pattern to the scientific method can
be meaningful pattern to a living organism.  The existence of this
complementary perception of reality makes possible in principle
effective use by organisms of the direct interconnections between
spatially separated objects shown to exist in the work of J.S. Bell.

1. INTRODUCTION

Bell(1,2)[4] has given arguments that appear to demonstrate
the existence of direct interconnections between spatially separated
objects.  But at the same time there are arguments(4-6) that appear
to show that no real physical manifestations of these
interconnections actually exist. The thesis developed in this paper
is that it is only from the point of view of quantum mechanics that
these connections appear to be unphysical, and that there is a
different, complementary point of view, one associated specifically
with the activities of living organisms, in terms of which the
interconnections may be very concretely real, and capable of being
put to practical use.

The logic of the complementary point of view to which
reference has just been made is that the activities of living
organisms are governed by predominant principles (survival, and
optimality of the conditions of life) different to those of the
scientist (conformity to certain restrictions that are considered
necessary for "good" science).  The perceptual processes of
organisms (e.g. processes such as vision) perform their functions in
general very effectively, but in a way that is hard to delineate in
rigorous scientific terms.  It will be argued that as a result of
this difference the knowledge possessed by biosystems and the
knowledge possessed by science are qualitatively different, leading
to an ability of life to make use of Bell's non-locality in a way
that is not possible in the different situation of a controlled
scientific experiment.

The discourse that follows begins (Sec. 2) with a review of
Bell's theorem, discussing in particular the antithesis between the
way that Bell's argument appears to demonstrate the existence of
direct action at a distance, while at the same time quantum
calculations lead to the result that any such effects will disappear
under statistical averaging.  Experiments on certain unusual human
abilities(7,8) suggest that the non-local effects do not invariably
disappear under averaging, a result that the present paper seeks to
explain.

The explanation proposed here involves the issue of exactly
what kind of randomness is being presupposed when one performs such
statistical averaging.  An answer to this question in general terms
is provided by causal (non-statistical) models of the phenomena of
the quantum realm such as that of Bohm(9).  This kind of
interpretation assumes the relevance of particular probability
distributions in an appropriate phase space.  The possibility that
one needs in general to deal with coexisting multiple
representations of reality (complementarity) is then considered, the
implication being that different kinds of probability distributions
to those relevant to quantum mechanical predictions may be
appropriate in cases such as those involving biosystems.  From the
point of view of a biosystem itself, this possibility translates
into one that biosystems can have more discriminative knowledge of
nature than is obtainable by quantum measurement.  As a result of
this higher degree of discrimination, the evolutionary and
developmental processes characteristic of biosystems can, given
suitable initial conditions, lead to focussed probability
distributions that make possible the kind of human abilities (i.e.
psi functioning) to which reference has been previously made.

2. BELL'S THEOREM AND NONLOCAL CONNECTIONS

We first review Bell's theorem.  Its domain of relevance is
of a type of system, which we shall refer to here as an EPR-type
system, first discussed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen(10).
EPR-type systems are systems wherein a quantum object breaks up into
parts which after separating are observed by measuring instruments
that have no links of a type that can transmit information by normal
means to each other.  A typical example of such a system, which has
been studied experimentally(11), involves measurement of the
correlated polarisations of the photons emitted in a two-photon
decay sequence. Bell's theorem consists of an inequality applicable
to the correlations observed in a range of different measurements,
and from it one can derive the corollary that no local model of
physical reality can exist whose statistical predictions would be in
agreement with those of quantum mechanics: in Bell's own words(1),
if nature behaves in accordance with the statistical predictions of
quantum mechanics then "there must be a mechanism whereby the
setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another
instrument, however remote".  Experimental results, while not being
totally conclusive, are such as to point towards this conclusion
being valid.

The existence of such remote influences or connections is
suggested more directly by experiments on phenomena such as
telepathy (the direct connection of one mind with another) and
psychokinesis (the direct influence of mind on matter), both of
which are examples of so-called psi functioning or psychic
phenomena.  The reader interested in learning about these phenomena
(which are often disregarded by orthodox science) is referred to the
recent article by Radin and Nelson(8) which analyses experiments
relating to them, as well as to the references cited therein (and
especially those relating to the publications of R.G. Jahn and
collaborators, and of H. Schmidt), and to Ref. 7[5].

3. DO THE INTERCONNECTIONS PERSIST UNDER STATISTICAL AVERAGING?

Ordinary quantum mechanical calculations, if one excludes
from consideration proposals such as that of Walker(12) that contain
special ad hoc modifications to the conventional theory, do not seem
to provide any clear mechanism leading to the occurrence of
phenomena where the effects of non-local connections are manifested
directly. Indeed, conventional quantum mechanical calculations(4,5)
suggest that whatever effects changing the setting of a measuring
device may have on _individual_ remote events, the _statistical
distribution_ of such events remains unaltered.  Mermin(6) concludes
as a result that "The manifestation of this 'action at a distance'
is revealed only through a comparison of the data independently
gathered at A and at B" (the locations of the two measuring
instruments).  He characterises the measurements carried out at the
remote location as being "entirely random".

But what is "entirely random"?  What appears to be random in
a given situation depends on the context, on what one knows and on
one's point of view. Coded messages, the roll of a die, output from
a computer, or the movements of a person operating a piece of
machinery may all appear random if one does not know the relevant
details (the code that is used in the coded message, the exact
manner in which the die is thrown, what the computer program or
piece of machinery is and what it is doing) and yet if one knows
this information many of the details of such phenomena can be
understood. An alternative description of microphysical reality to
that provided by quantum mechanics, if any such exists, may be
associated with a different kind of statistical average.  What seems
to be noise may no longer be noise, and the theorem implying no
manifestations of interconnectedness for the statistical average may
no longer apply.

But do situations actually exist in nature whose
descriptions involve less randomness in particular aspects than
quantum mechanics implies?  In the past, it might have been stated
unconditionally that von Neumann had under very general conditions
disproved the existence of such a possibility, but it is now
recognised(13) that the supposed proofs of these assertions
contained assumptions that are in fact unjustifiable.  There exist
arguments(14-17) that complementary descriptions to those of quantum
mechanics can and in all probability do occur. Detailed discussion
of this issue will play a central role in the analysis that follows.

4. CAUSAL INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

In the context of the present problem it is useful to think
in terms of causal interpretations of quantum mechanics.  These are
models where the observed indeterminacy is a consequence of
uncertainty of the actual state of a system whose dynamical laws in
themselves are completely deterministic.  Bohm's causal model(9)
involves an ensemble of particles distributed in phase space with a
particular self-consistent probability distribution function and
moving in accordance with certain deterministic laws.  The
statistical predictions of quantum mechanics are reproduced exactly
in a way that avoids the usual introduction of unclear and arbitrary
assumptions concerning measurement, wave function collapse, or
separation of a system into observer and observed.  The non-locality
which Bell showed to be implicit in quantum mechanics is _explicit_
in Bohm's causal model, in that the motion of the particles in the
model is governed by an interaction, determined by the quantum wave
function of the system, that is non-local.

In most common situations, averaging over the particle
positions in the causal model makes the mean direct influence of one
particle on another at large distances negligibly small. This is not
so, however, in EPR-type situations where the wave function has a
non-decomposability property which makes this interaction at a
distance significantly different from zero even at long range(13).
But, even in these situations, once we take an ensemble average,
using the special distribution function in phase space that assures
the statistical equivalence of the causal interpretation and quantum
mechanics, we revert to the quantum mechanical prediction that
statistically no influence at a distance can be demonstrated.  One
may ask, however, why only these special distribution functions
should apply.  Is there anything absolute about the ignorance
implicit in the use of these particular distribution functions? The
argument will be made in the following that other distribution
functions, with different statistical properties, are relevant in
other contexts, especially those associated with life.

Situations where a change in context leads to a new kind of
statistical distribution becoming relevant are indeed commonplace in
science: they occur for example whenever a phase transition occurs
that leads to a breaking of symmetry.  As a result of symmetry
breaking, statistical distributions that are "asymmetric" with
regard to this symmetry may come into existence in situations where
previously only symmetric distributions were observable or relevant.
Analogously, it can be anticipated that special situations will
exist whose natural description involves probability distributions
other than the particular ones that arise in the "quantum
formalism".

5. MULTIPLE DESCRIPTIONS OF REALITY

We now discuss in some detail this idea that rather than a
single, universal, description of reality (such as that provided by
quantum mechanics) being appropriate in all circumstances, more than
one complementary or alternative form of knowledge may exist(14-17).
This state of affairs is most simply understood with reference to a
special feature of the quantum domain related to quantum
indeterminism, which we shall characterise as the _loss of universal
determinism_.  This latter term is intended to reflect the fact that
in this domain quantum indeterminism renders impossible the making
of exact predictions on the basis of a _universal formula_ (which
would be possible in principle in classical physics if the relevant
dynamical laws such as Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws were
known).  We hypothesise that two alternative strategies are possible
for dealing with the loss of universal determinism. The first, the
method of science, is to retain conformity with the demands of
reproducibility and universality by the device of replacing the no
longer possible strict determinism by _statistical determinism_.
The outcome of this approach is quantum mechanics.  The second, a
method that is in general terms favoured by life, involves
renouncing the demand for universal knowledge in favour of more
specialised and purposeful adaptations to the more limited class of
situations that the organism or organisms concerned is liable
_naturally_ to encounter in the course of its life.  A human being
learns, for example, the language that is spoken in his or her own
particular environment, rather than language in general.

These two strategies lead in different directions.  The
strategy of science leads towards the accurate specification of
form, while that of life leads in the direction of meaning.  These
two directions, form and meaning, are the two components of David
Bohm's concept relating to the universal nature of things,
_soma-significance_(18).  Meaning is an aspect of reality tied to
the achievement of goals and to specific context that is
sufficiently subtle and complex as not to be representable by any
closed formula. Furthermore, the technique of statistical averaging
is especially irrelevant in the context of meaning, since its
influence in general is to transform the _meaningful_ into the
_meaningless_.  It is not useful to consider the meaning of a
particular word averaged over all languages, and computing the
statistics of word order and frequency in a discourse tells one very
little about the meaning of the discourse.  Investigations into
meaning(18,19) are investigations in a different direction to that
in which one is led by scientific investigations into reproducible
form.

But science is involved with the accurate specification of
form, and this enforces the kind of _formal_ specification of nature
characteristic of quantum measurement theory.  This contrasts with
the philosophical informality of classical physics with its naive
realism.  The perceptual and interpretative processes of living
organisms do not admit of the formal specifications demanded by
quantum measurement theory.  Therefore, as discussed in Ref. 17,
there is no good reason to identify the class of experiments defined
according to the precepts of quantum measurement theory with the
category of all investigable phenomena.  Indeed, the quantum
formalism does not apply in any obvious way to _natural_ situations,
situations such as those of the phenomena of life that come into
being by chance rather than by scientific design, and the common
belief that it should be possible in some way to apply quantum
mechanics to natural situations just as readily as to the controlled
experiment is one that seems to owe its existence to an
extrapolation that cannot, under close examination, be justified.

6. RANDOMNESS AND FOCUSSING

These arguments lead us to the conclusion that, because of
the different kind of perceptual and interpretative processes
characteristic of life compared with those of science, living
organisms can possess knowledge that is more detailed in certain
aspects than is the knowledge specified by the quantum theory.  One
may talk in terms of higher discrimination and selectivity, which
improvements can be attributed a different kind of contact with
nature. By way of analogy, it can be compared to a process that
makes contact with individual atoms, relative to one that makes
contact with the macroscopic aspects of a system only.

>From the point of view of a causal model such as that of
Bohm's, alternative kinds of probability distribution in phase space
become relevant. In general terms, these distributions can be
characterised as being highly focussed in relation to the organism's
specific goals.  Such focussed behaviour in living organisms is
typified by, for example, the activities of a tightrope walker, or
of a darts player.  Efficient focussing comes into being naturally
over the course of time as the consequence of processes of trial and
error learning occurring during the developmental process.  Our
assumption in relation to psi functioning is that here also the
relevant probability distributions are highly focussed in relation
to goals, in a way that may become more effective over time as
development through learning takes place.

6.1.  AN ILLUSTRATION

The kind of focussing process involved can be illustrated
with a simple example.  This consists of a coil attached by a length
of wire to an ammeter a short distance away.  The meter needle can
be caused to deflect by moving a magnet in the vicinity of the coil.
A person who does not understand the facts of magnetism and
attempting to produce a meter deflection in a particular direction
will at first move the magnet randomly and hence produce deflections
in a random direction.  But he may in time discover the principle
that is involved and utilise the magnet in a non-random way, and
gain thus the ability to produce deflections in a prescribed
direction at will.  In exemplification of the processes discussed
above, his learning process changes an initially random distribution
of magnet movements into one focussed with regard to the goal, the
principles referred to above. The proposal being made here is
essentially that mechanisms of a similar kind may be operative at a
_microscopic_ level in biosystems.

7. SPECULATIVE MODELS

In the biological world, evolution through natural selection
tends to give rise to adaptive elaborations of preexisting
phenotypes (manifest behaviour).  Thus a primitive sensitivity to
light becomes elaborated into more discriminating sensitivities and
ultimately into fully detailed vision.  In the case of psi one may
similarly anticipate the development of forms of organisation of the
nervous system capable of interacting non-locally with other
systems.  Such organisation has been discussed by C.N. Villars(20),
who starts with the assumption that in a number of types of
situation encountered in a quantum mechanical context, including
EPR-type situations, microphysical objects function as "centres of
perception", acting as if sensitive to non-local information.
Villars hypothesises that somewhere within the nervous system forms
of organisation of microphysical objects exist capable of
amplifying, selecting and combining the perceptions through
non-local connections of individual microphysical objects, in a way
analogous to the way in which the ordinary senses function through
the working together of many subunits.  As a result we can have
perceptions of distant objects and events through the non-local
connections in the same kind of way as we acquire perception of the
more local environment through the ordinary senses.  The scope and
form of such perceptions at a distance would be a function of the
particular forms of organisation and activity present in these
postulated sense-like processes.  Except for the absence of a
theoretical mechanism for overcoming the limitations of ordinary
quantum descriptions by making use of an underlying causal model,
Villars' proposals are similar to those advocated here.

Further similar proposals have been made by Bohm(21) also,
based on his causal interpretation.  His conclusion is that while,
in principle, coherent non-local effects of one system upon another
are possible, in practice such connections are "fragile, and easily
broken by almost any disturbance or perturbation", and that they
would occur only at very low temperatures or under special
conditions such as those pertaining in the EPR situation.  But in
the picture advocated here, life has the ability, exemplified by the
example of the tightrope walker, to learn under conditions that are
not excessively unfavourable to it to neutralise of compensate for
the effects of external disturbances.  Such compensation capacity we
assume to be functionally effective in respect to the "fragility"
referred to by Bohm also.

A comment by Bohm et al.(9) regarding the understanding of
superconductivity in the causal interpretation provides a clue as to
what kind of overall organisation might be relevant for psi
functioning.  This situation is described in the following terms:

"In the superconducting state of a many-electron system,
there is a stable overall organised behaviour, in which the
movements are coordinated by the quantum potential so that the
individual electrons are not scattered by obstacles.  One can say
indeed that in such a state, the quantum potential brings about a
coordinated movement which can be thought of as resembling a 'ballet
dance'."

The assumption of a superconducting-like state provides an
example of a context where different organisms can be highly
correlated.  Such a state may be relevant to the origin of life, or
to the Gaia hypothesis of Lovelock and Margulis(22).  Perturbations
such as an increase in temperature cause the coordinated
organisation to break up, and this would provide a mechanism by
which the amount of linking of an individual organism to other
systems through non-local interconnections could be adjustable.  One
may imagine that life may exist from the beginning (cf. Ref. 22) as
a cooperative whole directly interconnected at a distance by Bell
type non-local interactions, following which modifications through
the course of evolution cause organisms to be interconnected
directly with each other and with objects to an extent that is
adapted to circumstances.  One can see conceptual similarities
between psi skills and ordinary skills, e.g. between the perceptual
skills of hearing and telepathy on the one hand, and between the
forms of control of matter involved in the control of the body and
in psychokinesis on the other.  From this point of view, it is only
in regard to the mode of interaction that the ordinary phenomena and
the analogous paranormal ones differ from each other.  These
analogies will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The theories discussed here have the feature, in contrast to
that of quantum mechanics, of being qualitative rather than
quantitative.  This may be an unavoidable correlate of such aspects
of nature, stemming from a fundamental irreproducibility of biology
and of the phenomena connected with the indeterminism of the quantum
domain.

8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

The goal of this paper has been that of gaining some
understanding, within the framework of conventional science, of
phenomena such as telepathy and psychokinesis which (particularly in
terms of the actual experience(23,24)) seem to involve some form of
direct contact at a distance.  While the non-local correlations
found in EPR-type systems seem at first sight(20) to provide a
scientifically valid basis for such direct contact (particularly for
the case of telepathy which has many features that parallel those of
EPR-type correlations), calculations using the formal apparatus of
quantum theory suggest that any such connections will be purely
random and thus unusable.  But the self-consistent and completely
logical multiple-description view of knowledge advocated here, an
alternative to the conventional view that all knowledge may be
reduced to quantum mechanical knowledge, allows life to have its own
potentialities, beyond what the constraints of "good scientific
method" will allow, for knowing and for acting on the basis of such
knowing.  Included in these categories of acting and knowing are
psychic functioning.

The present theory parallels in a number of respects the
theory of Walker(12) with its postulate that the statistical
outcomes of quantum phenomena can be modified by consciousness, and
the paper of Stapp(25), in which creative mind has a similar
function. These different approaches may all be representations of
slightly different aspects of the same underlying truth, gained by
taking as a starting point a range of different points of view.

Of course the above is supposed to read: "We do NOT allow personal attacks"...

Somehow that slipped through readings by several people, but was caught

Remember when Mike Lorrey quoted a Jim Halperin character who said, "some people just need killin!"  Well, how about this, "some people just are askin' for a personal attack!"  So, when someone libelously attacks a member of our little tribe we will open up a ten megaton can of whup-ass on them...

North Pole not as wet as reported 
                
The Associated Press 

NEW YORK (August 29, 2000 10:07 a.m) - Citing a report in The New York
Times, The Associated Press erroneously reported Aug. 19 that open water
had been spotted on the North Pole for the first time in 50 million years,
a possible sign of global warming. 

In a correction Tuesday, the Times said it had misstated the normal
conditions of sea ice at the pole. It said open water probably has
occurred there before because the Arctic Ocean is about 10 percent
ice-free during a typical summer. 

The Times also said the lack of ice at the North Pole is not necessarily a
result of global warming.

Just recently, a friend bought a c64 + games, disk drive, all the good
stuff, for a total of A$10. I thought "Here we go!", and went round to his
place to check it out. All those cool old games: bruce lee, bard's tale,
blue max, spy hunter, wooo, forget the playstation, let the good times roll.

Do you know how truly crap those games are today? I was so disillusioned.
Someone has replaced the C64 of my memory, with a terrible, awful, boring
piece of junk. It's a conspiracy, I tell you. Mr Goddard, forget that Waco
stuff; the conspiracy to make C64s look like shocking hunks of crap is
afoot. Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, they're all in on it. And the government.
Which govt? All of them!

Somewhere in a huge warehouse under the pentagon, next to some alien
foetuses and the odd box of reports on mass genetic modification
experiments, are row upon row of boxes of the real C64s, wrapped up to hide
the shining, pure brilliance which naturally eminates from them. That's what
the alien abductions are about, you know; they implant all these false
memories of surgical procedures and naughty probes to hide the fact that
they are swapping your C64 for a pod version, lifeless, spiritless,
unnatural.

Crap, there's someone trying to break down the door; just got time to hit

Actually, last time I checked the online computer auction sites, there were
several VIC-20's and C64's both for sale and wanted.  I still have my
original VIC-20 somewhere, and my C-64.  They probably still work.  I ran a
little word-processing business in the early '80's on the C64 and a Brother
HR15 daisy-wheel, which cost me $500.  In the mid-80's, the C64 came with
the GEOS GUI OS, with full desktop publishing capability, on about 30K of
free RAM and a 165K floppy drive.  Today, there are people surfing the web
on C64's.  Amazing how little real advance we've made, due to MicroSloth...

Another remote possibility is a conjecture that all the information you were, is somehow stored automatically in the Universe. Hence, the replaying of such an occurence of our lifetimes, world history, would re-initiate the reality that we know. That would be when an outside force could mannipulate the spacetime we have (are) experiencing. This is alikeable, idea, but is it falsifiable?

My biological body, as such, will die.  It may be the case that I can
store a copy of it elsewhere, and use that copy to reconstruct me when
my current body fails.  But even if that happens, the copy will not be
exact; the bodies will be different.

The information stored in the body, of course, need not die.  It can
be replicated exactly, backed up, preserved.  The information has, if
not an infinite lifespan, then a very very long one.

If you think that you are your current body, if you think that you die
if your body dies, (even if there's another copy on hand or ready to
go,) then the fact that the information stored in your body can be
preserved will not lead you to think that you have a chance at
immortality.

With that having been said, people have taken great pains to achieve a
lot less and called that immortality.  Immortality in one's works, for
example.  In one's family line.  In the memories of others.  While I'm
not suggesting that you HAVE to call it "immortality" if I make a copy
of all the information stored in your body, I think you do have to
admit, it's the closest you'll ever be able to get.

This leads me to conclude that whether you believe that you are your
current body or not, your best chance at immortality in the material
world is the recording and storing of your body in a replicable form,
because your current body will die.

When we can figure out how to do this, we'll be right near
Singularity.

---------------

I've heard a number of different charts to a variety of different
things that might be called "Singularity."  There are large deviations
between them; one of the largest rifts is the divide between those who
think that we should build an AI to figure out how to do the relevant
recording, (or, to be more precise, build a seed AI and hope that it
performs the relevant recording), and those who think that we should
try to upload ourselves without help from AIs; that, if we do employ
AIs to help us, we should only use those AIs stupid enough to be
completely controlled by us and to serve our bidding unflinchingly.

(We might also try a little bit of simple biological enhancement to
hurry us along either path.)

Either route will require a lot of thought, and a lot of intelligence.
We have market mechanisms and governments to coordiate this work for
now; this might be sufficient to bring us a seed AI before we blow
ourselves up, if seed AIs are pretty easy, but it's not enough if seed
AIs are very hard.  Uploading is hard by everyone's estimates.

We'll get around to solving one or both of these problems eventually,
but as far as I'M concerned, this problem has a time limit.  If this
problem isn't solved within my lifetime, I have no use for the
solution.  If it isn't solved before we blow ourselves up, then it's
no use to anybody.

Other than biologically enhancing humans (non-PC, forbidden almost
everywhere), acquiring funding (either by performing useful work or by
begging for it, even begging the government), or actual lab work, what
more can be done to bring one of these two about SOON?

The answer is borganization, in which one or more intelligent people
get their heads together and think as a single entity of unified
intelligence.  (Some cybernetics are probably required, but certainly
not the clunky stuff you saw on Star Trek.)  The market and, to a
lesser extent, the government, is designed to coordinate our efforts
in this way, but it does so slowly and inefficiently.  Direct neural
inputs and outputs coupled with even a mechanism as simplistic as an
e-cash market would lead to thoughts and conclusions many times faster
than our society can output.  Everything would happen faster,
including our science.

If we're trying to build a seed, borganizing will get us there
faster.  If we're trying to upload, borganizing will get us THERE
faster, too.

Is borganizing easier (or faster) than simply uploading, or than
building a seed?  I very much think so in the case of uploading, and I
largely believe so in the case of building a seed.  Uploading already
looks like it will be too hard a project to win the race against my
death.  If it requires nanotech, then we risk that nanotech being
abused before it can be used effectively to upload me.  If uploading
does not require nanotech, then the sort of technologies which would
be required for borganization seem to me to be enabling technologies
for uploading.

As for building a seed, I happen to hold a fairly pessimistic view on
the question of how long it will take before we get our seed; I worry
that we won't get it before we blow ourselves up.  My pessimism aside,
it should also be noted that borganization, if not called
"borganization," is also a substantially lower future shock level than
seed AI, especially when you see it as a simple trend of accelerating
communications.  This is mostly based on hunches, which is why I
suggest that I only "largely believe" that borganizing will be easier
than building a seed.

So, right now, I think borganization is my very best chance to survive
the death of my body.  What do you think?

No.  Wish I had one for it.  I gather it's only available nonvirtually.

I think from what I could glean from Richard Schumaker's essay, Graves was
onto something with his view of Nietzsche.

Use of the present tense is not wrong in this context, but I won't argue
it.:)

This does not answer either question.  Why is Mohammed either?  What
characteristics do you see in him that lead you to believe he is/was a
"total man," an "enlightened master," or "fully awakened beyond words"?
(Whatever the last phrase means!)

> I put Mohammed in the same category with Buddha, Moses, Lao
> Tzu, Christ, Krishna, Socrates, and Kabir because all these were fully
awakened

I disagree that any on the list are "fully awakened beyond words," but I
chose to attack what I believe is the weakest link.  While I do agree
Mohammed founded a religion, I do not see that as all that enlightening or
as evidence of being a total man -- in the conventional sense of the word.
This is, at least, from my readings of the Koran and history.  (I'm sure
some will disagree here, but military conquest and the like do not seem like
traits of enlightenment to me.  Of course, in Nietzsche's sense, I can see
how he would see this as part of being a "total man," given his views of
natural virtues.  However, it is just in this point that I think we must
question Nietzsche.)

Now, if you mean by those terms, founders of new religions or of new
philosphical movements, then, yeah, they all seem to fit, though that's not
saying much.  Why not put the pre-Socratics in there too, and the guy who
founded Mormonism as well as Madame Blavatsky?  (Of course, perhaps you do,
since you had "et al." on your original list.)

I dunno, in advanced weaponry the human has to be removed from the
control loop, and be it simply because of the latency. Autonomous
systems capable of rapid reaction to complex stimuli are very possible
with the right neuronal hardware, and hence will dominate the future
largely automated battlefield.  Just give it some time, and a new
political polarization (Europa/Northern America/Asia would be good
candidates) as an incentive to start up the arms race again, and we're
almost there.

All the (threatened) AI has to do is to take over the existing
military and civil systems, which should be a cakewalk, given how
holey IT securety today is and in near/mid-term future will be. Of
course what makes the Terminator series so unrealistic is the temporal
scope of the conflict, and that there are still human survivors at
relatively late stage of the game. Considering existing overkill
capacities, in reality it would be over very quickly, even not
considering autoamplifying/self accelerating capacities of the AI in a
positive autofeedback loop.

I know a lot of mystically inclined people, and the overwhelming majority are
know-nothing zipperheads, and happy to stay that way. They find thinking
rationally, logically, to be too tiring for their poor little minds. They
prefer, as a famous wrestler has said, 'the crutch of religion.' Religion and
mysticism ARE the opiates of society, just as much as opiates are the religion
of society.

While studying mystical things can be interesting, and good study for someone
interested in stretching their mind, actually beleiving any of that nonsense is
the realm of simpletons.

I've found that by being nonjudgemental with people that almost everyone
I've ever discussed psychic experiences with has had some at some point
in their lives. In a recent encounter I mentioned this approach directly
and the person I was speaking with immediately began talking about his
own psychic experiences.

The experiences range from the trivial (e.g. seeing the same elderly
couple in crowds at different places and times) to the bizarre (an
hours-long tale of poltergeist experiences including exploding glassware
and visions of dead people). None of them were described as controllable
or repeatable.

Hah, I can top that- back in 1980, I was employee #2 at Otrona (Ron
Lingemann & I working in his basement workshop), and I wirewrapped the
prototype of the Attache portable computer.  This actually got to market
several months *before* the Osborne, but didn't have the marketing

(Otrona went belly up in 1984. Ancient history...)

 Spoken like a man who knows all without experiencing anything first hand.
It's good to know that rational inquiry can extend to the things that
Extropian dogma says are forbidden. ;-)

 In other words, you are parroting the dogma fed to you without verifying it
for yourself, aren't you? I assume that you haven't actually put in the actual
*work* (and it is work) to learn to meditate, for example, in a more than
simplistic fashion and found out if it is nonsense or not. Correct me if I'm
wrong.

 I know a hell of a lot more mystically inclined people than most of you, I
wager. While many are vapid (just as many people into transhumanism are vapid
escapists as well), plenty are not.

Ah, yes, 1980, a seminal year. I learned BASIC under John Fucci and John Kemeny
in night classes while in 7th grade, and wrote a football video game in BASIC on
the TI-99. The roulette and slot machine games made me some money, but got me in
trouble with the school administration... ;)  I wish I still had those program
printouts... I still have the BASIC text book..

Ah.  Unfortunately, it's pretty boring.

Timothy Leary.  Design for Dying.  Harper Collins, San Francisco,
1997.

p. 170:

--------

Uploading: Mind If I Slip Into Something More Incorruptible?

The most commonly discussed mode for postbiological living is the idea
of uploading, copying or otherwise somehow transferring, your brain
patterns and structures into a new format, probably a highly advanced
computer hybrid.

Hans Moravec is the most well known proponent of this future
technology.  In his book _Mind Children_, Moravec suggests a gradual
tranference of consciousness into steady state, neuron by neuron.
According to Extropian Eliezer Yudkowsky, this might be accomplished
by a process in which nanotechnological robots scan each of the
brain's neurons, placing a copy on the hard drive of the computer.

I believe there are lots of these phenomena that occur. Now the question is how useful are they? I reflect hat the recent development with FTL experiments were deemed repeatable, although insignificant, since the propagation of photons through cesium atoms create the illusion of FTL-apparent FTL. Is "psychic" phenomena merely the "presistent" illusion of the human species? I recall that Hans Morevec speculated that perhaps, consciousness does not end at physical death, but instead transfers to the next "universe" where it can survive? Perhaps as a intereference pattern in a purely psychological universe? Oh well lunch is over, back to work.

Amidst all these ideas for T-shirts (and coffee cups and mouse pads, etc.), 
I'd like to suggest that someone help us create a marketplace at 
www.extropy.org for advertising and selling them. The idea would be that 
anyone can come up with a design, after a quick review of the design it can 
be advertised on a section of the site, and the profits can be split in 
some equitable way between the designer and ExI.

This would concentrate the ideas and create a place where people regularly 
look for such items. More ideas would be implemented, more memes would be 
spread, and at least small amounts of life-giving cash would flow into the 
hands of meme-makers and ExI. (I have a few ideas of my own for T-shirts 
and I bet Natasha could produce numerous great designs for everything from 
T-shirts to posters if so inclined.)

I don't have time to run this marketplace, but I see no problem with 
rewarding whoever does run it with part of ExI's percentage. (On items like 
posters or other things more pricey than T-shirts and mugs the amounts 
could get interestings--especially if we can increase traffic to our 
current two web sites, and the third one I'm planning.)

Another part of the marketplace might be modelled on The Motley Fool's 
Soapbox (www.soapbox.com) or Multex Investor, where individuals can sell 
their own research reports. If anyone is interested in helping develop 
these ideas, please let me know on-list or off-list.

Onward!

What, are you kidding?  It barely takes five minutes to learn to meditate
perfectly.

Don't tell me you've been doing it the slow way?

Now, if you mean by those terms, founders of new religions or of new
philosphical movements, then, yeah, they all seem to fit, though that's not
saying much.  Why not put the pre-Socratics in there too, and the guy who
founded Mormonism as well as Madame Blavatsky?  (Of course, perhaps you do,
since you had "et al." on your original list.)

Don't forget our fave sci-fi writer, mr Hubbard.

I am of the opinion (right now, at half past four in the morning) that the
only way transhumanism (or more likely extropianism) will make it into the
mainstream is by turning itself into a religion,  or something equally
dogmatic. I guess it could turn into a sport. So who's our Allmensch?

LOS NINOS MAY BE GONE, BUT PESKY PACIFIC PATTERN REMAINS

     After three years of El Nino and La Nina with their often devastating 
climate consequences, the Pacific is finally calming down in the tropics 
but still shows signs of being abnormal elsewhere, according to the latest 
satellite data from the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission.

     These data, taken during a 10-day cycle of collection ending August 17,

show that tropical Pacific sea levels, which indicate how much heat is 
stored in the ocean, have returned to near-normal (green) after three years 
of dramatic fluctuations. See http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino/ .

     But as summer ends in the Northern Hemisphere, remnants of the past few

years remain embedded in the upper ocean.  Above-normal sea surface heights 
and warmer ocean temperatures (indicated by the red and white areas) still 
blanket the far-western tropical Pacific and much of the north (and south) 
mid-Pacific.  Red areas are about 10 centimeters (4 inches) above normal; 
white areas show the sea surface height is between 14 and 32 centimeters (6 
to 13 inches) above normal.  This contrasts with the Bering Sea and Gulf of 
Alaska where lower-than-normal sea levels and cool ocean temperatures 
continue (indicated by blue areas), although this pattern is also 
weakening. The blue areas are between 5 and 13 centimeters (2 and 5 inches) 
below normal, whereas the purple areas range from 14 to18 centimeters (6 to 
7 inches) below normal.

     Looking at the entire Pacific basin, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation's 
(PDO) characteristic warm horseshoe and cool wedge pattern is still evident 
in this sea-level height image. The PDO is a long-term ocean temperature 
fluctuation of the Pacific Ocean that waxes and wanes approximately every 
10 to 20 years. Most recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) sea-surface temperature date also clearly illustrate the persistence 
of this basin-wide pattern. They are available at:
http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/PSB/EPS/SST/climo.html .

     "The present calming started three to four months ago when the La 
Nina faded away," said oceanographer Dr. William Patzert of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  "It appears that the global 
climate system is finally recovering from the past three years of dramatic 
swings from the extra-large El Nino of 1997/1998, which was followed by two 
unusually cool and persistent La Nina years."

     "The good news is that we're finally out from under the El Nino and La
Nina 
of the past three years," Patzert said. "Unfortunately, in the longer term, 
the reality is that the PDO pattern still dominates the Pacific and, in the 
short term, the atmosphere is still acting as though La Nina remains. The 
western United States continues hot and dry, and a larger than normal 
number of hurricanes are forecast by NOAA for both the Pacific and the 
Atlantic. Also for the remainder of the summer and into the fall, we are 
continuing to experience the legacy or hangover from El Nino and La Nina -- 
the devastating Western U.S. fires from the Canadian to Mexican borders are 
one example."

     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National
Weather 
Service has forecasted continuing heat in the Western United States and an 
active hurricane season for the end of summer and into the fall. NOAA 
seasonal forecasts can be found at: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov and 
http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov .

     This month marks the eighth anniversary of the launch of
TOPEX/Poseidon, a 
mission that had been planned to last only three to five years. The 
satellite has orbited Earth more than 37,400 times and completed 290 10-day 
data collection cycles. More than 99 percent of all available mission data 
has been collected and archived by the operations team at JPL.

     The U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission is managed by JPL for NASA's
Earth 
Science Enterprise, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a division of the California 
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

Now, that is a personal attack.

There is a time for rational inquiry, and a time to come to conclusions about
that which has been inquired into. Most all mysticism passed the second stage
long ago.

Actually, I've learned hypnosis, and done quite a bit of meditation, neither of
which are in and of themselves 'mysticism'. I've studied yoga, buddhism, lots of
different mythologies and new age kludges, along with various alternative
medical theories. While it is interesting stuff, it is also mostly bunk.

Oh boy, now its a pissing contest. Frankly, most of the people I know in
transhumanism are most definitely NOT vapid escapists, extropians in particular.
If Exi were more into vapid escapism I'm sure they'd have a far larger
following, even just in California.

It's still nice to know.  I have now officially been in books, plural.

There is a decent shopping cart script you can use that is at
http://www.htmlgoodies.com
They provide easy to follow directions, etc. Selena Sol's Extropia Software site
also has a good shopping cart script package, though they charge for it (I don't
know how closely they are actually tied to Exi). You can also try Everysoft,
which has a decent auction script and other scripts available. The auction
script can do dutch, multiple item, and other auction features typically seen on
ebay.

 I'm sure that the science fiction reading Extropians that I've been running
into since college in 1992 who are waiting for that ideal future after the
singularity when they can upload their minds and create their own personal
universes are not escapists. The fact that most of them that I've known don't
do anything towards this end, hold dead-end jobs and play lots of Dungeons and
Dragons isn't terribly telling, right?

 The dream world that some have painted for life after the mythical
singularity bears an amazing resemblance to the religious doctrine of some
faiths.

As an enlightened master, Mohammed's intent was to help others to attain
enlightenment. Founding a religion has nothing to do with it, and may in fact
inhibit the movement toward enlightenment. Kabir (also on the list) definitely
did not found a religion. Nevertheless, his poetry remains enlightening.

Although insightful and spiritually iconoclastic, Nietzsche was not enlightened.

Founding a religion most definitely does not constitute enlightenment. If you
really want to know about enlightenment, then you will meditate whenever you
can, for as long as you can, so that you can attain enlightenment. Then you will
know for yourself. Expressing opinions and exchanging speculation about
enlightenment are ways of postponing your own enlightenment.
You can call it enlightenment or nirvana or total awareness or self realization
or self actualization or cosmic consciousness or the crystallization of man's
harmonious development or samadhi or satori or choiceless awareness or
superconsciousness or the psychedelic experience or transcendence or the
beatitude or zen or dhyana or the peak of human experience or hypercognition or
any of the other ninety nine names of nothingness. My personal favorite is
superlative sentience. It simply means the direct experience of reality.

Which extropians are these exactly?  The telling difference between those 'D&D
playing' extropians (none that I know over age 16) and the vapid escapists are
that extropes know such things are fantasy, while the vapid escapists that are
into mysticism think that that is the real world. There is a significant
difference between the two.

Most extropes I know do work toward many of the goals of extropians, though
typically those which interest them the most. The artists do art, the engineers
do things like design and build rockets, the medical people research longevity,
intelligence, and cryonics, the computer people work on computers.

Take ANY extropian I know, and they have far more on the ball than any non
extrope I know, on average, and vastly more than any mystic I know, who
typically are still playing with crystals into middle age.

Yes indeed, extropy does involve some of the cache of faith. It includes a
concept that E. O. Wilson has called "exemptionalism."
"In this conception, our species exists apart from the natural world and holds
dominion over it. We are exempt from the iron laws of ecology that bind other
species. Few limits on human expansion exist that our special status and
ingenuity cannot overcome. we have been set free to modify Earth's surface to
create a world better than the one our ancestors knew.
"For the committed exemptionalist, Homo sapiens has in effect become a new
species... "
--E. O. Wilson, _Consilience_, p.278

Perhaps this happens because of the Western civ heritage of extropians. Anyway,
extropy and life itself have parallel trajectories. I look forward to a
Singularity which answers human questions and solves human problems.

Keep smiling,

 Since college? Built a career in the tech industry, got married, had a kid,
and amassed a decent amount in stock options. I'm certainly not waiting for
the singularity or the messiah to get on with my life though.

Thanks for letting us know in advance - I'll try and pick up a copy
tomorrow (will this be available in the online edition at
http://www.faz.com/, as well?). And congratulations that you made it
into the most important German daily newspaper.

It's the Singularity, run for yer lives!! The skull is, above all, a great 
attention grabber. Whether or not people will associate it with "danger, 
avoid this" when it's *on a T-shirt* depends largely on the rest of your 
lay-out (and on how the wearer looks, of course). IMO, anyway. And then 
there's also the fact that plenty of people have a morbid fascination for 
skulls and related stuff, so it would be something like "Hey check it out, 
a skull! Cool! Huhhuhuh!" rather than "avoid this; avoid this URGENTLY."

>You don't want to communicate the notion that "those who view this

That's right. It *is* a call to action, though. "Danger, get organized now 
or DIE".

You could try something with the extinction theme; for example, have a 
T-shirt with some well-known species of dinosaur and the text "Hodie mihi, 
cras tibi". Then below that, or on the other side: "Singularity is coming, 
no flesh shall be spared!", and/or Vinge's quote.

There is, on the cover of some SF book I once saw (something by Heinlein, 
perhaps?) a picture of a robot who's about to throw an astronaut from a 
mountain (he holds the struggling figure high above his head). Very 
powerful, could be used for an anti-AI T-shirt.

Or, on a more positive note, just TECHNOLOGY WILL SET YOU FREE, and then 
the URL of your choice. Simple, mildly enigmatic and (presumably) 
effective. An alternative version could feature an uplifting transhuman 
graphic, for example Natasha's _DNA breakout_.

And have you made your mark upon the world?  Done anything, anything at all,
to make the world a better place for everyone, not just yourself or your
immediate circle?

Speaking as a Research Fellow of the Singularity Institute, and one whose life
is devoted to creating the Singularity today-not-tomorrow, it always strikes
me as unimaginably preposterous when people react to the concept of the
Singularity by thinking that they've got it made and all they need to do is
wait - but your own attitude is even worse.  Best of all is to try to achieve
your dreams, but even fatalistic and useless dreams are better than no dreams
at all.  They can be kicked awake if their dream is threatened.  You're dead
to the world.

 There is no point in talking about my work towards my dreams. It would be
dismissed as mystical rubbish by the masses here. The reason that I never
joined ExI years ago still stands and that is the dogmatic embrace of atheism
and the ridicule of any sense of spirituality in others by its members.

 I am well aware of current scientific research in a number of fields. I read
far and wide. I work in the computer industry and keep up on the technical
aspect of things. I study philosophy, especially classical. I am not some
unthinking airhead but any admittance of spirituality will immediately have me
lumped in with the most idiotic of creationists. Dogma, in anyone, is silly.

Tell us something that everyone else has not been doing. Thats a rather generic
list you give.

What have you DONE with your life, and if you think extropy is a bunch of hooey,
what are you DOING here? What do you hope to accomplish? What are your goals?

 I think dogmatic extropianism is a bunch of hooey. I think transhumanism is a
workable philosophy. There is a distinction between the two.

 Sure there is. So? You know the exact nature of it in all of its details? You
know everything there is to know about how the human mind works? The human
body? The nature of consciousness?

 When do you get your Nobel Prize, Eli? I want to see you collect it since you
know all of these things.

Al, a lot of the kiddies who played D&D in decades past have gone on to code 
fansty games and such. Nintendo has come out with its latest, flavor, and 
Bill Gates has developed his X-Box for the public. The gameheads have a 
decent future and are no worse off then sports fans, who devote income, and 
time in the following of professional athletics. Who is wasting their time?

Thanks, EvMick, for the info. I was wondering what was supposedly going
on with this, having heard a report on on local CBC radio here in
Saskatchewan, Canada. I'd note that if you follow up on the New York
Times website, with a free account and searching for things like "north
pole ice melt" you come up with a the seemingly very definite result
that the Arctic ice pack has been reduced by 6%, just since 1978. At the
same time, sea level is said to have been affected very little, owing to
the fact that the reduced volume of sea ice changes total water volume
very little, while land pack ice (Greenland, Antarctica) hasn't been
reduced.

All of which seems a little confusing to me -- or to put it another way,
I am not reassured that the "stop global warming" people really know
what they are talking about yet. I mean, open water in the Arctic summer
is not all that remarkable, it seems. At the same time, I have to worry
that a 6% reduction in the ice pack overall now looks like a smoking gun
for manmade global warming? Such a noticeable amount of melting on a
large scale, and in only 22 years; this is more impressive than past
computer projections of a couple of degrees warming in a century! Or, is
it just the El Nino/La Nina ocean current changes messing with the ice
in a way that has little to do with the overall world's temperature as
such?

I am strongly tempted to say that the world should just *wait* on this
problem *another* 22 years, to confirm if the actual overall world
temperature is going up or not and also to confirm (as much as it can be
confirmed) whether fossil fuel use is the most likely cause. At that
point, if the *global* quality of any warming is confirmed, put a high
priority on developing nano-engineered trucks, tractors, buses, etc.,
that don't burn fossil fuels. For nano to get to the point of being a
big help, this time frame seems about right -- or am I just
oversimplifying, stalling, the enviros have it right, so that we really
gotta *move* on this or *fry*, etc?

I think this sort of belief might be the dogma to which Al refers.


You will grant, I hope, that there are plenty of smart, rational beings who
do not hold the above belief?


I read the Extropian Principles for the first time today and would like to
include this fine passage:


"We accept no final intellectual authorities. No individual, no institution,
no book, and no single principle can serve as the source or standard of
truth. All beliefs are fallible and must be open to testing and challenging.
We do not accept revelation, authority, or emotion as reliable sources of
knowledge. We place little weight on claims that cannot be checked."



I think it's a little early in the game to be making authoritative
statements as to the true nature/s of the substrate into which our existence
is written.  It is an idea towards which our current sensory abilities can
but point.

The correct wording could be that uploading fills a NEED that bears an 
amazing resemblance to the NEED that religious doctines address: Immortality. 
HOW  Spiritualists and Singularists percieve this endless life is QUITE  
different, though both require a lot of imagination and waiting.  

Maybe think of it as
'life after death' vs. 'life life life life...'

First Queenely admonition, memoria: It's not good to badger Extropians in 
list forum. Some things are not negotiable. Cut it out. You're gonna waste MY 
bandwidth on the resulting flames.

Here is an article that focuses on theorist, Seth Lloyd. A goodie article for 
Omega Pointers, and Singularity Mavens.

                               The Last Computer
One day you'll be sitting in front of a searing-hot nuclear fireball instead 
of that inert grey box, says Marcus Chown 


SETH LLOYD has seen the future of computing, and it's bright. Blindingly 
bright. For, according to Lloyd, the ultimate computer will be nothing like 
an IBM ThinkPad and everything like a "billion-degree piece of the big bang". 

Before you dismiss the idea, just consider the awesome power you would have 
at your disposal. According to Lloyd's calculations, the ultimate laptop 
could solve in less than a nano-second a calculation that would take any 
state-of-the-art computer the age of the Universe to complete. 

Admittedly, it might be a bit inconvenient putting a nuclear fireball on your 
desk. But that is only the most ordinary, conventional kind of ultimate 
computer--the alternative could be something stranger still. 

The train of thought that led to these bizarre physical extremes started from 
a simple observation. Gordon Moore, a co-founder of the computer chip maker 
Intel, noticed in 1965 that the number of transistors per square inch on 
chips had doubled every 18 months or so since the integrated circuit was 
invented. This trend has continued. Experts are divided over how much longer 
the law will hold, but Lloyd for one is fed up with people constantly writing 
it off. "People have been claiming the law is about to break down every 
decade since it was formulated," says Lloyd, a physicist based at MIT. "But 
they've all been wrong. I thought, let's see where Moore's law has to stop 
and can go no further. Let's find the limits that no amount of human 
ingenuity will ever be able to get around." 

To begin with, he wasn't too concerned with the details of how the ultimate 
computer might work--those can be sorted out by the engineers of the future. 
Instead, he stuck to considering basic physical quantities such as energy, 
volume and temperature (Nature, vol 406, p 1047). 

The speed of a computer, Lloyd realised, is limited by the total energy 
available to it. The argument for this is rather subtle. A computer performs 
a logical operation by flipping a "0" to a "1" or vice versa. But there is a 
limit to how fast this can be done because of the need to change a physical 
state representing a "0" to a state representing a "1". In the quantum world 
any object, including a computer, is simply a packet of waves of various 
frequencies all superimposed. Frequency is linked to energy by Planck's 
constant, so if the wave packet has a wide range of energies, it is made up 
of a large range of different frequencies. As these waves interfere with one 
another, the overall amplitude can change very fast. On the other hand, a 
small energy spread means a narrow range of frequencies, and much slower 
changes in state. 

Because a computer can't contain negative energies, the spread in energy of a 
bit cannot be greater than its total energy. In 1998, Norman Margolus and Lev 
Levitin of MIT calculated that the minimum time for a bit to flip is Planck's 
constant divided by four times the energy. 

Lloyd has built on Margolus's work by considering a hypothetical 1-kilogram 
laptop. Then the maximum energy available is a quantity famously given by the 
formula E = mc2. "If this mass-energy were turned into a form such as radiant 
energy, you'd have 1017 joules in photons," says Lloyd. "And, if you put all 
this energy in a single bit, it could flip in 10-51 seconds." But quantum 
physicists believe the shortest possible time for any event to occur is the 
"Planck time" of 10-43 seconds. "Something is screwy," says Lloyd. 

In practice, computers do not have a single bit of memory but lots of bits. 
If the energy of the 1-kilogram laptop were spread among more than a billion 
bits, each would flip more slowly than the Planck time. "Although each bit 
would flip more slowly, there would be more of them," says Lloyd, "so the 
total number of bit-flips per second would be the same." 

So the ultimate laptop, one that has converted all its mass-energy to 
radiation, would be able to carry out a mind-boggling 1051 operations per 
second. Compare this with today's standard laptop, which has a clock speed of 
about 500 megahertz and carries out up to 1000 parallel operations each 
cycle--a total of about 1012 operations per second. The ultimate laptop would 
be 1039 times faster. If even that is too slow for you, you can add more 
mass--a 1000-kilogram computer would be a thousand times faster, for example. 
What's more, says Lloyd, the ultimate laptop would be a quantum computer, 
able to exploit an unimaginable number of superimposed states, solving 
certain kinds of problem (such as factorising large numbers) far faster than 
a classical computer.

Why then are today's laptops so damned slow? The simple answer, says Lloyd, 
is they use only the electromagnetic energy of electrons moving through 
transistors, and this energy is dwarfed by the energy locked away in the mass 
of the computer, which provides nothing more than the scaffolding to keep a 
computer stable. The ultimate laptop would have all of its available energy 
in processing interactions and none of its energy in dumb mass. 

With that sort of computing power, astrophysicists could simulate the whole 
Universe on the scale of stars, and physicists could simulate a large lump of 
matter on the scale of individual atoms--and just think of the possibilities 
for realistic computer games. 

So much for speed. What limits memory? The short answer is entropy. This is 
the degree of disorder, or randomness, in a system. Entropy is intimately 
connected to information, because information needs disorder: a smooth, 
ordered system has almost no information content. 

State limits 

Entropy is linked to the number of distinguishable states a system can have 
by the equation inscribed on Boltzmann's headstone S = k ln W. Entropy (S) is 
the natural logarithm of the number of states (W) multiplied by Boltzmann's 
constant (k). Equally, to store a lot of information, you need a lot of 
distinguishable states. To register one bit of information, you need two 
states, one representing "on", the other "off". Similarly, 2 bits require 4 
states, 3 bits 8 states, and so on. In short, both the entropy of a system 
and its information content are proportional to the logarithm of the number 
of states. "The answer to the question--what is the maximum memory of a 
computer?--can actually be found on Boltzmann's headstone," says Lloyd. 

So how much entropy does one of Lloyd's computers have? It depends on the 
volume of the computer, as well as its energy. Broadly speaking, the more 
volume, the more possible positions of particles in the computer, so the more 
available states. For his ultimate laptop, Lloyd picked a convenient 1-litre 
size. 

The exact calculation also depends on how many different kinds of particle 
are knocking around inside the computer. "If all the mass-energy of the 
computer is used, we're talking about converting it into light," he says. "So 
what we need to calculate is the number of distinguishable states available 
to a box of light--this is a calculation carried out by Max Planck for a 
so-called black body a century ago." 

It turns out that a litre of light could store about 1031 bits, 1020 times as 
much as a modern 10-gigabyte hard drive. Today's laptops store so little 
information, says Lloyd, because they store it in an extremely redundant 
fashion. A single bit on your hard drive is stored by a "magnetic domain" 
which may contain millions of atoms. 

All in all, the ultimate laptop would look pretty weird. With all that 
radiant energy squeezed into such a small space, it would be fantastically 
hot, around a billion degrees. The "light" would actually be high-energy 
gamma-ray photons. "Controlling all that energy--that's the challenge," says 
Lloyd. 

Assuming we could contain this sizzling soup, it might work something like 
this. Information would be stored in the positions and trajectories of 
gamma-ray photons, and processed by collisions between these photons and the 
few electrons and positrons also floating around.

Readout would be easy. "You simply open up a hole in the side of the box," 
says Lloyd. "The photons come out at the speed of light, and you record the 
sequence of clicks on a gamma-ray detector." Input would require some sort of 
controlled gamma-ray generator. Of course, all these accessories would take 
useful mass-energy away from the central processor, but Lloyd assumes it will 
eventually be possible to make them very small and light. 

But whatever cunning technology is used for input and output, this version of 
the ultimate laptop has a serious design flaw. Information can't be moved in 
and out of the computer faster than light, so assuming that the 1-litre 
laptop is a cube with 10-centimetre sides, all of its 1031 or so bits of 
memory could be dumped in the time taken for light to travel 10 
centimetres--3 10-10 seconds. 

That gives a data transfer rate of nearly 1041 bits per second. But 
potentially, the computer can perform a total of 1051 operations in that 
second. The same goes for any substantial chunk of the computer--it can do 
far more calculations than it can communicate to other parts of the computer. 
So each subsection would have to work independently. "This is a highly 
parallel machine," says Lloyd. 

And this information bottleneck has serious implications for error 
correction. Error-correcting codes check computer calculations to find out 
whether something's gone wrong. But in the ultimate laptop, any erroneous 
bits would have to be physically taken out of the computer, radiated away and 
replaced by new bits. This version of the ultimate laptop can discard no more 
than 1041 errors while it makes 1051 calculations, so it can tolerate only 
one error for every ten billion operations. If that accuracy can't be 
achieved, the 1-litre laptop would have to operate at below the ultimate 
speed limit. 

So is there any way to increase the input/output rate? "Yes," says Lloyd. 
"Make the laptop smaller." If the size is reduced it takes less time for 
information to move around, and there is less memory to be moved, so the 
computer becomes more serial. In general, serial calculations are more 
versatile, because highly parallel computers only work if the input and 
output are brief, containing far less information than the total amount 
processed in the course of the calculation. 

The 1-litre ultimate laptop is already at about a billion degrees. But as it 
is compressed the temperature rises and other, more exotic, particles can be 
conjured into existence. "Computers of the future may be high-power 
relativistic devices similar to particle accelerators," says Walter Simmons 
of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Simmons and his colleagues Sandip 
Pakvasa and Xerxes Tata have explored the far future of so-called 
relativistic computing, involving interactions between known physical 
particles. But they have not pursued that future to the giddy limits 
envisaged by Lloyd. "As the temperature rises and ever-more exotic particles 
can be created, our knowledge of the physics gets shakier and shakier," he 
says. Fortunately, though, there comes a time when the physics becomes simple 
again. 

If you keep squashing the computer, eventually it will turn into a black 
hole. The whole mass of the 1-kilogram laptop would then be squeezed into a 
volume little more than 10-27 metres across. How can this still be a 
computer? 

Stephen Hawking of the University of Cambridge theorised in 1970 that a black 
hole should evaporate, emitting light and elementary particles from its 
horizon, the surface that marks the point of no return for objects falling 
in. Thermodynamics says that any radiating body has entropy, and in 1972 
Jacob Bekenstein calculated how much a black hole must have. If we equate 
entropy with information, this means that a 1-kilogram black hole can store 
around 1016 bits. 

According to conventional physics, as espoused by Hawking among others, any 
information that goes into a black hole is lost to the rest of the Universe. 
That would rule out using a black hole as a computer. But string theorists 
think otherwise. "Hawking raised an important question," says Gordon Kane of 
the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. "But there is evidence that string 
theory will show that something happens to preserve the information." Lloyd 
believes that information about how a black hole was formed may be written on 
the horizon, perhaps in the form of impressed strings, like flattened 
spaghetti. 

Because of this, Lloyd thinks it could be possible to use a black hole as the 
ultimate computer. At this black hole limit, it turns out that the time 
required to communicate around the hole is exactly the same as the time 
needed to flip each bit. "In other words, the black-hole computer is the 
ultimate serial computer," says Lloyd. He believes that this apparent 
coincidence hints at another deep link between physics and information. 

Ideas for how this black-hole computer would process information are even 
vaguer than for the box of gamma rays. The input would be the initial state 
of the material, the program would be how that material is forced to collapse 
into a black hole. The output would be somehow encoded in the Hawking 
radiation, emitted in a rapid blast as the hole evaporates. This is a one-off 
computer, exploding with the answer to its calculation. 

So here is where Moore's law must end, with a billion-degree laptop or an 
exploding submicroscopic black hole. "The truth is we have no notion of how 
to attain these ultimate limits," admits Lloyd. But don't despair--put your 
faith in human ingenuity. If the rate of progress doesn't slow, we'll reach 
these ultimate physical limits in just two hundred years' time.

Hi extropians,

A lot of "scientific" sorts base their outlook on a nineteenth century
conceptual Universe.

By the late '20s,  of this century, Quantum Theory had introduced serious
grounds for the legitimization of mysticism in physics - and by the time Von
Neumann & Wigner finished with it, even frank spirituality.

Parallel with that, Church; Godel; Post & Turing certainly formulated
rigorous ideas on computability that allowed (...even encouraged, some
say...) mysticism in our logic & epistemology.

It is perhaps unscientific (...in a 21st century sense...) to dismiss all
mystics as Know Nothings.

I've known of mystical rabbis with Ph. Ds in theoretical physics and I've
met vedantic philosophers whose grasp of modern physics was breathtaking.

There's a lot of "feel-good" non-reasoning behind some New Age stuff - but
you can't dismiss the lot unless you've read them or engaged them in
meaningful dialogue.

I have. Not enough, I'm sure.

But there's a hell of a lot of orthodox scientific bigotry going on here.
Natural, to be sure, in a Kuhnian sense... but to be kept in rein - if we
want to be good extropians.

This is not relevant.

Just because one does not know the answer does not mean that one must
exhaustively examine the space of all possible idiotic assertions for the
answer.  All hypotheses are not equal.

This isn't dogmatic.  Rather, it is the efficient use of finite resources.
If you have useful theories with regard to the questions above, let them
be examined on their own merits.  Just don't bring any sacred cows to the
party, because they are as likely as not to be slaughtered.

 Spirituality doesn't necessarily have anything to do with life after death.
Not all spirituality is based on Christianity if that needs to be pointed out.

If your dreams are comprised of creative ideas or circumstances I don't
know why they would be dismissed.  If your dreams are religious and
desirous of some of the teachings of religious beliefs, there are probably
better formats to discuss them.  However, dreams are the fruits of thought
and it's probably not a good idea to give our minds hard and fast rules on
what to dream about -:)   I enjoy draming about the Creativity Augmentum
when anything considered "state-of-the-art" will be in demand and aesthetic
contributions to the future considered to be the alpha-of-thinking.

>The reason that I never

>and the ridicule of any sense of spirituality in others by its members.

I think your statement is broad and sweeping.  Approximately one year ago
that I started a thread on this list titled something to the effect of "Is
There A Need for Transhuman Spirituality."  In this post I discussed at
length why I considered to be a need for refined emotions and how we can
develop and apply our current consciousness to the logical outgrowths of
the current and future trends of superintelligence.

Spirituality does not pertain exclusively to the concept of a human soul or
supernatural.  It can and does pertain to a sense of life.  One's spirit is
the vital animating force of one's being and associated with one's mind.
Kindness is often associated with being spiritual, while not necessarily
mystical or religious.  

I do not have an affinity for a human soul.  I do not have a mystical
sensibility.  I do have a sense of my own being and consciousness and a
desire to find peace of mind within my own mind and in all aspects of my
life around me.  Thus, I think you are inaccurate in claiming that a
member, such as myself, as adverse to spirituality, unless you are
exclusively referring to narrow, dogmatic concepts.

Further, I do not deny the existence of any of the many Gods that are
purported to exist simultaneously.  I do not believe in any one God nor do
I have an affinity to the sanctimonious followings of many religious
ceremonies, but certainly respect diversity.

>Dogma, in anyone, is silly.

Okay,

Masses? Yikes... whodat? ...me... ? 

Not every member here is against spiritual people. While I don't believe in 
angels or the tooth fairy, I look after my spiritual side -- quietly, calmly 
and without need of approval by anyone here. I understand why a religious 
person could feel ganged up on here, but you are making a generalization 
about  this consituency that is harmful and not entirely true.

Spirituality is meaningful to *me* - but we can have our own definitions of 
what that means. That doesn't mean there's a magical force of some kind that 
listens to my prayers or that I believe in life after death if I am just good 
enough to qualify. It also doesn't mean I believe that a giant turtle is 
carrying the earth on it's back! It means I take care to listen to the inner 
voice that guides me, and to keep open loving thoughts and people around me, 
do yoga, burn sage, sing rituals -- and find ways to balance and center me in 
this crazy world. I am not afraid these rough natured atheist grumps will 
ridicule or dismiss me!

boo hoo


True spirituality is unlike YOUR brand of it, whatever that is, it doesn't 
require atheists to censor their own dislike of 'spiritual people'.  In fact 
I welcome scepticism, ITS NOT DOGMA - and it keeps me above board and honest! 
If I'm foolin' myself, I wanna know!

Likewise, is not a threat to me if Mystic Bob KNOWs that turtle is there! 

Who cares if my rituals for self improvement are total crap! Feels good, I 
dig it, it's all in the *intent*  - hey, I paint a hell of a lot better when 
I do it... 

PS: Besides the mostly atheist crowd, there are pagans here, Mormons, 
"uncertain deists", Jews, Buddhists, Wicca, you name it. Probably some things 
that are just made up for fun! Computerotimists!
Life should be fun.

Take a chill pill, cool yer jets and stop making generalizations.  And one 
more question: are you picking on Eliezer?

What began all this was one very intelligent poster who expressed his 
commonly shared skeptics view of debunkery. 

Here's a spiritual exercise : ) 

 Look in the mirror and repeat: It all begins with ME, it all begins with 
me...

  i thought of sending something to this, then it occurred to me, 50,000 
years from now, will they even understand us?
Just think of how far humanity has come in 1,000 years, and then realize 
the growth is exponential. (on second thought, this is preaching to the 
choir, you all know this stuff) Things like "will they even remember where 
the hell Earth is in 50,000 years? (personally, people still using this 
planet as the main base of humanities operations in 50,000 years is rather 
depressing, we'd better have a Dyson shell built, or have a pure 
Singularity by then, or i'll be very disappointed ;)

Yep, and it's already on one: see

 A lot of "scientific" sorts base their outlook on a nineteenth century

 By the late '20s,  of this century, Quantum Theory had introduced serious
 grounds for the legitimization of mysticism in physics - and by the time Von
 Neumann & Wigner finished with it, even frank spirituality.
 
 Parallel with that, Church; Godel; Post & Turing certainly formulated
 rigorous ideas on computability that allowed (...even encouraged, some
 say...) mysticism in our logic & epistemology.
 
 It is perhaps unscientific (...in a 21st century sense...) to dismiss all
 mystics as Know Nothings.
 
 I've known of mystical rabbis with Ph. Ds in theoretical physics and I've
 met vedantic philosophers whose grasp of modern physics was breathtaking.
 
 There's a lot of "feel-good" non-reasoning behind some New Age stuff - but
 you can't dismiss the lot unless you've read them or engaged them in

 I have. Not enough, I'm sure.

I guess from the start of recorded history to date.........

The Neanderthals & homo erectus clearly lived in a *pre-human era*.

Some "primitive" tribes, although homo sapiens, seem to be living in a
different psychological state to modern people, which Jung compares
with what we might now call "schizophrenia"
(cite aboriginal dreamtime) in which "animism" and communication with
spirits is a constant and real experience. Such tribes which had no concept
of
"human" could also be said to be pre-human.

The post-human period starts with median vision theory (MVT) and the
solution of the "hard problem" in western philosophy, and the resulting
transparency through understanding of modern self-referential consciousness,
and is a state of mind rather than any technological improvement (these are
incremental and have been going on throughout human history).

"How to become post-human" instructions and links to MVT info can be found

Well, yes, you were.  You said that the Singularity is pie-in-the-sky,
invented by the evil Extropian dogmatists to keep themselves complacent. 
This, with respect to the field I've chosen to spend my entire life pursuing.

Now, the correct thing to do would have been to say:  "Wow, you mean there are
people actually working specifically towards the Singularity?  Sorry, I didn't
know."

I know enough about intelligence to take a shot at building one from scratch. 
I don't know everything, just as a modern-day physicist doesn't know
everything about physics.  That is utterly irrelevant when it comes to making
firm judgements with respect to the things I do know about, which includes a
lot of territory commonly regarded as ineffable.

They don't give out Nobel Prizes for cognitive science.  If they did, there'd
be nothing particularly implausible about the prospect of my winning one.

This is not a belief. It is a definition.
Reality means the fact, state, or quality of being real or genuine. 2. That
which is real; an actual thing, situation, or event. 3. The sum or totality of
real things. 4. That which exists, as contrasted with what is fictitious or
merely conceived of.

To make reality plural is simply to play with words. What shall we call the sum
of all "realities"? If you like, you can call it existence. There is only one
reality because reality means everything (and every non-thing) that actually
exists.

Okay, thank you for the clarification, Steve. So, in answer to you question, No,
enlightened masters do not hold us back in the human era. They allow us to
transcend our animal instincts to reach our full potential.

Nothing is true by definition.  Even so, it's very hard to imagine any
conceivable set of truths that would cause someone to say "There exist three
different realities" without being met with the response:  "Well, then, the
reality is that there are three different realities."

Irrelevant, anyhow, since the basic point is that having a plurality of
mutually exclusive opinions, and an early-21st-century Western social
convention about pretending to respect all of them, does not change the fact
that at most one opinion can be correct.

Hardly a sacred cow, and an arguable topic that has been debated on this
list in the past.  Check the archives if you want some background. 
Personal beliefs on singularities (not even necessarily "The Singularity")
vary widely on this list, as is evidenced in the list archives.

Come to think of it, *very* few things seem to be universal among
extropians; there has been open contention on just about every issue I can
think of.

Just because they didn't expound on them in the paper doesn't mean they are 
not aware of, and influenced by, his ideas in that regard.  I'd be very 
surprised if the drafters of that document are not familiar with the terms 
"gray goo" and "active shield."  Frankly, I'd be very surprised if the wonks 
and pols were publicly talking about such topics at this stage of the game.

This is a fine bit of tautology, signifying nothing.  If I grant your
definition of reality (as inclusive of "all things") then the term contains
no information.  Eliezer's statement may as well have read: "There is only
one everything."  One everything?  You can't apply useful modifiers to a
such a concept.

Instead I believe that many intelligent people use the term 'reality' to
refer to something distinct-- a true state of being that is seperate from
our perception of it.  This is a concept that I refer to as "worshipping
reality" and I think it contains many of the same belief elements as
organized religions.  It is a belief in something of which we do not have
direct experience.

I'm just running out the door, so I can't really address this right now, but
I'm certain you'll agree there is value in making the distinction between
reality and our perception of it.

Computer makes robot offspring
By MATTHEW FORDAHL-- The Associated Press

"
A computer programmed to follow the rules of evolution
has for the first time designed and manufactured
simple robots with minimal help from people. 
...
The computer that evolved the designs was told only
what parts it would be working with, that its goal was
locomotion and the physics of the environment in which
its offspring would be moving. 
...
"Down the road, if we could have a thing like this in
space, you could send the building blocks and let them
evolve themselves," said Yoseph Bar-Cohen, director of
a robotics lab at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
"That would be fascinating." 
"

I also posted a story at TransDot about it, at
http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/article.pl?sid=00/08/31/0123259

Nevertheless, a modified reality is not thereby a pluralized reality.
Definitions are, of necessity, almost always tautologies. It's the nature of
language.

If it's real, it is by definition part of reality.
Obviously you can invent as many imaginary "realities" as you like.
But if you have multiple realities, the question remains: By what term or word
will you refer to the sum of all realities? And is not the sum of all of them a
single set?

No problem with that -- it doesn't contradict that fact of one reality.

Also, Visit this site and download the GOLEM@Home screensaver.  It's like
SETI@Home, but it uses the same evolutionary robot creation program
discussed in the article Ziana told us about.  I loaded it at work.  It's
pretty darned cool.  The robots start off VERY wussy, but now I have 3
legged robots (huh huh) zooming all over the place.  And - since it's
distributed computing, the readme file says that creatures (what they call
the robots) may migrate from your PC to another PC somewhere on the network
and vice-versa.  Also, as the "creator" of the creatures, you're given a
copyright (though I'm not sure what good that does) for whatever designs
your computer comes up with.  I'm leaving my computer running all night - it
oughta be fun to see what's spawned by tommorow morning.

Does anyone know if it is legal for me to put images up on my Techstropia
site which are linked to other sites?  For example, is it legal for me to
show a photo from the NY Times site even if I'm only linking to it (it's not
residing on my server)?  I know I'm not explaining this well, but maybe
someone understands... If it's not legal, do you think anyone would give a
damn?  If I give credit?

Just wondering...

This discussion of borganization brings to mind someone I know (not on this
list) for whom any discussion is synonymous with no-holds-barred combat. I
would characterize him as an arrogant s.o.b. :)  Finding oneself in a borg
interface with this person, especially if there were no retreating from the
interface, would be equivalent to being in warfare for survival.

I imagine the subjective experience of borganization in general would very
often be similar to finding oneself one of the personalities of a person
with multiple personality disorder. Conflict would be very likely.

The conclusion I draw from these thought experiments is that I would want
psychotherapy to become a mature discipline and all of the participants in
the borganization to be thoroughly healed of all psychological scarring and
stress lines before they attempted an interface. Perhaps there should first
be a mastery of the limbic system in line with David Pearce's Hedonistic
Imperative.

More generally, this would be a good thing before undertaking many of the
augmentations that we extropians look forward to. Otherwise we might create
some very dangerous situations.

Does it need to make it to the mainstream?  Lots of things stay outside the
mainstream, but still have influence.

I agree, and in some interesting ways. Even materialist athiests I know
seem to have "spiritual" experiences on psychadelic... etc. in fact, I
happen to think that science offers a profound way of understanding and
effectively promoting these experiences... (brain machines, smart drugs,
even raves, music, new forms of community organization..)

My challenge here, ah la Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, and Richard
Bandler, is to move from Spiritual as a NOUN for a person ("He is a
spiritual person, etc.") and transform it into a VERB! ("That
sex/drug/experience was soooooo spiritual! It was great!") 

With smiles! (ExTRIPianistic ones!)

Hi Everybody,

For the last five years, I've been tinkering with one of the most powerful
self-metaprogramming tools I've found, known as NLP or Neuro-Linguistic
Programming!

I can't help but think of the ways that a community as creative and
intelligent as Extropians could use NLP in ways to extend life and
transform greater!

The funny think is that once people reach a certain level of skill with
NLP, they almost become Extropianistic, in their behaviors! Many only as a
personal level, but most even at a social and technological level. If
there are individuals on this list who would like to bring their personal
life to the same level of Extropy their mind is at, I welcome you to look
at this interesting technology!

Are there any other NLPers on this list!?!

Please make yourself known, and share your thoughts on
Extropianistic-Lingusitic Programming uses!

in SMI2LE,

- Eric

Umm...eh?  The numbers don't come out at all.

500 megahertz = 500,000,000 cycles per second
500 megahertz * 1000 ops per cycle = 500,000,000,000 ops per second
1051 O.P.S. / 500,000,000,000 O.P.S = a number much less than 1039

Just to be pedantic: that's transforming it from an ADJECTIVE into an
ADJECTIVE.

Spuddy,

I'm actually kinda into this wierd stuff... if you (...or any extropic
person...) want to read a text file called:

Is the Physical Universe of Spacetime the Creation of a Spritual Machine?

...before I put it on the server,  just write & I'll send it to you...

I appreciate the criticism. No matter how stinging.

Hey, while searching for low-brow TV I stumbled upon battlebots, which
was on the comedy channel of all things.  Two 100 kg robots, no
restriction on
design (except no explosives) fight each other to the death.  This is
exactly the kind of thing I had in mind when I suggested new sports,
where optimal strategies are not yet known, allowing for creative
design.
This show has it all: destruction of property, gonzo engineering, fight
to the
death, power, speed, mayhem, total guy stuff.  Ahhhhh bliss.  {8^D

Yes, I know about NLP, but I think it is a little expensive to learn.
Reading books may not give you enough information because NLP also involves 
body language and your voice too.

If you want to take a seminar, I wouldn't suggest taking it from anybody 
else but the creator of this field Richard Bandler, and it costs about $3500 
for the first level.

I have read many books about this subject and I think it helped me a lot in 
my life and my relationships but I still feel something is missing. As soon 
as I get my PhD and make some money, I am planning to attend a seminar.

> If it's real, it is by definition part of reality.

Then you are creating a set which only has value if there is such a thing as
"not"real.  But by your own definition, no such things exist (i.e.: Reality
= All things)  Again, this definition has no value because it is not a
description that contains any information.

I'm suggesting a different way of looking at things entirely.  I accept the
concept of reality as a working model, but I do not have absolute belief in
an external reality.  Not yet anyway.  We do not currently have the ability
to perceive reality directly.

Actually, it does.  If we draw the distinction you agree to above, the only
'fact' we have is in our perception of reality.  Your belief in the
existence of one reality is an article of faith, not fact.  Under current
operating conditions we are slaves to a sensory mode of existence.

Belief in reality makes perfect sense-- it fulfills our need for causal
relationships.  This is a very human way of looking at the world.  We posit
that in the action of throwing a ball, a real object has moved from point A
to point B.  We may or may not be correct.  It may later be revealed, for
instance, to have been a VR simulation (and you, the unwitting subject.)
Again, belief in reality is obviously a good working model.  It is a
convention of your mind that facilitates your existence.  I prefer however
to leave that sliver of skeptism in my mind-- I trust my senses, but if the
nature of things is shown to be fundamentally different, then I am prepared
to be flexible.  Further, I am prepared to believe in no "nature of things"
at all-- that we live in the emergent vapor of an existence that is
illusory, for instance.

Heady stuff and apparently of very little practical use other than mental
excercise.

I do hold however, that there are very practical ways in which we can
leverage the plasticity of our perception of reality into control over that
reality.  If I could sit you down in a room and have a conversation with you
about it, I would, because a written explanation would be tiresome-- I'd
have to spend too much time convincing you I was talking about something
rational.  Indeed, extremely rational.

Thanks in advance.

They might be using a glass or metal master, or something.

Moreover, the life time depends on storage conditions, and how much
work you're willing to undertake to retrieve the content. CDs stored
in liquid nitrogen should be good for several kiloyears at least, even 
if some of them might delaminate the coating (but you could still read 
the pits with a proximal probe).

Speaking of which, could we all now please make a combined effort, and
try to bring the list out of the current bad S/N regime?

This means less one-liners, me-too's, cocktail party chatter, etc. 

Pretty please?

Considering what I think most or at least many of us think about the likes of
Kuhn, thats a pretty meaningless statement. Bigotry is distain or hate that is
not based on rational argument or actual facts. Hating individuals or groups who
have in fact done heinous things, for example, is not bigotry, because it is
factually well established why they are to be hated, no stereotypes or
prejudices are involved. Hating individuals who are members of groups that have
done heinous things in the past, but which they themselves as individuals have
not done, and show no evidence of doing, is prejudicial, but it is also arguable
that it is a prejudice with some merit, though not conclusive by any means. The
more we know about such individuals allows us to better judge whether or not
they are deserving of our distain.

What is natural is that, in accordance with the scientific principle, given
enough examples of people in a certain group that do prove their right to our
distain, it is natural for people to lend credence to rules about certain
patterns (BTW: This is actually directly contradictory to Kuhn, who claims its a
matter of class struggle).

So the questions to debate are:

Can ideas or opinions merit distain?
Under what criteria do they properly earn distain?
Are any people who espouse those ideas or opinions to be accorded the distain
consistent with those ideas or opinions?
Under what criteria are such people to be accorded that level of distain?

Now, Al, contrary to what you might think, I do have difficulty with the level
of vehement distain that many people on the list have for anyone or anything
spiritual, mystical, or religious. I have constrained my own statements here,
for example, I say that in my experience, only some or many of the mystical
people I know are know nothing zipperheads who don't like to think. I most
explicitly did not say I think that all such people are.

Nobody I know here believes IN the Singularity. Some believe it is likely to
happen. It is a theory, and a theory which will not be proven until we actually
live through it or observe another civilization going through it. That is pretty
much understood here. We don't have 'faith' in the Singularity, it is merely a
prediction. Even those here who likely stray closest to belief or faith in the
Singularity, IMHO, are rational enough that I think if evidence can be shown
that it will not happen, that evidence will be given respect and examination in
a relatively unbiased manner.

Nobody I know of on this list is sitting on a street corner in a robe with a
sign shouting "The Singularity is Near!". We are not waiting for nano-santa.

They meant "and carries out up to 2 parallel operations each second".. The
editor must have gotten confused and multiplied those two numbers together.
A Pentium III can issue and return two instructions per cycle. An Athlon can
issue and return three, basically.
500 x 2 = 1000

Wednesday's Boston Globe reported an interesting article on the amount of
patent applications currently pending approval in biotech.  This raises
some very interesting questions about the viability of genetic ownership
and the ethics of having patents on genetic material...something covered

Spike, 'sports' requires at least a semblance of extertion by the human
participants. Battlebots is merely automated demolition. Golf barely qualifies
as sports...

BB is fun though. Comedy Channel is IMHO the most innovative network at the
moment.

OK, I'll take a shot.

Under standard accounts, decisions are made by combining positions
on values and beliefs about facts.  One considers all the possible
relevant states of the world, and beliefs about facts are about how
likely each state is given each action, while positions on values
are about how much one would like each state compared to the others.

People on this list seem to disagree with those not here about many
decisions, so it can make sense to ask: do those disagreements tend
to be more about values, or more about facts?

If we mainly disagree due to differing opinions about the possible
future paths of human technology, or about the effects of political
interventions on economic progress, or about how happy people would
feel if they modified themselves in various ways, then we are
disagreeing mainly about facts.

If we mainly disagree due to our putting a larger weight on future
consequences, or a large weight on being influential in whatever
future comes, or to being less repelled by being highly modified,
or to being less concerned about inequality or to biosphere losses,
or to expecting more dramatic technological progress, then we are
disagreeing mainly about values.

There is less scope for being "right" in disagreements about values.
Once we understand what we want, and opponents decide they don't want
that, there isn't that much more to say to them.  "Advocacy" then
consists mostly in seeking out people who haven't considered the
issue and getting them to pick sides.  And if there end up being
lots more of them than of us, we may just lose big time.

There is more to say when we and opponents disagree about facts,
because in that case we fundamentally share the same interests, and
are just trying to deal with asymmetric information.  But in that
case we should take very seriously the fact that others disagree
with us.  Even if they haven't articulated their reasoning to our
satisfaction, we have also failed to do so for them, and assuming
they aren't stupid we have to realize that they may know things
that show why we are wrong.

So which is it, do our disagreements with opponents tend to be more
about values, or more about facts?

Our ideas are already percolating into the mainstream. Getting credit for them
is not neccessarily important.

This story was on the front page of today's New York Times.
Bill Joy is quoted, he's very very unhappy. I think the reporter
who wrote the story is unhappy too, the doomsday tone in the
article is almost as strong as when the first report of Dolly was
splashed on the front page of that same newspaper.

Hey Eric,

I don't know whether I'd go so far as to call myself an NLPer, but I've
found the concepts to be some of the most useful of all the intangible
tools I possess.  In an earlier post you seemed to be associating Richard
Bandler's work with things spiritual.  Perhaps he's gone down other paths
since I studied NLP several years ago, but I would have classified his
work as scientific rather than spiritual (as your earlier post implied).

I'll be glad to post more about NLP if anyone on the list is interested,
or to talk about it offlist.  

Barbara

Sexist, Spike, sexist -- wake up and smell the millennium. Actually the 
winner of last year's Battlebots was a young girl of about ten or eleven. She 
had some kind of ladybug thing made out of a toilet seat with a rotor saw 
inside that ate everyone's bot for breakfast and spit it out.

Actually Battlebots was kinda lame.  The "bots" are just various sized remote 
control tanks with saws, hammers, hooks, traps, etc. I am not going to go 
again, though I was very excited when I saw the posters (the graphics made it 
look way cooler than it was) What is was was "cute". And really 
white-trash.Cool, heheHEHheh.

We saw it at the big Pyramid in Long Beach and they make you sign some kind 
of waver saying if you die, it's not their fault. I guess they meant by 
shrapnel, or boredom, not sure which.

The audience looked like The Cure meets World Wrestling Federation. 

I recommend large quantities of beer if you want to endure more than about 
fifteen minutes of it.

PS
They did have some cool robot stuff for sale at the concession stands.

PSS One hopes that it will evolve into something really truly interesting, 
and that someday they'll use actual robots, programmed ones.

Hmmm, I think this promotes tolerance, and perhaps openness towards new
ideas. It's of course always helpful to be skeptical, and one needn't
accept everything (or anything). In my own life I find this philosophy
to be very useful in practical, day to day situations. It enables me to
see the 'good', and imfo there is always some 'good', in people or
groups whom extropians as a group seem to want to make enemies.

I agree.  Glorified Nintendo action wears thin pretty quickly.

As you suggest, I also think that it would be wicked cool if the robots
were totally autonomous i.e. only had an on/off switch and no manual
controls.  Having machines that operated on programmed (and particularly
adaptive) behaviors would make the event far more academically interesting
and less predictable.

Well, why one earth would it be only one? Sounds like you're looking for 
choosing one tactic to turn them to your line of thinking. Varying tactics 
are needed depending on the outcome of your decision here. 

Obviously it's both. It's not true you can't change a persons' values, but 
you can't do it by arguing facts, you're right about that.

You speak of what we may learn from our "opponents".** Many of the objections 
will be in the form of values, feelings and priorities.Values are not easy to 
talk about. So you'll find the 'fact' disagreements sounding like strong 
arguments, and the 'value' disagreements will be vague sounding like 
"well...I'm unsure.. it's not right... and I'm not comfortable". 

In the realm where most extra-rationals live, it's far more likely they'll 
argue than provide comfort.

Values I think. I agree with Bill Joy and even Jeremy Rifkin that the future is important,
I agree that it's important to be happy there; but what would make me happy apparently
has the opposite effect on those two gentleman. There is no disputing matters of taste.

One the other hand we disagree on what "I" means, and I'm not entirely sure if you'd call
that a value or a fact.

It was a good rhyme, but I don't see how Crowely did anything that was 
scientific. He was good at gaining attention during the 1920's in Great 
Britain, though. Reminds me of Ozzie Osborne's song "Oh Mister Crowley".

Sure, there are now enough fascinating and differing opinions at this point 
in time to at least keep ourselves open to certain ideas, even though they 
may just be someone's personal conjecture. At some point, according to 
Freeman Dyson, scientists will be able to engineer new machines and thus 
generate new discoveries, to either prove or falsify hypotheses.  For a bit 
of intellectual fun, one can go to Dr. Jack Sarfatti's Star Drive 
Website.-http://www.stardrive.org/title.shtml

Woo! Our geeks are brainier than your geeks.

Teams from 35 countries in 4 cathegories (small size, midsize, purely
virtual simulation league and Sony legged league -- yep, AIBOs with
custom firmware) will be present.

(Here's the official website, btw http://www.battlebots.com)

There's something similar called "Robot Wars" (http://www.robotwars.co.uk/) 
on the BBC. It's rather tame (just short-range stabbing/slashing/bashing 
weapons, no hardened steel etc.) but nonetheless fun. They also have 
"Robolympics" (or whatever they're called), which are tamer still. IMO they 
should get rid of the audience and allow just about any kind of weapon as 
long as it doesn't blow the whole arena to Hell. Guns, flame throwers and 
grenades could make such shows a lot more fun. Imagine, for example, a 
small "tank" with a .50 armor-piercing sniper cannon as its primary weapon. 
Would make a fine "house robot", don't you think?

They should also let more robots fight each other at the same time, and use 
(small) planes and boats as well as land vehicles. Another idea would be to 
fit both large and small robots ("AI" or remote-controlled) with paintball 
guns (you have full-auto versions, for example), laser tag equipment and/or 
stun devices, and let them "hunt" humans, which would be armed with some 
kind of non-lethal weapons themselves. Man against machine, the wave of the 
future! Put them all in some nice apocalyptic setting (a la _Running Man_) 
and let them fight it out. To make things even more interesting, several 
(groups of) humans could compete against each other, as well as against 
machines.

Of course, in the show were hosted in certain non-western regions, you 
could use real bullets etc., which would significantly boost its 
entertainment value. There are probably thousands of people who would 
readily risk their lives to win, say, $1,000,000, and many millions who 
would watch the show. It could be broadcast over the Net, for example, to 
bypass sanctimonious TV regulations, and of course you could sell videos etc.

Everyone wins (well, except those who get killed/injured, obviously): a 
poor but persistent/fit/smart person gets a chance to become rich 
overnight, the audience gets it kicks, AI researchers get rewarded for 
coming up with a "killer" design and the army/police/private security 
agencies can use the best models for combat/guard duty etc.

To use robots, AI or remote-controlled, as guards (and possibly as rat 
catchers etc. as well) in warehouses, factories, prisons, office buildings 
or even private residences would be a good idea regardless of the whole 
game concept. Even today's primitive AIs already can learn how to outsmart 
humans, and beat them every time. The robots could be fitted with a wide 
range of camera gear, lethal/nonlethal weapons, fire fighting equipment etc.
Superior to human guards in just about any aspect; don't need sleep, don't 
have to pay them, never complain about anything, aren't corrupt, lazy, 
cowardly or reckless, can be made much tougher (armored) than humans, no 
sentimental/legal issues if one gets damaged or destroyed, never get bored 
etc. etc. Most burglars are in fact bumbling idiots, and would be easy prey 
for a "single-minded" pack of such robots. Sentinel robots have great 
commercial potential, IMHO, and are right up the transhuman alley...

Early in the century experiments showed that events at a sufficiently small
scale could not be modeled by classical Newtonian mechanics.  Quantum Theory was
developed to present a predictive model of these repeatable, but seemingly
strange results.  There is no grounds for mysticism here, although throughout
history, lack of knowledge has been used to justify belief in the supernatural.
Lack of knowledge provides neither support nor refutation.  Thomas Jefferson
wrote, "Ignorance is preferable to error, and he is closer to the truth who
believes nothing than he who believes what is wrong."

They showed that non provable truths exist *outside* our logic & epistemology,
not inside.  The fact that some non provable proposition *could* be true, does
you no good in trying to break the symmetry among all non-falsifiable beliefs.
(A symmetry which is generally broken simply by the existing beliefs of the
family one is born into.)

Certainly some of  these folks know a great deal about their beliefs, and it is
scientific to try to use our reasoning to discover why they have these beliefs.
I read the following two paragraphs from _The Meme Machine_ by Susan Blackmore,
to a group discussing this topic at the last Foresight Senior Associates
gathering:

-    Like it or not, we are surrounded by religions.  The 'Great Faiths' of the
- world have lasted thousands of years and affect our calendars and
- holidays, our education and upbringing, our beliefs and our morality.
- All over the world people spend vast amounts of time and money
- worshipping their gods and building glorious monuments in which to
- do it.  We cannot get away from religions, but using memetics we can
- understand how and why they have such power.
-    All the great religions of the world began as small-scale cults, usually
- with a charismatic leader, and over the years a few of them spread to take
- in billions of people all across the planet.  Imagine just how many small
- cults there must have been in the history of the world.  The question is
- why did these few survive to become the great faiths, while the vast
- majority simply died out with the death of their leader or the dispersal of
- their few adherents?

Scientific skepticism can look like bigotry to those not used to it.  That is
not to deny any exists.  The way you find out is to present your ideas and
counter the objections with facts and reason.

Actually,

Sarfatti's not as nutty as people make him out to be... he certainly has
charisma... perhaps he's a bit too forceful ...I just wish he didn't adhere
so adamantly to the Bohmian scenario.

But once we develop quantum computers we'll probably find out: not only will
they handle exponential problems in polynomial time - but they'll probably
(in these weird scenarios) solve Turing Incomputable problems in polynomial
time - or even flat time.

Then, the "smarter" ones would probably be able to access the vacuum and
violate a lot of conservation laws...

There's also a gentleman by the name of Roger Gouin who has some neat ideas
on this stuff (not explicit mysticism)... do a google search uh, Roger Gouin
origin of space ... that should do it...

Of course we have multiple problems here:

1) we must measure the current state of things, using a patently 
   unreliable instrument: ourselves

2) the world is a very large and highly complex place, clearly
   we can't claim to have sampled its state exhaustively. 
   Sometimes (I suspect pretty often) things are so muddied, 
   that even supposedly rational strategies are worse than a 
   purely randomly chosen strategy. Being super-rational might
   be bad for you, at least on the short run.

3) to choose the best outcome (assuming, the outcomes we seek are
   identical, which is certifiably not true) from countless future
   trajecotries we must extrapolate these highly sketchy 
   measurements using a most vague internal model of the world 
   (a world which is not only nonlinear and hence fundamentally 
   long-term unpredictable), but often even perverse from round
   to round, as artefacted by co-evolution.

So even if we agree on the goals (which we must communicate,
introducing another source of errors), due to above reasons we will
not adapt a homogenous strategy (which, incidentally, would be
predictable, and hence potentially exploitable -- just as pests blight
the crop monoculture more easily than an alpine meadow).

Surprise, surprise: diversity is good for you.

Of course our values are different (albeit less heterogenous than from
a randomly picked Jane Doe), but we even tend to disagree about these
pesky facts. Speaking of which: let's talk about guns.

Sure, that's possible. Right now most people adhere to traditional
values (I just had an argument with a physicist at the gym today, as a
Christian and believer in an immortal soul he had a distinctly
different view on the matter of transhumanism).

Hey, one should always reexamine one's beliefs. While my core values
are probably pretty much permanently write-protected the rest of it is
most assuredly not. I think I'm even trying to be over-flexible,
trying to compensate for onsetting age value calcification.

I'd say it can only be decided from case to case. Duh.

Actually, no, quantum computers are not expected to solve exponential
problems in polynomial time.  More precisely, there are no problems
known to be exponential on classical computers which are polynomial on
quantum computers.

Quantum computers can cut the exponent down on search problems, which
are known to be exponential on both kinds of computers.  The speedup
is potentially even greater on some special math problems (factoring
for example) but the true complexity of those problems on convential
computers is not known.

Quantum computers are not at all expected to solve Turing uncomputable
problems like the halting problem.  From what I understand, they are
subject to the same proofs of uncomputability.

Ken,

Before I go any further... I almost sure that we have slightly different
concepts of the term "mysticism".

I use the term to describe any epistemological framework that allows
inclusion of intuitive or meditative insight that can be incorporated into
an empirical model of experiential reality without prior Turing Computable
empirical justification.

Notice, I haven't precluded screening out whole classes of insight.... just
that such a mystical framework does not reject outright all knowledge that
happens to be derived solely or largely  from intuition, introspection
etc...

The mystical knowledge may well be justified by empirical hindsight.

That being said... there's lotsa grounds for mysticism in Quantum
Mechanics... the fact that you can't easily shake the observer out of the
paradigm... the fact that a deterministic Quantum Wave function still has to
be mapped to physical reality via a totally probabilistic Born criterion...
and the fact that quantum computers seem to exist.

As Henry Stapp points out; the Von Neumann formulation frankly allows a
spiritual (ie non-material and perhaps Turing Incomputable...) side of
things.

The Nineteeth century is over. My gosh, the Twentieth is almost washed up
too.

We no longer exist in a Turing Computable Universe... It is possible - and
some people like Stapp; like Sarfatti, hope to show that it is this
component of the Universe that accounts in part for some of the computation
that our minds perform.

Their approach is theoretico-empirical.

An empirical approach can lead to the demonstration that mystiocal knowledge
(ie, knowledge obtained via turing incomputable processes) might exist.

But certainly, the current theoretical formulation of both QM &
Conmputational Theory encourages, rather than discourages such an outlook.

Sure but I am against supernaturalism, not "enlightenment." I would propose
David Hume to the list
(prime mover of the Scottish Enlightenment) .... he was a ground-breaking
atheist philosopher with
much more of substance to him than Nietzsche, who was only good for a few
soundbites!

how can be  "enlightened" and hold false beliefs, such as in God & an
after-life?
I would accept Buddha as 'post-human' since he is anti-dogmatic, but not
Mohammed (although I never met the bloke, and I'm sure he was a great guy).

Robotic Vision
Two papers in this week's issue of Nature push forward the task of creating
robots which mimic the way living creatures evolve and behave. Lipson and
Pollack report a system which designs, 'evolves' and manufactures simple
robots with almost no human intervention. A computer simulation using
genetic algorithms which mutate a simple body plan was used to design robots
capable of horizontal motion. The computer system could then test these
simulations in the physical world by building the robots using a
rapid-prototyping technology. In an accompanying News and Views article
Rodney Brooks explains how this research contributes to the development of
self-evolving machines. In a separate study Krieger et al show that robots
programmed to co-operate in an ant-like manner are able to complete a
foraging task in a more efficient manner than single robots. Their Khepera
robots were found to recruit assistance from other robots, in the same way
ants co-operate to gather food, when they came across a resource cluster.
Both sets of robots can be seen in action by following the links to the
supplementary information provided by the authors.

Digital organisms are computer programs that are designed to mimic
evolutionary processes by mutating and reproducing. Their use is
controversial, but they might allow scientists to ask questions about
evolution that cannot be answered easily by studying real organisms. Such
organisms have been used to study how multiple mutations in the same
organism interact, with combined effects that can be greater or less than
the sum of their parts.

Classically, philosophers have used this division.  As Cicero wrote, "de
gustibus non est disputatum", there's no accounting for taste.  There's no
use trying to persuade someone about matters of taste, and values can be
thought of as just our personal taste when applied to ethical questions.

Sometimes, though, differences that appear to be on values are actually
on implicit factual assumptions.  Someone may say that they just have
an inherent dislike of the idea of being uploaded, and they would never
support a future where that is commonplace.  This appears to be a matter
of values.  However upon further discussion it may turn out that they
are assuming that upload life would have certain qualities that it might
not, such as absence of emotions or some kind of cold, logical quality
to the world.  The apparent value difference is actually largely due to
factual disagreements about the nature of the uploaded world.

Many of the areas where extropians are different from other people lie in
scenarios that will be exotic and unfamiliar.  Concepts like uploading,
singularity, AI, nanotech, intellectual and physical augmentation, will
all be new to most people.  It may well be that an initial negative
reaction to these proposals is due as much to questions of fact as to
values.  With sufficient discussion and dialogue, it may be possible to
overcome people's initial "instinctive" aversion to extropian scenarios.

Also, there seem to be different levels of values.  I feel that most
people have a meta-value which encourages them to adopt values similar
to those around them.  Over time, then, success in persuading people
and in organizing them around a value system can lead to more people
adopting that system.  So even a true difference in values is something
that can be overcome, although I think different tactics must be used.

First of all my response here is a 'quick take', rather then an astute 
analysis of your hypothesis. My first observation inspires me to remember 
Eugene Wigner's lecture in 1961 regarding the Extrodinary Accuracy of 
Mathematics. (I am para-phrasing!)

You approach seems to be along the lines of theorists such as Max Tegmark, 
James Higo, Jacque Mallah, and others on Wei Dai's Everything list. Nick 
Bostrom has his version of your hypothesis (he did it for a Phd. thesis at 
Oxford just this year) These theories have several flavors, and for the most 
part I have considerable trouble understanding them, conceptually, so bear 
with me. 

Observer -oriented theories are the hot properties nowadays, simply because 
they simply a lot of physics, however-falsifiabliity, is one of their 
weaknesses. Both Stapp and in his own fashion Moravec seem to see 
counsciousness, from a purely physical point of view as being akin to an 
electron collapsing to a ground state. 

Quantum mysticism asside, theories such as these are useful, primarilly, in 
the long term and answering some of the Big Questions. Accelerating the 
quality of life and the length of existence itself , might be a different 
genre' altogether. Why? Because people looking at the ultimate state of the 
universe, the restoration of life, may disdain such projects as cryogenics 
and uploading. (the parting on the left is now parting on the right?) I for 
one am a big, fat, pragamtist, who says freeze, cure, upload, whatever we 
have to do to save lives and make it better for all.

My final concern, and maybe this is one you ought not to try to answer is; 
what do you see as the physical mechanism for mind and its post-mortem 
preservation? Will we have to bulid hyper-netowrks capable of soul-cathching, 
or is there a physical process already in place, existing in the universe, 
and what might that be?  Possible joke responses (I can hear them already)

It seems to me that many of the people who dislike these concepts have
taken some time to become familiar with them.  What fraction of "random"
people who one of us forces to become familiar with these concepts
comes to endorse them?  We should by now have enough experience telling
our spouses, friends, coworkers, etc. about these ideas to estimate this.
If the fraction is small, it becomes harder to attribute most negative
reactions to simple ignorance and risk-averse avoidance of the unfamiliar.

In my experience, most ordinary mortals exposed to the Singularity get it on
the first try.  It's the people who think they know something that you've got
to watch out for.

Hal,

I understand this. But the usual expectations of quantum orthodoxy are not
what I'm speaking about.

In this mysticism thing, I'm referring to the ideas of people who see modern
QM as a degenerate form of a wider case. Who see room for the empirical
validation of mysticism & spiritism in physics already hinted at by the
developments in quantum & computational science of the first half of the
20th century.

If quantum computations arise out of a much bigger set than the continuum...
(eg., in a many worlds situation - if the manifold was
(uncharacteristically) also propagated for each one of the superpositions
as, I think, the physics maverick Roger Gouin pointed out...), then it may
be possible to do wierd things.

Check my wording that you quote below... I'm not asserting things about
classical quantum machines, cool as they admittedly are; I'm suggesting
things about quantum weirdness that might arise if we continue the trail in
the 21st century  - following the spirit of the formulations done in the
20th century... and what we might find when we go and actually build mature
quantum computers.

If quantum computations arise, not in this physical manifold but, beyond...
in some set much larger than that amenable to our current mathematical
analysis, then this might show up in the things that I mentioned.

Certainly the trail is suggestive - the QWF is deterministic to a flaw; yet
the stupid Born criterion isn't... I smell a rat there!

The nice thing about all this is that it's empirically testable - and we can
actually start doing real experiments shortly ( 3 - 10 years); as the
quantum computer technology becomes available.

Actually... hmmm... one is available - it's quite degenerate. A tunnel
diode. You can look at it as a quantum computer that outputs a random stream
of numbers. If it doesn't - you'd better ask why.
***************************

As for the very last part of your letter, remember the poor Turing machine
runs on some serious limitations, it's crummy tape is denumerable and not
even dense. Ugh!

So it's quite possible that quantum systems of the types we're positing are
not computationally isomorphic with an infinite Tiring (...er, Turing...)
machine. From that you might beable to swing a deterministic yet
'noncomputable' universe.

'Anti-age' drug found

Anti-ageing research might one-day lead to a fitter and longer retirement

For the first time, scientists have succeeded in boosting an animal's life 
span with drugs. 
Microscopic worms given the therapy lived nearly 50% longer than normal. 

The researchers say the experiments are the first real indication that ageing 
can be treated. 

They believe the drugs might be useful for combating human diseases that 
strike in later life. 

Clinical trials for disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
could take place in the near future. 

'Youthful and active' 

"As far as we know, this is the first convincing example of drugs being used 
to extend life span," said Dr Gordon Lithgow of the University of Manchester, 
UK, who carried out the research along with colleagues in the United States. 

He said the drugs had an anti-ageing effect on the worms. 

"The treated worms appear youthful and active at the same time as when the 
untreated worms are showing the characteristics of old age," he told BBC News 
Online. 

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans was used in the studies.

Matthew Gill, University of Manchester)
 
This tiny creature has been studied in the laboratory for many years. The 
first living thing to have its genetic blueprint decoded, around 40% of the 
worm's genes are also found in humans. 

The scientists added a cocktail of two synthetic drugs to the medium in which 
the worms, when kept in the laboratory, live and reproduce. 

Both of the drugs are antioxidants. They mimic the effect of natural enzymes 
that mop up free radicals - highly reactive molecules that damage cells. 

When given the drugs, the worms lived on average nearly 50% longer than 
normal. 

Fighting free radicals 

The reason, the scientists believe, is that the drugs prevented free radical 
damage. 

Other experts say the research is interesting but must be duplicated in 
creatures other than the worm. 

"The idea that antioxidants might have an effect [on ageing] has been around 
for quite a long time," said Professor David White, director of science at 
the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK, which is 
funding research into the science of ageing. 

"It seems to have a dramatic effect in worms," he added. 

"Whether it will have the same effect in other organisms will have to be 
established." 

The research is published in the journal, Science.

Research Shows Potential Of "Nanojets" For Smaller Circuitry & Injecting 
Genes 

Liquid jets a few nanometers in diameter could one day be used for producing 
ever-smaller electronic circuitry, injecting genes into cells, etching tiny 
features and even serving as fuel injectors for microscopic engines. 
But on these smallest of size scales, physical processes are often different 
than at larger scales, forcing engineers to reconsider both their 
expectations of how such nanoscale devices would perform -- and the 
established physical equations governing them. 

Writing in the August 18 issue of the journal Science, Georgia Institute of 
Technology researchers suggest that jets as small as six nanometers in 
diameter may be possible to produce, though these tiny devices would require 
special conditions to operate and be particularly sensitive to effects not of 
concern at more familiar size scales. 

"We are now being driven by fundamental, technological and economical 
considerations to explore and evaluate systems that are smaller and smaller," 
explained Dr. Uzi Landman, director of Georgia Tech's Center for 
Computational Materials Science. "We need to understand these systems, 
because basic physics issues are especially important to them. There is no 
point in trying to make devices of this size scale without knowing what their 
physical behaviors and fundamental limitations are going to be." 

To study jets just a few nanometers in diameter, Landman and collaborator 
Michael Moseler used molecular dynamics simulations to observe how some 
200,000 propane (C3H8) molecules would behave when compressed within a tiny 
reservoir and then injected out of a narrow nozzle made of gold. Operating on 
an IBM SP-2 parallel processing computer, the simulations recorded the 
dynamics of the fluid molecules on the femtosecond time scale over periods of 
several nanoseconds. 

The researchers first faced problems producing extended jets from the propane 
reservoir, to which they had applied 500 MegaPascals (5,000 Atmospheres) of 
pressure. Their simulations suggest that the jet would quickly clog as a film 
several molecules thick formed on the outer surface of the nozzle. 

"A key to the formation of these jets is fighting certain phenomena that 
occur upon exit of the jets from the nozzle," Landman noted. "Films 
condensing on the nozzle exterior surfaces start to thicken and eventually 
block further outflow from the nozzle. Such films are not of great concern on 
the macroscopic scale, but become key to the ability to form nanoscale jets." 

To counter formation of the films, the researchers heated the outer surface 
of the nozzle to evaporate the film. In real-world applications, it may be 
possible alternatively to apply a coating that would prevent the propane 
molecules from adhering to the outer surface. 

Once able to maintain the flow of propane, the researchers studied the 
properties of their simulated nanojets. Among the findings: 

* Jets exiting from the nozzle into a simulated vacuum achieved a relatively 
high velocity of up to 400 meters per second. 


* Friction of the pressurized fluid moving through the nozzle heats the 
propane, turning it to "a very hot fluid." Upon exit from the nozzle, rapid 
evaporation of molecules from the surface cools the jets, reducing their 
diameter by about 25 percent. 


* After exit from the nozzle, instabilities caused by thermal fluctuations 
affect the jets' shape. Each jet forms a series of "necks" that cause it to 
resemble "links of sausage connected to one another." Ultimately, one of the 
necks "pinches off" and a droplet of propane separates itself from the jet. 


* The jets remain intact, propagating as a whole over shorter distances than 
would macroscopic jets under similar conditions. Landman and Moseler observed 
jets extending 150-200 nanometers, in contrast to results of deterministic 
Navier-Stokes calculations predicitng 500-nanometer-long jets. These 
observations matched the researchers' predictions based on modifications of 
the hydrodynamic equations to include the effect of stress fluctuations. 


* As they break up, the jets form droplets of remarkably uniform size. Noted 
Landman: "In applications such as fuel injectors, this is a very important 
aspect because of the issue of efficient burning of the droplets." 

In a second phase of their work, the researchers attempted to reconcile the 
predictions of traditional fluid dynamics equations -- that is, Navier-Stokes 
-- to their observations. They found that these equations did not account for 
the effect of thermally-induced fluctuations which significantly affect the 
stability of nanojets. These fluctuations are of much less importance at 
larger size scales. 

"At the small length scale that we are dealing with here, fluctuations become 
amplified," Landman said. "There are always fluctuations or noise in all 
natural phenomena. But as the scale of the physical system decreases, then 
the amplitude of the relative effect of such fluctuations becomes stronger 
and stronger." 

Reformulating the hydrodynamic equations allowed Landman and Moseler to 
properly describe what they had observed in their atomistic simulations. 
Their modified equations can now be used by other researchers to predict the 
behavior of nanojets of other materials under other conditions. 

"With this fluctuating description, hydrodynamics becomes valid even on the 
molecular scale," Landman said. 

In certain real-world applications, the jets would be formed under conditions 
where they may collide with molecules in the ambient environment. Such 
collisions may somewhat reduce the length of the jets, and cause additional 
perturbations, he added. 

As a next step, the researchers would like to create nanojets experimentally 
and use them to apply patterns that could replace current lithographic 
processes in the manufacture of nanoscale miniaturized circuits. They could 
potentially also be used as "gene guns" to insert genetic materials into 
cells without causing damage. 

"They could be very economical and perhaps allow one to achieve things that 
are not available technologically any other way," Landman added. 

The work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Air Force 
Office of Scientific Research and in part by the Deutsche 
Forshungsgemeinschaft.

Hi List,

Is the use of antioxidants drugs to extend; average lifespan; useful
reproductive lifespan; and even maximal lifespan,  new?

Haven't I read about such stuff for, like, decades?

Anyway... when someone finds out can he/she post the drugs' names on the
list? I'm dsesperate.

Thanks.

Yes, reality = all real things (and all real non-things).
Note that reality does not equal all unreal things.
Unreality = all unreal things (and all unreal non-things).
The definition remains valid and accurate.

What do you mean "we"?

I don't "believe" in one reality. I accept it as a fact of existence.

The fact that a person can be fooled into thinking that an illusion is real does
*not* mean that a separate reality exists. It simply means that people can be
fooled.

Nevertheless, the illusory existence comes from the ground of being, a single
reality with a kaleidoscopic array of illusory aspects.

Ah, but how do you know it's *really* rational, rather than merely a reasonable
illusion?

There has been a free radical theory of aging for decades but the use of 
antioxidants as a cure for aging has been elusive.  This really proves 
nothing however.  The two compounds used mimic the effects of superoxide 
dismutase and catalase, two free radical scavengers that are found in the 
human body.  C. elegans is a much simpler life form and excess of these two 
compounds in the human body would probably cause the body to stop producing 
it's own.  If these did work, however, they would only be useful in 
increasing our average life span and useful reproductive life span.  Our 
maximal lifespan can't be raised unless we rebuild our telomeres or use 
another technique to get around this problem.

This sub-thread is almost certainly the noise-over-signal kind of post
Eugene was denouncing (and I agree with him), but what the hell:

I'd lerv to watching the legged league Aibos (they're sooooo cute), but I'm
scheduled to appear on two panels at the Melbourne International Writers'
Festival on Saturday, talking to the literati about Math and litrichuh, and
about sf (my chance to blather about life extension and the singularity yet
again to an audience not normally exposed to such notions).

I received several emails telling me this post was never received, so
apologies for those who have already read it.

-------------------------------

I don't know about you guys, but the recent trends among Corporate
America to strengthen Intellectual Property Laws beyond the DMCA has got
me very concerned and agitated.  I'm all for seeing creators of
intellectual property be compensated fairly for their work, but recent
moves within our legal system are really starting to disturb me.  I
think the story "The Right to Read" by Stallman at:

http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/right-to-read.html

paints a very compelling reason to limit the protections of current
intellectual property.  The intent of copyright in the first place was
to grant the creator, for a *limited* time, a monopoly on that idea for
personal or financial gain as an incentive to spur further creativity in
society.  But now corporations have managed to co-opt this principle by
extending such protections indefinitely.  Its been the principles of
'Fair Use' that have allowed our knowledge pool to grow and evolve.  It
has been compellingly argued that if Shakespeare were alive today, he
would not have been able to publish the majority of his plays under
current IP restrictions.  Regardless of any other free-market principles
that's a pretty sobering thought.  Limiting and locking up knowledge to
the extent that corporations are now trying to do can only mean a deeper
poverty of knowledge and capital down the road.  As a person who
believes in a diverse competitive free-market the current trends in
Corporate America have really gotten me down.  Is it time for a
reassessment?  Is capitalism the problem, or is what we have so
perturbed by regulation that it can't truly be called capitalism?
Either way, their is definitely a growing unrest as to what many people
see as Corporate Power gone out of control.  The recent scuffle in
Seattle is only the beginning of more civil unrest over the issue of
Corporate Profits vs. Individual Liberties.

Jusr in the last year or so Microsoft's has campaigned successfully to
change existing ownership laws and rights in 5 states to favor their
leasing paradigm.  Is this a sign of much worse things to come?  Already
Microsoft has taken a strong position that when you buy their software
by saying you do not own your copy, you are only licensing the right to
*use* it.  And along with that granted right to license this software
you will be subject to all the stipulations of said license.

Beyond the fact that I wholehearted disagree with the ludicrous idea
that I  can't own software I buy, ultimately Microsoft has every right
to do with their product (I mean service) as they please.  This is all
encompassed in their their new .NET strategy by the way.  Luckily for
now, LINUX is defying this leasing model.  But what really bothers me
about this is the trend of many software companies moving away from
private ownership of software into the 'leasing a service' paradigm.

--> Already Microsoft has put into some of their licensing agreements
stipulations forbidding any user of their service from disparaging the
company in any way.  In other words, as long as your using a Microsoft
product (damn, I mean service) you have no freedom of speech, as you
signed that right away when you signed up for their service.  If you
violate this part of the license they'll yank your privileges.  It is my
understanding that a new feature implemented in Office Suite 2000, has a

mandatory connection to Big Brother (damn, I mean Microsoft).  If a
connection is severed for a certain period of time your license will be
revoked.

Hopefully big business around the world will not catch on to this nifty
loophole in our legal system as a way of stripping everyone of their
freedoms as a condition to use their service.  Of course you don't have
to use their service, but if they are the only game in town (through
sufficient merging and consolidation), your only alternative would be to
live in the proverbial tent.

I have always tried to maintain freemarket principles, but when I see
corporations gaining this much power over individual lives, I begin to
doubt those beliefs and my appreciation of capitalism as usual.  Now,
here is a scary question - is capitalism now at odds with the spirit of
a free market, and more importantly individual liberty?  For those with
strong reactions to this question, I am urging you to respond as
intelligently and rationally as you can.

Paul Hughes

P.S. Lets not forget the DeCSS case as a clear cut example of how big
business can get laws changed to successfully infringe on freedom of
speech.

I think I'll e-mail Jerry Shay, Ph.D., one of the cell
biologists at UT Southwestern who are working with
Geron. They work just down the street. I'm curious to
hear his comments on what direction he believes
telomerase research is headed. And whether there's any
interest in animal experimentation now that they've
immortalized simple cells.

Any questions you guys want me to pass on?

I believe Roy Walfords longevity studies spanning over 40 years have
demonstrated that maximum lifespan can be extended through carefully planned
caloric restriction.

Lets talk about guns??  Eugene, is this you who posted this?  The
same guy who was pleading for improved S/N ratio a few minutes ago?  {8^D

Regarding one-liners and coctail party chatter, I dont see why one-liners
should bother the extropian readership.  They often contain a meme or
thought,
(granted a small one) expressed in very few words that can be read quickly.
n addition to being a forum for the exchange of ideas, the ExI list is a
grand
party, is it not?

I countersuggest we improve S/N by avoiding loooong lightweight
posts, but tolerate the one-liners.  Especially if they are funny.  {8-]

Ja,  I should have said new "competitions" instead of the subset "sports".

The army has experimenting with this for years.  A friend of me was a
photographer up on the China Lake north ranges.  Said they had a
number of prototype battlebots under test.  Unfortunately the army
isnt talking much about the results.  {8-[  spike

The letters stand for "Neuro Linguistic Programming."   It began in the
mid-1970's as a set of models of the behavior of people who were good at
communicating, and techniques that can be used to learn the behavior of
the experts.  It may have evolved into something different by now--I
studied it in the mid-1980's.  

The models and techniques were developed  by Richard Bandler and John (?)
Grinder (I think) who set out to model the beavior of
communication-geniuses.  Among the people whose behavior they modeled
were hypnotherapist Milton Erickson, gestalt therapist Fritz Perls and
family therapist Virginia Satir.  I've seen videos of Erickson and Satir
and was quite impressed with their communications skills.

There are a couple of things I especially  like about NLP:  first, the
techniques work; second, the approach is lighthearted and optimistic and
respects the individual.  Here are some of the basic assumptions:

No one is wrong or broken. 
Behind every behavior is a positive intention. 
Every behavior is useful in some context. 
The meaning of a communication is the response you get. 
If you aren't getting the response you want, do *something* different. 
There is no such thing as failure. There is only feedback. 
In any system, the element with the most flexibility exerts the most
influence. 
The map is not the territory. 

And here's an example of Bandler's attitude towards his work  (I can
imagine him grinning as he invented the label "Neuro Linguistic
Programming"):

His experiments concerning delusional patients sound equally fun. One
poor soul who thought he was Jesus Christ got the Bandler treatment,
which sounds more like a play than medical therapy. He had arranged for
Roman costumes to be issued to members of staff and for them to patrol
outside the patient's room. Bandler went into the room donning full Roman
outfit, carrying two huge planks of wood, some very large nails and an
even bigger hammer. It wasn't long before the patient started protesting
that he wasn't Jesus at all and Bandler responded in true jobsworth
style, 'sorry mate, out of my hands, just following orders..'. Soon
enough the patient, who had thought himself to be Christ for years, had
remembered exactly who he was.

Yes, Nadia, we must remember that this oppressed minority, the
bandwidth people, are humans just like you and me.  No one
should have the right to slaughter them.

I doubt that the fact/value distinction holds up under close scrutiny.  What 
seem like values almost always represent positions held only contingent on 
certain factual assumptions.  Take, for example, valuing "the environment."  
Though proponents of environmentalism often present it as a per se good, they 
in truth accept certain claims--industrialism increases human suffering, 
ecosystems exist in balanced harmony absent human intervention, population 
growth increases pollution, and so forth--that may or may not be facts.  Only 
at a very fundamental, arational level--seek social status, maximize 
pleasure/pain ratios, reproduce, and so forth--do values not rely on beliefs 
about facts.  And at that level, almost everyone agrees.
